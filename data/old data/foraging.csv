Temporal and spatial variation of flower resources affects foraging decisions of wild and honey bees. To optimise crop pollination management a better understanding of potential competition for pollinators in mass- and minor-flowering crops is needed. We combined waggle dance decoding, pollen load analysis and field surveys to identify the habitat preferences and pollen use of honey bees in response to spatio-temporal changes in resource availability. Observation hives were placed on the edge of eleven fields of blooming strawberries (mean 2.24 ha) located in landscapes with different amounts of oilseed rape (OSR), semi-natural habitats (SNH) and apple trees in Germany. In addition, we surveyed honey bees and wild bees in strawberry fields. Honey bee dances more often indicated strawberry, OSR fields and SNH than expected given their landscape-wide areas. Honey bees collected on average 7.9 % strawberry, 49.0 % OSR, 30.2 % Pyrus type (e.g. apple) and 12.9 % other pollen types. The mean honey bee foraging distance was 740 m, and decreased with OSR availability. In the observation hives, dances for strawberry fields were not directly affected by OSR availability or SNH land cover. But large amounts of OSR reduced overall honey bee and bumble bee abundance in strawberry fields, while solitary bees were unaffected. Bumble bees were most abundant in strawberry fields (54.1%) and together with solitary bees (19.7%) they represented about 75.0% of the observed bees. Minor-flowering strawberry fields represent a preferred resource for honey bees, especially for small colonies as indicated by decoding of waggle dances. However, the availability of more attractive OSR and local strawberry flower cover moderates the abundance of social bees (honey bees and bumble bees) in strawberry fields while other wild bees were less affected. Hence, we conclude that wild bee conservation plays a major role for strawberry pollination. If pollination services by solitary bees are limited, small honey bee hives can be used scrupulously to supplement pollination services in strawberries.

Bombus hypnorum, the Tree Bumble Bee, is unusual in that it has recently rapidly expanded its range, having colonized much of the UK mainland since 2001. However, the spatial ecology of B.Â hypnorum has not previously been investigated. To address this issue, and to investigate whether specific features of the spatial ecology of B.Â hypnorum are associated with its rapid range expansion, we used 14 microsatellite markers to estimate worker foraging distance, nest density, between-year lineage survival rate and isolation by distance in a representative UK B.Â hypnorum population. After assigning workers to colonies based on full or half sibship, we estimated the mean colony-specific worker foraging distance as 103.6Â m, considerably less than values reported from most other bumble bee populations. Estimated nest density was notably high (2.56 and 0.72 colonies ha âˆ’1 in 2014 and 2015, respectively), estimated between-year lineage survival rate was 0.07, and there was no evidence of fine-scale isolation by distance. In addition, genotyping stored sperm dissected from sampled queens confirmed polyandry in this population (mean minimum mating frequency of 1.7 males per queen). Overall, our findings establish critical spatial ecological parameters and the mating system of this unusual bumble bee population and suggest that short worker foraging distances and high nest densities are associated with its rapid range expansion.

However, the spatial ecology of B.Â hypnorum has not previously been investigated. To address this issue, and to investigate whether specific features of the spatial ecology of B.Â hypnorum are associated with its rapid range expansion, we used 14 microsatellite markers to estimate worker foraging distance, nest density, between-year lineage survival rate and isolation by distance in a representative UK B.Â hypnorum population. After assigning workers to colonies based on full or half sibship, we estimated the mean colony-specific worker foraging distance as 103.6Â m, considerably less than values reported from most other bumble bee populations. Estimated nest density was notably high (2.56 and 0.72 colonies ha âˆ’1 in 2014 and 2015, respectively), estimated between-year lineage survival rate was 0.07, and there was no evidence of fine-scale isolation by distance. In addition, genotyping stored sperm dissected from sampled queens confirmed polyandry in this population (mean minimum mating frequency of 1.7 males per queen). Overall, our findings establish critical spatial ecological parameters and the mating system of this unusual bumble bee population and suggest that short worker foraging distances and high nest densities are associated with its rapid range expansion.

However, it is unknown how increasing areas of mass-flowering crops like oilseed rape (Brassica napus; OSR) or a decrease of seminatural habitats (SNH) change the temporal and spatial availability of pollen resources for honey bee colonies, and thus foraging distances and firequency in different habitat types. We studied pollen foraging of honey bee colonies in 16 agricultural landscapes with independent gradients of OSR and SNH area within 2 km and used waggle dances and digital geographic maps with major land cover types to reveal the distance and visited habitat type on a landscape level. Mean pollen foraging distance of 1347 decoded bee dances was 1015 m (Â± 26 m; SEM). In spring, increasing area of flowering OSR within 2 km reduced mean pollen foraging distances from 1324 m to only 435 m. In summer, increasing cover of SNH areas close to the colonies (within 200 m radius) reduced mean pollen foraging distances from 846 to 469 m. Frequency of pollen foragers per habitat type, measured as the number of dances per hour and hectare, was equally high for SNH, grassland, and OSR fields, but lower for other crops and forests. In landscapes with a small proportion of SNH a significantly higher density of pollen foragers on SNH was observed, indicating that pollen resources in such simple agricultural landscapes are more limited. Overall, we conclude that SNH and mass-fowering crops can reduce foraging distances of honey bee colonies at different scales and seasons with possible benefits for the performance of honey bee colonies. Further, mixed agricultural landscapes with a high proportion of SNH reduce foraging densities of honey bees in SNH and thus possible competition for pollen resources.

Urban habitats often support considerable biodiversity and so are of conservation value, even though they are highly modified ecosystems. Urban parks and gardens are rich in flowers that provide food for pollinators, including bees. Here, we use waggle dance decoding to investigate foraging by 3 honey bee hives located in the city of Brighton, UK, over almost an entire foraging season, April to October. Waggle dances were recorded using video cameras and decoded during framewise playback on a computer by measuring the angle and duration of the waggle phase. Foraging was mostly local (mean monthly distances 0.5â€“1.2Â km) and mostly within the surrounding urban area (monthly means 78â€“92Â %) versus the countryside (closest distance 2.2Â km) even though this was well within the honey bee maximum foraging range (c. 12Â km). These distances were lower than those from a previous study for hives located in a rural area 4.5Â km away. Honey bees are very sensitive to foraging economics and foragers make waggle dances only after visiting high-quality feeding locations. Low distances advertised by dances, therefore, indicate sufficient forage nearby and show that urban areas can support honey bees year round. As a corollary, however, urban bees may provide little pollination service to agriculture especially in spring, which had the lowest foraging distances and is when the most economically important animal-pollinated UK crops, apple and oilseed rape, are in bloom.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we report the first successful use of micro radio telemetry to track flight distances and space use of bumblebees. Using ground surveys and Cessna overflights in a Central European rural landscape mosaic we obtained maximum flight distances of 2.5 km, 1.9 km and 1.3 km for Bombus terrestris (workers), Bombus ruderatus (worker), and Bombus hortorum (young queens), respectively. Bumblebee individuals used large areas (0.25-43.53 ha) within one or a few days. Habitat analyses of one B. hortorum queen at the landscape scale indicated that gardens within villages were used more often than expected from habitat availability. Detailed movement trajectories of this individual revealed that prominent landscape structures (e.g. trees) and flower patches were repeatedly visited. However, we also observed long (i.e. >45 min) resting periods between flights (B. hortorum) and differences in flower-handling between bumblebees with and without transmitters (B. terrestris) suggesting that the current weight of transmitters (200 mg) may still impose significant energetic costs on the insects. Conclusions/Significance: Spatio-temporal movements of bumblebees can now be tracked with telemetry methods. Our measured flight distances exceed many previous estimates of bumblebee foraging ranges and suggest that travelling long distances to food resources may be common. However, even the smallest currently available transmitters still appear to compromise flower handling performance and cause an increase in resting behavior of bees. Future reductions of transmitter mass and size could open up new avenues for quantifying landscape-scale space use of insect pollinators and could provide novel insights into the behavior and requirements of bumblebees during critical life stages, e.g. when searching for mates, nest locations or hibernation sites.

Using a population genetics approach, we determine the impact of habitat and floral resource distributions on nesting and foraging patterns of a critical native pollinator, Bombus vosnesenskii. Our findings demonstrate that native bee foraging is far more plastic and extensive than previously believed and does not follow a simple optimal foraging strategy. Rather, bumble bees forage further in pursuit of species-rich floral patches and in landscapes where patch-to-patch variation in floral resources is less, regardless of habitat composition. Thus, our results reveal extreme foraging plasticity and demonstrate that floral diversity, not density, drives bee foraging distance.

Using a population genetics approach, we determine the impact of habitat and floral resource distributions on nesting and foraging patterns of a critical native pollinator, Bombus vosnesenskii. Our findings demonstrate that native bee foraging is far more plastic and extensive than previously believed and does not follow a simple optimal foraging strategy. Rather, bumble bees forage further in pursuit of species-rich floral patches and in landscapes where patch-to-patch variation in floral resources is less, regardless of habitat composition. Thus, our results reveal extreme foraging plasticity and demonstrate that floral diversity, not density, drives bee foraging distance. Furthermore, we find a negative impact of paved habitat and a positive impact of natural woodland on bumble bee nesting densities.

Here we quantify queen dispersal in two common bumblebee species in an arable landscape. Dispersal was measured by taking DNA samples from workers in the spring and summer, and from queens in the following spring, at 14 sites across a landscape. The queens captured in the spring must be full sisters of workers that were foraging in the previous year. A range of sibship reconstruction methods were compared using simulated data sets including or no genotyping errors. The program Colony gave the most accurate reconstruction and was used for our analysis of queen dispersal. Comparison of queen dispersion with worker foraging distances was used to take into account an expected low level of false identification of sister pairs which might otherwise lead to overestimates of dispersal. Our data show that Bombus pascuorum and B. lapidarius queens can disperse by at least 3 and 5 km, respectively. These estimates are consistent with inferences drawn from studies of population structuring in common and rare bumblebee species, and suggest that regular gene flow over several kilometres due to queen dispersal are likely to be sufficient to maintain genetic cohesion of ubiquitous species over large spatial scales whereas rare bumblebee species appear unable to regularly disperse over distances greater than 10 km. Our results have clear implications for conservation strategies for this important pollinator group, particularly when attempting to conserve fragmented populations.

Dispersal was measured by taking DNA samples from workers in the spring and summer, and from queens in the following spring, at 14 sites across a landscape. The queens captured in the spring must be full sisters of workers that were foraging in the previous year. A range of sibship reconstruction methods were compared using simulated data sets including or no genotyping errors. The program Colony gave the most accurate reconstruction and was used for our analysis of queen dispersal. Comparison of queen dispersion with worker foraging distances was used to take into account an expected low level of false identification of sister pairs which might otherwise lead to overestimates of dispersal. Our data show that Bombus pascuorum and B. lapidarius queens can disperse by at least 3 and 5 km, respectively. These estimates are consistent with inferences drawn from studies of population structuring in common and rare bumblebee species, and suggest that regular gene flow over several kilometres due to queen dispersal are likely to be sufficient to maintain genetic cohesion of ubiquitous species over large spatial scales whereas rare bumblebee species appear unable to regularly disperse over distances greater than 10 km. Our results have clear implications for conservation strategies for this important pollinator group, particularly when attempting to conserve fragmented populations.

Molecular studies have estimated that bumblebee colonies can be established many kilometers from their queensâ€™ natal nest site. However, little is known about when and how queens disperse during their lifespan. One possible life stage when dispersal may occur, is directly after emerging from hibernation. Here, harmonic radar tracking of artificially over-wintered Bombus terrestris queens shows that they spend most of their time resting on the ground with intermittent very short flights (duration and distance). We corroborate these behaviors with observations of wild queen bees, which show similar prolonged resting periods between short flights, indicating that the behavior of our radar-monitored bees was not due to the attachment of transponders nor an artifact of the bees being commercially reared. Radar-monitored flights were not continuously directed away from the origin, suggesting that beesÂ were not intentionally trying to disperse from their artificial emergence site. Flights did not loop back to the origin suggesting bees were not trying to remember or get back to the original release site. Most individuals dispersed from the range of the harmonic radar within less than two days and did not return. Flight directions were not different from a uniform distribution and flight lengths followed an exponential distribution, both suggesting random dispersal. A random walk model based on our observed data estimates a positive net dispersal from the origin over many flights, indicating a biased random dispersal, and estimates the net displacement of queens to be within the range of those estimated in genetic studies. We suggest that a distinct post-hibernation life history stage consisting mostly of rest with intermittent short flights and infrequent foraging fulfils the dual purpose of ovary development and dispersal prior to nest searching.

Research has shown that they achieve this feat by memorizing landmarks and the skyline panorama, using the sun and polarized skylight as compasses and by integrating their outbound flight paths. In order to investigate the capacity of the honeybees' homing abilities, we artificially displaced foragers to novel release spots at various distances up to 13 km in the four cardinal directions. Returning bees were individually registered by a radio frequency identification (RFID) system at the hive entrance. We found that homing rate, homing speed and the maximum homing distance depend on the release direction. Bees released in the east were more likely to find their way back home, and returned faster than bees released in any other direction, due to the familiarity of global landmarks seen from the hive. Our findings suggest that such large scale homing is facilitated by global landmarks acting as beacons, and possibly the entire skyline panorama.

Given these abilities, if a worker is displaced, will it switch to a new forage resource close by or will it navigate back to the original forage patch? To address this question we collected 210 Bombus vosnesenskii workers from an ornamental Spirea patch, marked them with numbered tags, transported them in a cooler, and released them at seven distances, from 1.5 km to 16 km, in each of two directions. Each worker that returned to the Spirea patch was recaptured, and re-released at its first release location. Over 8 observation days, 54 workers from 11 release locations returned to the Spirea patch. Of these, 16 were recaptured twice, 13 three times, 5 four times and 1 five times. Nine workers returned from release distances â‰¥10 km, including one from 16 km, despite the presence of multiple rewarding resources between the release location and the Spirea patch. Returns were rapidâ€”three workers released up to 5 km away were recaptured within 4 h, while a worker from 13 km returned within 30 h of release. Wind direction, wind speed, and release direction had significant (P < 0.05) impacts on release-to-recapture-times. Also, workers returned significantly (P < 0.001) more quickly during subsequent trips compared to their first return. These findings highlight the ability of displaced bumble bee workers to travel long distances, and to navigate back to familiar forage patches.

Here, we examined foraging patterns of Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski in late-season blooming clover in the agriculturaldominated Willamette Valley in Oregon. Workers from 10 fields collected over 2 yr were assigned to full sibling families (colonies) by using eight microsatellite loci. With estimation of numbers of unseen species, we inferred the presence of 189 colonies from 433 bees genotyped in year 1, and 144 from 296 genotyped the next year. Worker foraging distance was estimated to be at least 11.6 km, half the distance between the most remote fields visited by the same colonies. Numbers of nests contributing workers to each field ranged from 15 to 163. Overall, 165 (50%) colonies foraged in two or more fields, and thus used common resources within the landscape. Estimates of average nest densities in the landscape each year ranged from 0.76/km 2 to 22.16/km 2, and highlighted the influences of various study parameters incorporated into the calculation including sample size, distances between sites, and analytical tools used to estimate unsampled individuals.

Their contribution to this essential ecosystem service has been threatened over recent decades by changes in land use, which have led to declines in their populations. In order to design effective conservation measures, it is important to understand the effects of variation in landscape composition and structure on the foraging activities of worker bumble bees. This is because the viability of individual colonies is likely to be affected by the trade-off between the energetic costs of foraging over greater distances and the potential gains from access to additional resources. We used field surveys, molecular genetics, and fine resolution remote sensing to estimate the locations of wild bumble bee nests and to infer foraging distances across a 20-km2 agricultural landscape in southern England, UK. We investigated five species, including the rare B. ruderatus and ecologically similar but widespread B. hortorum. We compared worker foraging distances between species and examined how variation in landscape composition and structure affected foraging distances at the colony level. Mean worker foraging distances differed significantly between species. Bombus terrestris, B. lapidarius, and B. ruderatus exhibited significantly greater mean foraging distances (551, 536, and 501 m, respectively) than B. hortorum and B. pascuorum (336 and 272 m, respectively). There was wide variation in worker foraging distances between colonies of the same species, which was in turn strongly influenced by the amount and spatial configuration of available foraging habitats. Shorter foraging distances were found for colonies where the local landscape had high coverage and low fragmentation of seminatural vegetation, including managed agri-environmental field margins. The strength of relationships between different landscape variables and foraging distance varied between species, for example the strongest relationship for B. ruderatus being with floral cover of preferred forage plants. Our findings suggest that management of landscape composition and configuration has the potential to reduce foraging distances across a range of bumble bee species. There is thus potential for improvements in the design and implementation of landscape management options, such as agri-environment schemes, aimed at providing foraging habitat for bumble bees and enhancing crop pollination services.

We used field surveys, molecular genetics, and fine resolution remote sensing to estimate the locations of wild bumble bee nests and to infer foraging distances across a 20-km2 agricultural landscape in southern England, UK. We investigated five species, including the rare B. ruderatus and ecologically similar but widespread B. hortorum.

Mean worker foraging distances differed significantly between species. Bombus terrestris, B. lapidarius, and B. ruderatus exhibited significantly greater mean foraging distances (551, 536, and 501 m, respectively) than B. hortorum and B. pascuorum (336 and 272 m, respectively). There was wide variation in worker foraging distances between colonies of the same species, which was in turn strongly influenced by the amount and spatial configuration of available foraging habitats. Shorter foraging distances were found for colonies where the local landscape had high coverage and low fragmentation of seminatural vegetation, including managed agri-environmental field margins. The strength of relationships between different landscape variables and foraging distance varied between species, for example the strongest relationship for B. ruderatus being with floral cover of preferred forage plants.

However, studies on this aspect concerning stingless bees usually do not take into consideration their homing ability. The objectives of this study were to verify the maximum distance that foragers of Melipona mandacaia Smith can fly, and whether experience is relevant for their homing ability in a Caatinga region of Northeast Brazil. Five colonies were used to collect foragers. These were marked and released starting from 100 m from their nests and at every 100 m up to a maximum distance on which there would be no bee returning to the nest. To evaluate the influence of experience, after being marked, another group of bees was put back into colonies, collected again after eight days and released in five distances only (500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 and 2,500 m). In both experiments, as the distance increased, the returning success of the bees decreased significantly. In fact, there was a significant negative correlation between their returning success and the distances they were released. The maximum distance a translocate bee returned to its hive was 2,700 m. The percentage of success was very high for bees released at 500 and 1,000 m (100% and 77%, respectively), suggesting this is the common flight range for the species. In most cases, average percentage of success was significantly higher for experienced bees than for other bees reinforcing the idea that experience is quite relevant for homing ability.",Article,Scopus,yes,South America,Brazil,natural - savanna,Apidae,Melipona mandacaia,Female,,Social,,Polylectic,homing,75,Max,2700,,,,,,,

However, local resource partitioning does not fully explain the species diversity of bumblebee communities. Theoretical studies provide new evidence that partitioning of space can promote species coexistence, when species interact with their environment at different spatial scales. If bumblebee species possess specific foraging ranges, different spatial resource utilisation patterns might operate as an additional mechanism of coexistence in bumblebee communities. We investigated the effects of the landscape-wide availability of different resources (mass flowering crops and semi-natural habitats) on the local densities of four bumblebee species at 12 spatial scales (landscape sectors with 250-3,000 m radius) to indirectly identify the spatial scales at which the bumblebees perceive their environment. The densities of all bumblebee species were enhanced in landscapes with high proportions of mass flowering crops (mainly oilseed rape). We found the strongest effects for Bombus terrestris agg. and Bombus lapidarius at large spatial scales, implying foraging distances of 3,000 and 2,750 m, respectively. The densities of Bombus pascuorum were most strongly influenced at a medium spatial scale (1,000 m), and of Bombus pratorum (with marginal significance) at a small spatial scale (250 m). The estimated foraging ranges tended to be related to body and colony sizes, indicating that larger species travel over larger distances than smaller species, presumably enabling them to build up larger colonies through a better exploitation of food resources. We conclude that coexistence in bumblebee communities could potentially be mediated by species-specific differences in the spatial resource utilisation patterns, which should be considered in conservation schemes.

If long-distance movements are habitual, rare plants in widely scattered locations may benefit from euglossine pollination services. Here we report the first successful use of micro radio telemetry to track the movement of an insect pollinator in a complex and forested environment. Our results indicate that individual male orchid bees (Exaerete frontalis) habitually use large rainforest areas (at least 42-115 ha) on a daily basis. Aerial telemetry located individuals up to 5 km away from their core areas, and bees were often stationary, for variable periods, between flights to successive localities. These data suggest a higher degree of site fidelity than what may be expected in a free living male bee, and has implications for our understanding of biological activity patterns and the evolution of forest pollinators.
