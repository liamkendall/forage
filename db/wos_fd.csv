Recent changes in climate and land-use have led to breeding range expansions in many species but it is unclear whether these populations also establish new migratory routes, non-breeding sites and migration phenology. Thus, we compared the migration patterns of European Bee-eaters Merops apiaster from two established western (n = 5) and eastern (n = 6) breeding populations in Europe, with those from a newly founded northern population (n = 19). We aimed to relate the breeding populations to the two known non-breeding clusters in Africa, and to test for similarities of migration routes and timing between the old and new populations. Western Bee-eaters used the western flyway to destinations in West Africa; the eastern birds uniformly headed south to southern African non-breeding sites, confirming a complete separation in time and space between these long-established populations. The recently founded northern population, however, also used a western corridor, but crossed the Mediterranean further east than the western population and overwintered mainly in a new non-breeding area in southern Congo/northern Angola. The migration routes and the new non-breeding range overlapped only slightly with the western, but not with the eastern, population. In contrast, migration phenology appeared to differ between the western and both the northern and the eastern populations, with tracked birds from the western population migrating 2-4 weeks earlier. The northern population thus shares some spatial traits with western Bee-eaters, but similar phenology only with eastern population. This divergence highlights the adjustments in the timing of migration to local environmental conditions in newly founded populations, and a parallel establishment of new breeding and non-breeding sites.",,,,,"Zehtindjiev, Pavel/0000-0002-9786-3974; Dhanjal-Adams, Kiran/0000-0002-0496-8428; Emmenegger, Tamara/0000-0002-2839-6129; Alves, Jose/0000-0001-7182-0936",,,,,,,,,,,,0019-1019,1474-919X,,,,APR,2020,162,2,,,SI,,345,355,,10.1111/ibi.12752,,,,,,,WOS:000518963000007,,,,,

Temporal and spatial variation of flower resources affects foraging decisions of wild and honey bees. To optimise crop pollination management a better understanding of potential competition for pollinators in mass- and minor-flowering crops is needed. We combined waggle dance decoding, pollen load analysis and field surveys to identify the habitat preferences and pollen use of honey bees in response to spatio-temporal changes in resource availability. Observation hives were placed on the edge of eleven fields of blooming strawberries (mean 2.24 ha) located in landscapes with different amounts of oilseed rape (OSR), semi-natural habitats (SNH) and apple trees in Germany. In addition, we surveyed honey bees and wild bees in strawberry fields. Honey bee dances more often indicated strawberry, OSR fields and SNH than expected given their landscapewide areas. Honey bees collected on average 7.9 % strawberry, 49.0 % OSR, 30.2 % Pyrus type (e.g. apple) and 12.9 % other pollen types. The mean honey bee foraging distance was 740 m, and decreased with OSR availability. In the observation hives, dances for strawberry fields were not directly affected by OSR availability or SNH land cover. But large amounts of OSR reduced overall honey bee and bumble bee abundance in strawberry fields, while solitary bees were unaffected. Bumble bees were most abundant in strawberry fields (54.1%) and together with solitary bees (19.7%) they represented about 75.0% of the observed bees. Minor-flowering strawberry fields represent a preferred resource for honey bees, especially for small colonies as indicated by decoding of waggle dances. However, the availability of more attractive OSR and local strawberry flower cover moderates the abundance of social bees (honey bees and bumble bees) in strawberry fields while other wild bees were less affected. Hence, we conclude that wild bee conservation plays a major role for strawberry pollination. If pollination services by solitary bees are limited, small honey bee hives can be used scrupulously to supplement pollination services in strawberries.",,,,"Westphal, Catrin/F-9560-2015","Westphal, Catrin/0000-0002-2615-1339",,,,,,,,,,,,0167-8809,1873-2305,,,,Apr-01,2020,291,,,,,,,,UNSP 106792,10.1016/j.agee.2019.106792,,,,,,,WOS:000514930700007,,,,,

Honey bees use visual attributes of the targeted food source, such as its color, shape, size, direction and distance from the hive, and the landmarks around it to navigate during foraging. They transmit the location information of the food source to other bees if it is highly rewarding. To investigate the relative importance of these attributes, we trained bees to feeders in two different experiments. In the first experiment, we asked whether bees prefer to land on (a) a similar feeder at a different distance on the same heading or on (b) a visually distinct feeder located at the exact same location. We found that, within a short foraging range, bees relied heavily on the color and the shape of the food source and to a lesser extent on its distance from the hive. In the second experiment, we asked if moving the main landmark or the feeder (visual target) influenced recruitment dancing for the feeder. We found that foragers took longer to land and danced fewer circuits when the location of the food source, or a major landmark associated with it, changed.

Furthermore, as interest in urban agriculture has grown, so has a need for studies of urban pollinator ecology and pollination. Analyzing pollinator assemblages along a rural-urban gradient provides powerful mechanistic insight into how urbanization impacts pollinators. Yet, studies examining pollinators along urban-rural gradients are limited and results vary. Since pollinators vary tremendously in life history characteristics and respond to urbanization differently, studies from different regions would improve our understanding of pollinator response to urbanization. This study documents different bee assemblages along a high-plains semi-arid urban-rural gradient in Denver, Colorado, USA. Percent impervious surface was used to define the extent of urbanization at 12 sites and local and landscape characteristics were estimated using field assessments and geospatial analysis. Wild bees were collected and the relationships between urbanization and bee communities were explored using linear modeling. Overall, bee abundance and diversity decreased with increasing urbanization, suggesting that urban areas negatively impact bee communities. However, all bee guilds responded positively to local floral richness and negatively to the degree of landscape urbanization, suggesting that different types of bees responded similarly to urbanization. These findings suggest that providing a greater diversity of floral resources is key to mitigating the negative impacts of urbanization on pollinator communities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-8155,1573-1642,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11252-020-00956-w,,Mar-20,,,,,WOS:000518343900001,,,,,

Abundance and diversity in flower availability benefit bee populations; however, little is known about which of protein or carbohydrate resources may limit their growth and reproductive performance. Here, we test the hypothesis of complementary resource limitation using a supplemental feeding approach. We applied this assumption with bumble bees (Bombus terrestris), assuming that colony growth and reproductive performance should depend on the continuous supply of carbohydrates and proteins, through the foraging for nectar and pollen, respectively. We placed wild-caught bumble bee colonies along a landscape gradient of seminatural habitats, and monitored the colonies' weight, foraging activity, and reproductive performance during the whole colony cycle. We performed supplemental feeding as an indicator of landscape resource limitation, using a factorial design consisting of the addition of sugar water (carbohydrate, supplemented or not) crossed by pollen (protein, supplemented or not). Bumble bee colony dynamics showed a clear seasonal pattern with a period of growth followed by a period of stagnation. Higher abundance of seminatural habitats resulted in reducing the proportion of pollen foragers relative to all foragers in both periods, and in improving the reproductive performance of bumble bees. Interestingly, the supplemental feeding of sugar water positively affected the colony weight during the stagnation period, and the supplemental feeding of pollen mitigated the landscape effect on pollen collection investment. Single and combined supplementation of sugar water and pollen increased the positive effect of seminatural habitats on reproductive performance. This study reveals a potential colimitation in pollen and nectar resources affecting foraging behavior and reproductive performance in bumble bees, and indicates that even in mixed agricultural landscapes with higher proportions of seminatural habitats, bumble bee populations face resource limitations. We conclude that the seasonal management of floral resources must be considered in conservation to support bumble bee populations and pollination services in farmlands.",,,,,"Requier, Fabrice/0000-0003-1638-3141; Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf/0000-0003-1359-3944",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,MAR,2020,101,3,,,,,,,e02946,10.1002/ecy.2946,,,,,,,WOS:000518696800008,31840224,,,,

Edges also provide favorable conditions for invasive plants, which may usurp pollinators and reduce visitation to native or crop plants. Alternatively, floral displays of alien plants may facilitate, or increase, the pollination success of adjacent plants by attracting more pollinators to the area. Therefore, pollination services of bees from seminatural habitats to crop areas should vary with the presence of invasive floral resources and distance from habitat edges. To test the hypothesis that floral resources of invasive forest shrubs affect the bee community and pollination services in adjacent crop fields, we conducted a 2-yr field experiment along forest-crop edges at five isolated forest remnants. We removed flower buds from a dominant invasive shrub, Lonicera maackii (Amur honeysuckle), along forest-crop edges and paired removals with controls of intact flowers. The bee community, their pollination services, and flower visitation rates were quantified along a 200-m gradient into an adjacent crop field using pan traps and sentinel cucumber plants. Impacts to the bee community were dependent of bee functional traits. Larger bees visited fewer sentinel cucumber flowers in flower removal plots, which corresponded with decreased cucumber pollination compared to plots with honeysuckle flowers at distances >100 m from forest edges. Small-bodied and weaker flying bees visited sentinel plants more frequently closer to the forest edge and increased pollination services to cucumber at distances L. maackii shrubs in flower removal plots. After 2 yr, bee abundance and species richness increased within flower removal plots across all distances. High functional diversity of the bee community increased pollination services to sentinel plants and increased cucumber production within 200 m from forest remnants. Our findings suggest that dense floral resources of invasive shrubs suppressed forest-edge bee communities and their pollination services, but also attracted large-bodied generalist bees, which were effective pollinators. This study helps explain how life histories and functional attributes of bees can predict either facilitation or suppression of pollination services to crop or native plants in response to invasive floral resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/eap.2078,,Feb-20,,,,,WOS:000516160400001,31971650,,,,

The blue orchard bee, Osmia lignaria (Say), is a commercially available native bee that can be employed as a copollinator with, or alternative pollinator to, honeybees in orchards. To date, their successful implementation in agriculture has been limited by poor recovery of bee progeny for use during the next spring. This lack of reproductive success may be tied to an inadequate diversity and abundance of alternative floral resources during the foraging period. Managed, supplementary wildflower plantings may promote O. lignaria reproduction in California almond orchards. Three wildflower plantings were installed and maintained along orchard edges to supplement bee forage. Plantings were seeded with native wildflower species that overlapped with and extended beyond almond bloom. We measured bee visitation to planted wildflowers, bee reproduction, and progeny outcomes across orchard blocks at variable distances from wildflower plantings during 2015 and 2016. Pollen provision composition was also determined to confirm O. lignaria wildflower pollen use. Osmia lignaria were frequently observed visiting wildflower plantings during, and after, almond bloom. Most O. lignaria nesting occurred at orchard edges. The greatest recovery of progeny occurred along the orchard edges having the closest proximity (80 m) to managed wildflower plantings versus edges farther away. After almond bloom, O. lignaria nesting closest to the wildflower plantings collected 72% of their pollen from Phacelia spp., which supplied 96% of the managed floral area. Phacelia spp. pollen collection declined with distance from the plantings, but still reached 17% 800 m into the orchard.

K.",,,Field design can affect cross-pollination and crop yield in strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa D.),AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"The distance travelled by pollinators between successive flower visits can affect the quality of pollen transferred among plants. In cropping environments, especially monoculture systems, pollinators that travel between plants or rows may increase cross-pollination and consequently crop yield. However, the most commonly utilized crop pollinator, Apis mellifera L., tends to forage consecutively on nearest-neighbouring plants within rows. The level of cross-pollination can be further restricted in crops that are propagated by cloning. When a clonal variety is planted over large areas, the potential for outcrossed pollen deposition could be limited, regardless of pollinator flight distances. To investigate how pollinator movement and varietal diversity interact to affect crop pollination, we conducted an experiment with wild and honey bees in single- and multiple-variety strawberry fields. We hypothesized that the amount of cross-pollination provided by wild bees in multiple-variety strawberry fields would be greater than in single-variety fields, and greater than that provided by honey bees in either field type. We found that, indeed, flowers visited by wild bees produced larger strawberries than those visited by honey bees in multiple-variety plots, but only in the more self-incompatible of the two strawberry varieties tested. Strawberries resulting from honey bee pollination were of similar size regardless of the number of varieties planted in the field. Our results show that certain multiple-variety strawberry fields can benefit from the irregular foraging patterns of some solitary bee species, leading to increased cross-pollination and crop yield. Strawberry growers could take advantage of this effect by planting multiple varieties in close proximity and by supporting wild bee populations on farms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-8809,1873-2305,,,,Feb-15,2020,289,,,,,,,,UNSP 106738,10.1016/j.agee.2019.106738,,,,,,,WOS:000500218500009,,,,,

Male bumblebees have an energetically expensive lifestyle, and so understanding their foraging choices may provide a first step towards designing interventions to support them in the wild. Using a series of controlled laboratory choice experiments, we demonstrate that males prefer sugar concentrations of between 50 and 60% when under either simple (binary) or complex (octanary) choice conditions when presented with a broad range of sugar concentrations. When presented with concentrations within this preferred range, males exhibit a clear preference for sugar solutions of 56% w/w sucrose when solutions differ by 4%.

Hair fields between various joints have been eliminated as likely sensors for slope measurement, without affecting slope detection; nor do postural adaptations or changes in gait provide the relevant information. Changes in the sky's polarization pattern due to different head inclinations on slopes were ruled out as cues. Thus, the mechanisms by which ants may measure slopes still await clarification. Remarkably, the precision of slope measurement is roughly constant up to a 45 degrees inclination, but breaks down at 60 degrees. An encounter of sloped path segments during a foraging trip induces a general acceptance of slopes, however, slopes are not associated with specific values of the home vector.

There was significant variation in visitor abundance and diversity by season and year for many annual ornamental cultivars. Within some genera, cultivars had similar visitor abundance, diversity, and main visitor taxa, while cultivars in other genera varied greatly in these measures. We observed only polylectic (pollen generalist) bee species visiting annual ornamentals, despite the presence of oligolectic (pollen specialist) bee species in the background population. We conclude that the attractiveness of annual ornamental plants likely depends on both cultivar characteristics and environmental context. While their role in supporting complex pollinator populations is limited both based on the number of and dietary breadth of the species they support, ornamental plants may nonetheless provide long-lasting supplemental foraging resources for the generalist pollinator communities characteristic of urban and suburban environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,1938-2936,,,,FEB,2020,49,1,,,,,178,188,,10.1093/ee/nvz133,,,,,,,WOS:000515110400020,31755522,,,,

Specifically, we examined whether foragers of this species increase their fuel loads when they have low expectation for nectar collection during a foraging trip. Crop load measurements revealed that nectar foragers carried significantly less fuel on departing the nest than foragers collecting either pollen, clay, or resin. Surprisingly, 75% of nectar foragers left the nest without any detectable amount of nectar, which suggests that the majority of bees collected at nearby nectar sources and avoided an increase in foraging costs. Moreover, foragers increased their fuel loading when repeatedly experiencing empty food sources that had previously been rewarding. These results support our hypothesis and demonstrate that the capability of fuel adjustment is not restricted to honey bees.",,,,"Maia-Silva, Camila/E-3730-2013; Maia-Silva, Camila/I-4391-2016","Maia-Silva, Camila/0000-0003-1179-7716",,,,,,,,,,,,0340-7594,1432-1351,,,,JAN,2020,206,1,,,,,85,94,,10.1007/s00359-019-01398-2,,,,,,,WOS:000511591000007,31955221,,,,

We summarize data on the threat status of wild bumble bee species across biogeographic regions, underscoring regions lacking assessment data. Focusing on data-rich studies, we also synthesize recent research on potential causes of population declines. There is evidence that habitat loss, changing climate, pathogen transmission, invasion of nonnative species, and pesticides, operating individually and in combination, negatively impact bumble bee health, and that effects may depend on species and locality.

In Missouri, where less than 1% the historical prairie remains, prairies are being reconstructed from agricultural or wooded land. Invertebrates are often assumed to colonise reconstructions if native vegetation returns; however, the limited mobility of many invertebrates, the isolation of many tallgrass remnants, and the difficulty in establishing prairie plants raise serious questions as to whether invertebrate communities on reconstructed prairies are and will be equivalent to those found on remnant prairies. Grasshoppers (Acrididae) display a range of dispersal capabilities and may be valuable for assessing the success of prairie restoration for invertebrates. Our first objective was to compare grasshopper communities on reconstructed and remnant prairies and, if differences existed, identify species or functional groups associated with each habitat type. The second objective was to evaluate the effect of time because prairie reconstruction on grasshopper communities to determine if communities on reconstructions are converging with communities on remnants. Our results suggest that prairie reconstructions in Missouri do not support the same communities of grasshoppers as prairie remnants. Grasshopper diversity was generally greater on remnants.

Here we demonstrate for the first time that honeybees can also be exposed to pharmaceuticals, commonly present in wastewater. Residues of carbamazepine (an anti-epileptic drug) up to 371 ng/mL and 30 mu g/g were detected in nectar and pollen sampled from zucchini flowers (Cucurbita pepo) grown in carbamazepine spiked soil (0.5-20 mu g/g). Under realistic exposure conditions from the use of recycled wastewater, carbamazepine concentrations were estimated to be 0.37 ng/L and 30 ng/kg in nectar and pollen, respectively. Incorporation of environmentally relevant carbamazepine residues in nectar and pollen into a modelling framework able to simulate beehive dynamics including the honeybee foraging activity at the landscape scale (BEEHAVE and BEESCOUT) enabled the simulation of carbamazepine translocation from zucchini fields into honeybee hives. Carbamazepine accumulation was modelled in 11 beehives across a 25 km(2) landscape over three years chosen to represent distinct climatic conditions. During a single flowering period, carbamazepine concentrations were simulated to range between 0 and 2478 ng per beehive. The amount of carbamazepine gathered not only varied across the simulated years but there were also differences in accumulation of carbamazepine between beehives within the same year. This work illustrates a fundamental first step in assessing the risk of pharmaceuticals to bees through realistic scenarios by demonstrating a method to quantify potential exposure of honeybees at the landscape scale. Pharmaceuticals are being inadvertently but increasingly applied to agricultural lands globally via the use of wastewater for agricultural irrigation in response to water scarcity problems.

The effects of this exposure at plant community level are unknown and difficult to assess in a scientifically appropriate manner. Such an assessment can be scientifically adequate if a studied plant community is completely new and control-impact radiation treatment is used. In this review we aimed to predict ecological effects and identify indicators of the impact of bioactive RF-EMFs at the mobile telephony frequency range on plant communities. We considered the scenario where a plant community was exposed to radiation generated by a base transmitting station antenna mounted on a nearby mast. This plant community can be represented by mesic meadow, ruderal or arable weed community, or other herbaceous, moderately productive vegetation type. We concentrated primarily on radiation effects that can be recorded for a year since the exposure started. To predict them we used physical theories of radiowave propagation in vegetation and the knowledge on plants physiological responses to RF-EMF. Our indicators can be used for the detection of the impact of RF-EMFs on vegetation in a control-impact experiment. The identified indicators can be classified into the following groups: (1) canopy parameters; (2) plant characteristics to be measured in the field or laboratory in a number of individuals that represent the populations of selected species; (3) community weighted means/medians (CWMs) of plant traits and strategies; (4) the abundance of other organisms that interact with plants and can influence their fitness or population size. The group of canopy parameters includes mean height, vertical vegetation structure and dry weight of above-ground standing phytomass. Plant characteristics requiring biometric sampling in the field are plant height, the number of fruits and seeds, as well as seed viability. The group of plant traits that are calculated as CWMs covers seed releasing height, seed dispersal mode, SLA, leaf orientation, month of germination and flowering, Ellenberg's light indicator value, and the proportion of individuals in the classes of competitors and stress tolerators according to Grime's CSR strategy scheme. The group of ""non-plant"" indicators includes primarily the frequency of flower visits by beetles, wasps, hoverflies, and bees that have their nests over ground. To detect ecological responses that occur for the first year since a herbaceous community has been exposed to potentially bioactive RF-EMF, the first two indicators groups should be used.",,,,"Januszkiewicz, Lukasz/N-1436-2014","Januszkiewicz, Lukasz/0000-0001-6693-1009",,,,,,,,,,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,JAN,2020,108,,,,,,,,UNSP 105683,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105683,,,,,,,WOS:000493902400014,,,,,

While the majority of phytophagous insects is highly host specific, generalist behavior is quite widespread among bees and presumably involves physiological adaptations that remain largely unexplored. However, floral visitation patterns suggest that generalist bees do not forage randomly on all available resources. While resource availability and accessibility as well as nectar composition have been widely explored, pollen chemistry could also have an impact on the range of suitable host-plants. This study focuses on particular pollen nutrients that cannot be synthesized de novo by insects but are key compounds of cell membranes and the precursor for molting process: the sterols. We compared the sterol composition of pollen from the main host-plants of three generalist bees: Anthophora plumipes, Colletes cunicularius, and Osmia cornuta, as well as one specialist bee Andrena vaga. We also analyzed the sterols of their brood cell provisions, the tissues of larvae and nonemerged females to determine which sterols are used by the different species. Our results show that sterols are not used accordingly to foraging strategy: Both the specialist species A. vaga and the generalist species C. cunicularius might metabolize a rare C-27 sterol, while the two generalist species A. plumipes and O. cornuta might rather use a very common C-28 sterol. Our results suggest that shared sterolic compounds among plant species could facilitate the exploitation of multiple host-plants by A. plumipes and O. cornuta whereas the generalist C. cunicularius might be more constrained due to its physiological requirements of a more uncommon dietary sterol. Our findings suggest that a bee displaying a generalist foraging behavior may sometimes hide a sterol-specialized species. This evidence challenges the hypothesis that all generalist free-living bee species are all able to develop on a wide range of different pollen types.",,,,,"Michez, Denis/0000-0001-8880-1838",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,JAN,2020,10,1,,,,,150,162,,10.1002/ece3.5868,,Dec-19,,,,,WOS:000502468300001,31993117,,,,

The observed difference might be explained by abundance differences, with declining bumblebee species having lower genetic diversity levels simply due to their lower local species abundances. However, whether this holds true is not known. Here, we investigated whether bumblebee local abundances determines population genetic diversity levels. Therefore, local species abundances were measured for bumblebee species at four locations in Belgium and two locations in Estonia during bumblebee foraging years 2013-2017. These locations and countries were chosen to ensure the greatest possible variance in both local abundances and population trends for these species. Hence, genetic diversity levels were obtained for seven species by genotyping collected specimens with 16 microsatellites. Our results showed that the observed patterns in genetic diversity did not depend on local species abundance. So, although declining bumblebee species can become locally abundant, they will still show lower genetic diversity levels than stable species. This result implies that measuring bumblebees' local abundance cannot be used to directly determine the health status of a population. Furthermore, this result has also major impact on future conservation strategies as increasing the genetic diversity levels of declining species will be very difficult, and habitat quality should be high to maintain their populations, otherwise these species are doomed to disappear first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-8021,,,,Dec-10,2019,10,,,,,,,,1262,10.3389/fgene.2019.01262,,,,,,,WOS:000504235900001,31921301,,,,

Further, the effects of different landscape structures surrounding the gardens and distance to the city center were analyzed on the total wild bee species richness and functional traits. Focusing on these putative influencing factors, statistical analyses calculating random decision forests along with generalized linear mixed models were applied. With 113 observed wild bee species, communal gardens provide habitat for a quarter of all known species in Vienna. In conclusion, results revealed that only elements within the gardens had an effect on species richness, with flower frequency as the major positive driver.

However, the habitat of bumble bee species is not fully understood. We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature using Web of Science to summarize articles that have described the habitat of bumble bee species. In total, 55 nesting and 10 overwintering habitat studies are described in this review. We described common patterns associated with bumble bee studies including overwintering habitat, landscape type, and ground position. We found that bumble bee nests are more frequently found underground and that studies were biased towards the United Kingdom and agricultural habitats. There are some preferences in nesting and overwintering habitat, but further research is needed to draw any substantial conclusions. Detection of nesting and overwintering site studies may be improved using citizen science initiatives and possibly through employing detection dogs or radio-telemetry. Increasing the detection of nesting and overwintering sites is an important priority to improve our understanding of bumble bee habitat. It is critical that we identify all aspects of bumble bee habitat to ensure the protection, restoration and creation of important resources to ensure their conservation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1366-638X,1572-9753,,,,DEC,2019,23,5-Jun,,,,,787,801,,10.1007/s10841-019-00173-7,,,,,,,WOS:000495241600001,,,,,
J,"Rollings, R; Goulson, D",,,,"Rollings, Rosi; Goulson, Dave",,,Quantifying the attractiveness of garden flowers for pollinators,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,,,,,,,,,,,,"There is great interest in planting urban areas to benefit pollinating insects, with the potential that urban areas and gardens could act as an extensive network of pollinator-friendly habitats. However, there are a great many different plant cultivars available to the gardener, and a paucity of evidence-based advice as to which plants are truly most attractive to flower-visiting insects. Here, we report insect visitation to metre square plots of 111 different ornamental plant cultivars at a site in central UK. Data were collected over 5 years, and comprise over 9000 insect observations, which were identified to species (for honeybees and bumblebees) or as 'solitary bees', Syrphidae, Lepidoptera and 'others'. Unlike some previous studies, we found no difference in numbers of insects attracted to native or non-native species, or according to whether plants were annuals, biennials or perennials, but we did find that native plants attracted a significantly higher diversity of flower-visiting insects. Overall, the most-visited plants were Calamintha nepeta, Helenium autumnale and Geranium rozanne. However, patterns of visitation were quite different for every insect taxa examined. For example, different species of short-tongued bumblebees showed little overlap in their most-preferred plant cultivars. Interestingly, very similar plant cultivars often attracted different insect communities; for example, 72% of visitors to Aster novi belgii were honeybees or bumblebees, while the related Anthemis tinctoria, which also has daisy-like flowers, did not attract a single honeybee or bumblebee but was popular with solitary bees, hoverflies, and 'other' pollinators. Some plant cultivars such as Eryngium planum and Myosotis arvensis were attractive to a broad range of insects, while others attracted only a few species but sometimes in large numbers, such as Veronicastrum virginicum and Helenium autumnale which were both visited predominantly by honey bees. It is clear that we do not yet fully understand what factors drive insect flower preferences. Recommendations are made as to which flower cultivars could be combined to provide forage for a diversity of pollinator groups over the season from early spring to autumn, though it must be born in mind that some plants are likely to perform differently when grown in different environmental conditions.",,,,"Goulson, Dave/A-2462-2010","Goulson, Dave/0000-0003-4421-2876",,,,,,,,,,,,1366-638X,1572-9753,,,,DEC,2019,23,5-Jun,,,,,803,817,,10.1007/s10841-019-00177-3,,,,,,,WOS:000495241600002,,,,,

Therefore, a grade 1 score indicates a minimal and easily reversible lesion, increased apocrine secretion, increased cell elimination into the lumen, and a larger quantity of spherocrystals; grade 2 was assigned to moderate and typically reversible injuries, such as changes in the brush border, vacuolation/loss of cytoplasmic material, presence/height of the brush border, and cell swelling; and grade 3 was assigned to serious and irreversible, loss of cell nests of regenerative cells, pyknosis, and loss of contact between Kenyon cells. In addition, frequency values were assigned since the alterations can occur at different frequencies according to the insecticide and the bees exposed; the frequency ranges from 0 to 6, with 0 representing the absence of an alteration and 6 representing a high frequency occurrence.

In tropical Australia, these alien species have recently become sympatric. The environmental and economic impacts of these species when in sympatry remain to be seen; however, any interspecific competition may be of significance. We examined conspecific and heterospecific interactions between honeybees foraging at the nectar- and pollen-providing flowers of Antipogon leptopus (Polygonaceae). We cross-classified 554 encounters by three variables; incoming bee species, resident bee species, and one of four potential responses: (1) incoming defers to resident; (2) incoming procures the flower from resident; (3) incoming and resident share the flower; or (4) both incoming and resident abandon the flower. We also measured aggression and foraging rates of workers at flowers. Both species visited similar numbers of flowers in a foraging bout and spent similar foraging times on individual flowers. Incoming A. mellifera were more likely to procure flowers from resident A. cerana, and incoming A. cerana were more likely to defer to resident A. mellifera. A. mellifera were more aggressive toward heterospecifics than conspecifics, with heterospecifics 4.5 times more likely to provoke an aggressive response. However, no significant difference between conspecific and heterospecific aggression was observed for incoming A. cerana. A. mellifera were less abundant, yet overall more likely to acquire flowers and use aggression to do so.

In plants with multiovulate ovaries, the number of conspecific pollen grains per stigma often predicts seed set and is used to quantify pollinator effectiveness. In the Asteraceae, however, florets are uniovulate, which suggests that the total amount of pollen deposited per floret may not measure pollinator effectiveness. We examined two aspects of pollinator effectiveness-effective pollen deposition and effective pollen movement-for insects visiting Echinacea angustifolia, a composite that is pollen limited in small, isolated populations. Methods We filmed insect visits to Echinacea in two prairie restorations and used these videos to quantify behavior that might predict effectiveness. To quantify effective pollen deposition, we used the number of styles shriveled per visit. To quantify effective pollen movement, we conducted paternity analysis on a subset of offspring and measured the pollen movement distance between mates. Results Effective pollen deposition varied among taxa. Andrena helianthiformis, a Heliantheae oligolege, was the most effective taxon, shriveling more than twice the proportion of styles as all other visitors. Differences in visitor behavior on a flowering head did not explain variation in effective pollen deposition, nor did flowering phenology. On average, visitors moved pollen 16 m between plants, and this distance did not vary among taxa. Conclusions Andrena helianthiformis is an important pollinator of Echinacea.

It has been demonstrated that ants can optimize their foraging path through an emergent process, involving the trail pheromone concentration, without individual ants having to measure and compare distances. In the current study, we investigated whether ants that use only tandem running to recruit their nestmates can minimize their path while relocating their entire colony into a new nest. As colony relocation directly impacts the survival of the whole colony, it would be particularly important to optimize their path to the new nest. Using the ponerine ant Diacamma indicum, we conducted relocation experiments, in which ants had to choose between different defined paths, and contrasted our findings with open arena experiments, as they navigated to their new nest. After following 4100 unique transports by 450 different transporters, we found that these ants do minimize their path. Individual leaders, as well as colonies, chose the shorter path significantly more than the longer path, and they showed a significant preference for the shorter arm at multiple decision points on encountering a combination of paths. Thus, we concluded that tandem leaders are capable of path minimization based on the information they themselves collect.

However, spatial and temporal patterns in the availability and quantity of these resources can be affected by disturbances like wildfire. The potential for spatial or temporal separation of foraging and nesting resources is of particular concern for solitary wood-cavity-nesting bees as they are central-place, short-distance foragers once they have established their nest. Often the importance of nesting resources for bees have been tested by sampling foraging bees as a proxy, and nesting bees have rarely been studied in a community context, particularly postdisturbance. We tested how wood-cavity-nesting bee species richness, nesting success, and nesting and floral resources varied across gradients of wildfire severity and time-since-burn. We sampled nesting bees via nesting boxes within four wildfires in southwest Montana, USA, using a space-for-time substitution chronosequence approach spanning 3-25 years postburn and including an unburned control. We found that bee nesting success and species richness declined with increasing time postburn, with a complete lack of successful bee nesting in unburned areas. Nesting and floral resources were highly variable across both burn severity and time-since-burn, yet generally did not have strong effects on nesting success. Our results together suggest that burned areas may provide important habitat for wood-cavity-nesting bees in this system.

We carried out three independent experiments to study the impact of acute oral treatment of 20 mu L TMX at concentrations of 2.4 ppb (0.048 ng/bee) and 10 ppb (0.2 ng/bee) on the homing, flight, learning acquisition and short-term retention ability of A. cerana. The homing ability was assessed by the catch-and-release method, the flight ability was assessed by flight mills, and the learning acquisition and short-term retention were evaluated by the proboscis extension response method. Results When treated with 10 ppb of TMX, bees had a significantly higher average homing time, mean flight velocity, flying distance, and flying duration than the control, whereas 2.4 ppb concentration did not cause any significant effect on homing or flight ability. Bees treated with either 2.4 ppb or 10 ppb TMX had significantly lower learning acquisition and short-term retention ability. Conclusion Results suggest that acute oral exposure to 10 ppb of TMX altered the short-distance homing time, flight ability, and learning acquisition and short-term retention ability. Our study also highlights the concern that acute oral exposure to a low concentration of 2.4 ppb could have consequences on the behavior of A. creana.

However, museums specimens also contain important ecological information, including rarely measured morphological traits. Trait-based assessments of museums specimens provide additional information on underlying mechanisms of population trends, by tracking changes over time.

We found that declining Bombus species were larger than increasing ones. All four species were smaller in current time than a century ago. Intra-specific size declines were more pronounced for larger-bodied species. With our sampling, declining and increasing species showed an upward shift in elevation, and declining species showed an additional geographic shift in recent times as compared to historic records.

We tested the prediction that paternal genetic diversity, outcrossing rate and realized pollen dispersal will be reduced when the primary pollinator group is excluded from bird-pollinated plants. Pollinator exclusion experiments in conjunction with paternity analysis of progeny were applied to Eucalyptus caesia Benth. (Myrtaceae), a predominantly honeyeater-pollinated tree that is visited by native insects and the introduced Apis mellifera (Apidae). Microsatellite genotyping at 14 loci of all adult E. caesia at two populations (n = 580 and 315), followed by paternity analysis of 705 progeny, revealed contrasting results between populations. Honeyeater exclusion did not significantly impact pollen dispersal or plant mating at Mount Caroline. In contrast, at the Chiddarcooping site, the exclusion of honeyeaters led to lower outcrossing rates, a threefold reduction in the average number of sires per fruit, a decrease in intermediate-distance mating and an increase in near-neighbour mating. The results from Chiddarcooping suggest that bird pollination may increase paternal genetic diversity, potentially leading to higher fitness of progeny and favouring the evolution of this strategy.

Despite accumulating knowledge on the expression profiles of genes related to honey bee behaviors, it remains unclear whether these genes actually regulate social behaviors in the honey bee, in part because of the scarcity of genetic manipulation methods available for application to the honey bee. In this review, we describe the genetic methods applied to studies of the honey bee, ranging from classical forward genetics to recently developed gene modification methods using transposon and CRISPR/Cas9. We then discuss future functional analyses using these genetic methods targeting genes identified by the preceding research. Because no particular genes or neurons unique to social insects have been found yet, further exploration of candidate genes/neurons correlated with sociality through comprehensive analyses of mushroom bodies in the aculeate species can provide intriguing targets for functional analyses, as well as insight into the molecular and neural bases underlying social behaviors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2075-4450,,,,OCT,2019,10,10,,,,,,,348,10.3390/insects10100348,,,,,,,WOS:000500573900042,31623209,,,,

Such development threatens the integrity of coastal ecosystems. Coastal dune systems contain unique sets of terrestrial invertebrates and native plants, and represent some of the last remaining areas of semi-natural habitats along the coasts. In our study, we monitored bee and flowering plant abundance and diversity within coastal dune systems located within protected lands and developed sites throughout South and Central Florida. Our aim was to assess the potential impacts dune degradation and development could have on these economically and ecologically important insects. A total of 5419 bees from 5 families and 56 taxa were captured using bowl traps. Halictidae accounted for 70% of all bees collected, followed by Apidae (28%), Megachilidae (2%), Andrenidae (0.1%) and Colletidae (0.07%). Both species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices were higher in protected lands when compared with developed sites. A majority of the commonly collected bee species showed higher abundances in protected lands compared with developed sites. Protected lands also supported higher abundances of ground, wood, and tunnel-nesting bees when compared with developed sites. Bee species richness and Shannon-Wiener indices were lower in sites with greater percentages of development occurring within close proximity to the dune systems, and higher in sites with greater availability of dune coverage. We observed higher abundance and flowering plant species richness within protected lands when compared with developed sites; protected lands also supported more federally endangered/threatened or state protected plant species compared with developed sites. Overall, coastal dune systems are ecologically important bee sanctuaries and should be conserved to help sustain native bee communities and the flowering plants that occur within them.

We studied forest bee communities in Delaware and Pennsylvania, USA, to better understand how forest bee community structure varies with changing land use and microhabitat quality among small, urban and suburban forest fragments in the mid-Atlantic United States. Our hypotheses were that (1) microhabitat quality would affect relative abundance of bee taxa, (2) surrounding landscape composition would drive local patch colonization-extinction dynamics, and (3) forest patch size would not affect community structure and composition. We found a lack of spatial autocorrelation among forest patches, indicating the importance of individual fragments in the autonomous generation and/or maintenance of bee communities. Community analyses revealed the importance of both landscape context and microhabitat quality in defining forest bee communities. By partitioning beta diversity into its constituent components, we also found that landscape composition drove changes in the relative abundance of taxa, while both landscape and microhabitat characteristics significantly influenced species turnover. Neither landscape composition nor quality of the microhabitat influenced initial site occupancy or colonization-extinction dynamics. Bisected by highways, suburban neighborhoods, agricultural lands, and urban development, many urban and suburban forest patches in the eastern United States are similar in composition to our study sites.

However, effects of seasonality on foraging distances, particularly in tropical regions, are poorly understood. Here, we use translocation ('homing') experiments, the release of marked individuals at various distances from the nest, to investigate how homing abilities of the Neotropical stingless bee, Scaptotrigona aff. postica differ across the transition between wet and dry seasons (February-August) in a heterogenous tropical landscape in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. We also determined nectar sugar concentrations of unmanipulated returning foragers to assess temporal changes in collected resource quality. Maximum and typical homing distances (i.e. distances where 90% and 50% of released bees are lost) were estimated to be 860 and 392 m, respectively, confirming that while some individuals travel long distances, most workers must remain close to nests during foraging trips. Homing distances and collected nectar sugar concentrations showed inverse temporal patterns, as homing range declined in later months (May to August), whereas nectar sugar concentrations increased over the same period. Thus, shorter homing distances in later 'dry season' months probably reflected an increased availability of floral resources compared with earlier months. Together, our findings highlight the limited spatial extent of foraging activities in S. aff. postica workers, and that bee homing distances vary with environmental conditions.

Furthermore, the effects of temperature may alter the outcome of biotic interactions, such as those with pathogens and parasites. In the context of host-parasite interactions, the beneficial acclimation hypothesis posits that shifts away from acclimation or optimum performance temperatures will impose physiological stress on hosts and will affect their ability to resist parasite infection. We investigated the beneficial acclimation hypothesis in a bumble bee-trypanosome parasite system. Freshly emerged adult worker bumble bees, Bombus impatiens, were acclimated to 21, 26, or 29 degrees C. They were subsequently experimentally exposed to the parasite, Crithidia bombi, and placed in a performance temperature that was the same as the acclimation temperature (constant) or one of the other temperatures (mismatched). Prevalence of parasite transmission was checked 4 and 6 days post-parasite exposure, and infection intensity in the gut was quantified at 8 days post-exposure. Parasite strain, host colony, and host size had significant effects on transmission prevalence and infection load. However, neither transmission nor infection intensity were significantly different between constant and mismatched thermal regimes. Furthermore, acclimation temperature, performance temperature, and the interaction of acclimation and performance temperatures had no significant effects on infection outcomes. These results, counter to predictions of the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, suggest that infection outcomes in this host-parasite system are robust to thermal variation within typically experienced ranges. This could be a consequence of adaptation to commonly experienced natural thermal regimes or a result of individual and colony level heterothermy in bumble bees. However, thermal variability may still have a detrimental effect on more sensitive stages or species, or when extreme climatic events push temperatures outside of the normally experienced range.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1540-7063,1557-7023,,,,OCT,2019,59,4,,,,,1103,1113,,10.1093/icb/icz031,,,,,,,WOS:000491253900033,31065666,,,,

Spring nest establishment is a brief and vulnerable stage in the colony life cycle that is poorly understood. Bumble bee nesting activity in temperate North America has received little recent attention, and this knowledge gap is a barrier to conservation efforts. The aim of this study was to investigate the habitat use, nesting phenology, and key food plants of spring bumble bee queens. Through 108 nonlethal surveys of bumble bee queens in spring 2018, researchers observed 451 nest seeking and 555 foraging queens of nine species in Ohio, U.S.A. Spring queen activity began in mid-April and peaked in mid -May, although nest seekers were observed into late June. Nest seeking queens favored woody transitional habitats over open habitats. In accordance queen abundance and diversity increased with the proportion of forest in the surrounding landscape. The proportion of row crops and urban areas negatively influenced queen diversity and the number of nest seekers, respectively. Through a literature review, the earliest emergence dates for each species were compared for 12 datasets to establish an order of species emergence in northeastern North America. Fortyseven species of flowering plants were used by foraging queens.

Ground-nesting colonies of bumble bees incubate their brood at > 30 degrees C if floral forage provides sufficient energy and the thermogenic power of the colony can counteract cool soil conditions. To explore the basis of incubation, the thermogenic power and sugar consumption of orphaned nests of bumble bee workers (microcolonies) were investigated under laboratory conditions. 2. This study tested experimentally the effect of variation in worker number (ranging from four to 12 adults) on a microcolony's capacity to regulate brood temperature and recover from acute cold exposure. Microcolonies were provided with ad libitum sugar syrup and minimal insulation and maintained at an ambient temperature of c. 25 degrees C. Energy conversion efficiency was estimated by comparing sugar consumption with the power required for artificial incubation. The joint energetics of foraging and incubation were modelled in wild colonies to explore the effect of colony size and landscape quality on thermoregulation. 3. The results showed that all sizes of microcolonies regulated brood temperature at c. 31 degrees C under laboratory conditions, which required 96 mW of thermogenic power. It was estimated that individual workers of B. terrestris generated an incubatory power of 35 mW. The smallest microcolonies had the highest conversion efficiency (57%), apparently because few workers were required for incubation. 4. Modelling indicated that small microcolonies of three to seven adult workers have the capacity for normal brood incubation in the wild, but that the minimum viable colony size increases as floral forage becomes poorer or more distant. 5.

The waylaying effect of pollinators is often studied at a single spatial scale; to date, little is known about the best spatial extent at which waylaying effect of pollinators can be measured. In this study, we selected a landscape with mass-flowering tufted vetches to determine the spatial scale of waylaying effect of honey bees as well as the consequence of waylaying effect on vetch pollination service. The spatial scale of waylaying effect was determined by the strongest association between honey bee density and distance, selected from a gradient of nested circular buffers centering on apiaries in three different locations. Linear models were used to predict the influence of flower visitor densities on pollination service. For our landscape, honey bee densities were best associated with distances at spatial scales of 500 m, 1150 m, and 1400 m respectively for the three locations of apiaries. Honey bee was the only pollinator whose density displayed a positive relationship with pollination service. At the scales of effect, honey bee density and pollination service declined along the distance. Our findings suggest that the waylaying effect of pollinators needs to be examined at a specific spatial scale and farmers who use honey bees to pollinate their mass-flowering crops need to consider the spatial scale of waylaying effect of pollinators in order to maximize pollination service within agricultural ecosystems.",,,,,"Xie, Zhenghua/0000-0001-8407-4063",,,,,,,,,,,,1519-566X,1678-8052,,,,OCT,2019,48,5,,,,,717,728,,10.1007/s13744-019-00688-3,,,,,,,WOS:000483786600001,31062186,,,,

Each forager bee displays a tendency of loyalty toward specific plant species during the many daily foraging flights. Due to the ease of collection, pollen loads have been extensively used as a proxy for detection of pesticide residues. Pollen is the main protein food source for colonies, and its contamination has also been addressed as a reason for the colony losses phenomenon. As honeybees fly over a variable but wide range territory, they might collect pollen from both agricultural, urban and wild environments, also displaying considerable preferences in botanical sources between colonies of the same apiary. It is thus difficult to address the source of the pesticide contamination, when pollen is analyzed as a whole. In the current study, a practical and reliable approach has been proposed to narrow down the source of contamination. Pollen loads have been collected from colonies placed in eight locations over large apple orchard extensions in Trentino-South Tyrol region (Italy), during and 2 weeks after apple blossom. The pollen loads have been separated by the color due to the predominant plant species. On each color group, palynology and multi-residual chemical analyses have been performed in parallel. The pollen hazard quotient (PHQ) was used to estimate the risk to honeybees of each color group and of the total collected pollen. Apple and dandelion pollen were the main portions of the first collection, while a greater variety emerged after the apple blossom. Dandelion was always present in the samples. The frequency and the amount of pesticide residues differed according to the collection periods, the locations and the pollen color groups. The amount of insecticide residues increased after the apple blossom, while no difference between the period was found on fungicide residues. The PHQ values were higher after the blossom due to the insecticide contribution, with highest values of 160,000 and 150,000. The variations within samples did not allow to identify a unique source of contamination, whereas it seems that the pollen from plants outside the agricultural areas has as much residues as the pollen from apple orchards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-042X,,,,,Sep-18,2019,10,,,,,,,,1069,10.3389/fphys.2019.01069,,,,,,,WOS:000486413400001,31620006,,,,

Pollinator shifts rather than cospeciation dominate the evolutionary history of South African Rediviva bees and their Diascia host plants,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Plant-pollinator interactions are often highly specialised, which may be a consequence of co-evolution. Yet when plants and pollinators co-evolve, it is not clear if this will also result in frequent cospeciation. Here, we investigate the mutual evolutionary history of South African oil-collecting Rediviva bees and their Diascia host plants, in which the elongated forelegs of female Rediviva have been suggested to coevolve with the oil-producing spurs of their Diascia hosts. After controlling for phylogenetic nonindependence, we found Rediviva foreleg length to be significantly correlated with Diascia spur length, suggestive of co-evolution. However, as trait correlation could also be due to pollinator shifts, we tested if cospeciation or pollinator shifts have dominated the evolution of Rediviva-Diascia interactions by analysing phylogenies in a cophylogenetic framework. Distance-based cophylogenetic analyses (PARAFIT, PACo) indicated significant congruence of the two phylogenies under most conditions. Yet, we found that phylogenetic relatedness was correlated with ecological similarity (the spectrum of partners that each taxon interacted with) only for Diascia but not for Rediviva, suggesting that phylogenetic congruence might be due to phylogenetic tracking by Diascia of Rediviva rather than strict (reciprocal) co-evolution. Furthermore, event-based reconciliation using a parsimony approach (CORE-PA) on average revealed only 11-13 cospeciation events but 58-80 pollinator shifts. Probabilistic cophylogenetic analyses (COALA) supported this trend (8-29 cospeciations vs. 40 pollinator shifts). Our study suggests that diversification of Diascia has been largely driven by Rediviva (phylogenetic tracking, pollinator shifts) but not vice versa.

Jumping spiders (Araneae: Salticidae) are characterized by their highly acute vision, which mediates many behaviors, including prey capture and navigation. When moving to a specific goal (prey, nest, a potential mate, etc.), salticids rely on visual cues and spatial memory to orient in 3-dimensional space. Salticid spatial ability has been studied in homing and detour tasks, with Portia being considered one of the most skillful genera in terms of spatial ability in the family. Commonly living in complex environments, salticids are likely to encounter a wide variety of routes that could lead to a goal, and, as selection favors individuals that can accurately make assessments, they may be able to assess alternative route distances to select the most efficient route. Here, we tested whether 2 salticid species (Portia fimbriata and Trite planiceps) can discriminate and assess between different available routes by their length, and riskiness to escape from a stressful scenario. Results suggest that while Portia is more likely to choose the easiest and shortest escape routes, Trite is faster in both decision making about which route to take, and to escape. However, some individuals were able to use novel shortcuts instead of the routes expected, with Portia containing a higher proportion of shortcut-takers than Trite.

While land use intensification has resulted in steep declines of wild bee diversity across agricultural landscapes, the creation of semi-natural habitats has been proposed as a counter-measure. However, the relative value of semi-natural and natural habitats in promoting wild bees has rarely been studied, especially for China that harbors the world's largest plantation forest area, characterized by intensively managed, mono-dominant stands of wind-pollinated tree species. We sampled wild bees in apple orchards to assess how their assemblages were influenced by semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape and the local flowering ground-cover. Bee abundance declined with increasing isolation from natural shrubland. In contrast, wild bee diversity and abundance were negatively linked to plantation forests. For the abundance of large bees, this effect was partly ameliorated by local flowering groundcover. Maintaining or restoring wild bee assemblages in agricultural landscapes therefore requires careful evaluations of restoration measures such as forest planting.

These challenges can give rise to recognition mechanisms that adaptively integrate information across multiple sensory modalities. The valley carpenter bee, Xylocopa varipuncta, nests in dead wood in large aggregations of up to several dozen nests. This study investigates the proximate mechanisms by which returning foragers quickly and reliably identify their own nest entrance within a high-density nesting site. We manipulated long- and short-range visual cues associated with nest entrances, removed chemical cues on the inside of nest entrances and added chemical cues from foreign conspecific bees. By measuring the effect of these manipulations on nest search time and search accuracy, we assessed the importance of visual and olfactory sensory modalities in allowing carpenter bees to locate their nests within aggregations. Our results support the hypothesis that both visual and olfactory cues can facilitate nest localization. Removal of nest olfactory cues did not significantly disrupt homing, suggesting that olfactory information may not be necessary for nest localization when visual information is available. However, the addition of olfactory cues from unfamiliar conspecific bees actually aided nest localization rather than disrupting it, suggesting that bees may use generalized species odour cues for homing. Due to intense nest site competition within aggregations, nest localization may have important social implications for maintenance of high-density nesting.

To further comprehend this aspect of the reproductive process, data regarding pollen transport and deposition patterns need to be gathered and analyzed. The aim of this study was to examine pollen flow dynamics in a population of the Xylocopa bee-pollinated Passiflora caerulea using fluorescent powdered dyes as pollen mimics and to analyze the relationship between inter-plant distance and fruit production. Plant arrangement, number of flowers per plant, pollen flow and fruit set exhibited leptokurtic distributions as a function of the distance between plants. Minimum and maximum dispersal distances were 4 m and 257 m, respectively. Geitonogamous transfers were more frequent than xenogamous ones. Pollinator movements, evidenced by pollen analogues transferences, responded to plant arrangement. Centris sp. was recorded for the first time as a pollinator of Passiflora caerulea.

By using experimental plots of Brassica rapa plants infested with generalist (Mamestra brassicae) and specialised (Pieris brassicae) native herbivores and with a generalist invasive (Spodoptera littoralis) herbivore, we estimated both pollen movement among treatments and the visiting behaviour of honeybees versus other wild pollinators. Overall, we found that herbivory has weak effects on plant pollen export, either in terms of inter-treatment movements or of dispersion distance. Plants infested with the native specialised herbivore tend to export less pollen to other plants with the same treatment. Other wild pollinators preferentially visit non-infested plants that differ from those of honeybees, which showed no preferences. Honeybees and other wild pollinators also showed different behaviours on plants infested with different herbivores, with the former tending to avoid revisiting the same treatment and the latter showing no avoidance behaviour. When taking into account the whole pollinator community, i.e. the interactive effects of honeybees and other wild pollinators, we found an increased avoidance of plants infested by the native specialised herbivore and a decreased avoidance of plants infested by the invasive herbivore.

As legislative reassessment of neonicotinoid use occurs globally, there is an urgent need to understand the potential risk of other systemic insecticides. Sulfoxaflor, the first branded sulfoximine-based insecticide, has the same mode of action as neonicotinoids, and may potentially replace them over large geographical ranges. Here we assessed the impact of acute sulfoxaflor exposure on performance in two paradigms that have previously been used to illustrate negative impacts of neonicotinoid pesticides on bee learning and memory. We assayed whether acute sulfoxaflor exposure influences (a) olfactory conditioning performance in both bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and honeybees (Apis mellifera), using a proboscis extension reflex assay, and (b) working memory performance of bumblebees, using a radial-arm maze.

Thus far, most research assessing the combined effects of farming systems and landscape complexity on beneficial insects has been conducted in relatively diversified and mesic systems and may not represent the large-scale, monoculture-based dryland agriculture that dominates many regions worldwide. Specifically, the effects of farming systems on forbs, bees, and their interactions are poorly understood in highly simplified dryland landscapes such as those in the Northern Great Plains, United States, an area globally important for conventional and organic small grain, pulse, forage, and oilseed production. During a 3-yr (2013-2015) study, we assessed 1) the effects of dryland no-till conventional and tilled organic farming on forbs, bees, and bee- flower networks and 2) the relationship between natural habitat and bee abundance. Flower density and richness were greater in tilled organic fields than in no-till conventional fields, and forb community composition differed between farming systems. We observed high bee diversity (109 taxa) in this highly simplified landscape, and bee abundance, richness, and community composition were similar between systems. Compared with tilled organic fields, bee-flower interactions in no-till conventional fields were poorly connected, suggesting these systems maintain relatively impoverished plant-pollinator networks. Natural habitat (11% of the landscape) did not affect small-bodied bee abundance in either farming system but positively affected large-bodied bees within 2,000 m of crop-field centers. In highly simplified agricultural landscapes, dryland organic farming and no-till conventional farming together support relatively high bee diversity, presumably because dryland organic farming enhances floral resources and bee-flower networks, and no-till management in conventional farming provides undisturbed ground-nesting habitats for wild bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea).",,,,,"Adhikari, Subodh/0000-0002-4920-6814",,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,1938-2936,,,,AUG,2019,48,4,,,,,826,835,,10.1093/ee/nvz056,,,,,,,WOS:000493086500007,31144714,,,,

It is unknown how these changes have affected the native bee community. We surveyed the bee communities in relatively intact native prairie at two National Wildlife Refuges in Texas, quantifying bee community structure as a function of the presence/absence of grazing by prairie dogs.

Bee diversity differed between sites on and off prairie dog colonies, but in trends that differed by refuge and by index, suggesting that location was more important than prairie dog presence.These results represent a reference fauna against which other regional bee communities in other land-cover types can be compared, but the high spatial heterogeneity we found indicates that detecting effects of landscape change on native bees will be challenging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,1938-2936,,,,AUG,2019,48,4,,,,,968,976,,10.1093/ee/nvz063,,,,,,,WOS:000493086500022,31115445,,,,

The assessment of the diet of the stingless bee Melipona orbignyi was carried out by comparing different calculations from palynological data being the index of relative importance (IRI) the most complete, objective, and here recommended. This index showed that the order of the four most important pollen resources was Prosopis (IRI = 3354), Albizia inundata (1999), Cynophalla retusa (921), and Solanum type 2 (693), and the value of importance of species (SI) calculated for honey resources showed that they were type Maytenus (SI = 20.79), Prosopis (18.73), Cynophalla retusa (6.72), and Ziziphus mistol (3.32). Three flower types predominated in pollen and nectar provisions: brush flowers, solanoid flowers with poricidal anthers, and generalized small pale flowers, being the former two associated to buzzing. The abundance of the nectarless Solanum in honey samples is discussed. Good forest management practices for pollinator conservation native to the Chaco forest should include the keeping of undisturbed forest patches for nesting and foraging while the surrounding forest resources are managed in a sustainable way. Furthermore, because some threatened plants important for the M. orbignyi diet require gene flow to maintain healthy populations, short distances among the forest patches are needed, a fact that also helps to avoid genetic drift in Melipona colonies.

Ninety-seven vetch patches with independent gradients of size and distances to nesting sites were selected from 11 agricultural landscapes with independent gradients of surrounding semi-natural habitats and nesting resources. Semi-natural habitats and nesting resources were quantified either by field inspections or from satellite images; flower visitor densities and vetch pollination services were measured across overall flowering seasons. The proportion of semi-natural habitats did not modify the concentration effect or waylaying effect of the abundant and highly social honey bees or the solitary species Anthophora waltoni. The increase in area of brick walls, acting as nesting resources of A. waltoni, increased the concentration effect and the waylaying effect. For other solitary bees, the proportion of semi-natural habitats and the proportion of buildings did not influence the concentration effect or the waylaying effect. Honey bee density, A. waltoni density and other solitary bee density positively predict vetch pollination services.

We first investigated whether bees could learn to adjust their sonication frequency in response to pollen rewards given only for specified frequency ranges and found no evidence of instrumental learning. However, we found that absence versus receipt of a pollen reward did lead to a predictable behavioral response, which depended on bee size. Finally, we found some evidence of mechanical constraints, in that flower mass affected sonication acceleration (but not frequency) through an interaction with bee size. In general, larger bees showed more flexibility in sonication frequency and acceleration, potentially reflecting a size-based constraint on the range over which smaller bees can modify frequency and acceleration.

These colors have been proposed to act as signals for plant-insect communication. However, there is a paucity of behavioral data to allow for interpretations of how to classify these colors either as a signal or a cue when considering the natural conditions under which pollination occurs. We sampled flowers from 6 plant species across various viewpoints looking for changes in the visual appearance of the petals. Spectral characteristics were measured with different instruments to simulate both the spectral and spatial characteristics of honeybee's vision. We show the presence of color patches produced by angle dependent effects on the petals and the calyx of various species; however, the appearance of the angle dependent color patches significantly varies with viewpoint and would only be resolved by the insect eye at close distances. Behavior experiments with honeybees revealed that pollinators did not use angle dependent colors to drive behavior when presented with novel flower presentations. Results show that angle dependent colors do not comply with the requirements of a signal for plant-pollinator communication since the information transmitted by these colors would be unreliable for potential, free-flying pollination vectors. We thus classify angle dependent colors produced by micro-and ultra-structures as being a cue (a feature which has not evolved for communication), and observe no evidence supporting claims of these angle dependent colors having evolved as visual signal.",,,,"Shrestha, Mani/P-7045-2015","Shrestha, Mani/0000-0002-6165-8418",,,,,,,,,,,,1674-5507,2396-9814,,,,AUG,2019,65,4,,,,,467,481,,10.1093/cz/zoy096,,,,,,,WOS:000480380600013,31413719,,,,

Flies are known to have a complex visual system, including 4 spectral classes of photoreceptors that contribute to the perception of color. Our current understanding of how color signals are perceived by flies is based on data for the blowfly Lucilia sp., which after being conditioned to rewarded monochromatic light stimuli, showed evidence of a categorical color visual system. The resulting opponent fly color space has 4 distinct categories, and has been used to interpret how some fly pollinators may perceive flower colors. However, formal proof that flower flies (Syrphidae) only use a simple, categorical color process remains outstanding. In free-flying experiments, we tested the hoverfly Eristalis tenax, a Batesian mimic of the honeybee, that receives its nutrition by visiting flowers. Using a range of broadband similar-dissimilar color stimuli previously used to test color perception in pollinating hymenopteran species, we evaluated if there are steep changes in behavioral choices with continuously increasing color differences as might be expected by categorical color processing. Our data revealed that color choices by the hoverfly are mediated by a continuous monotonic function. Thus, these flies did not use a categorical processing, but showed evidence of a color discrimination function similar to that observed in several bee species. We therefore empirically provide data for the minimum color distance that can be discriminated by hoverflies in fly color space, enabling an improved understanding of plant-pollinator interactions with a non-model insect species.",,,,,"Burd, Martin/0000-0002-1175-2596",,,,,,,,,,,,1674-5507,2396-9814,,,,AUG,2019,65,4,,,,,483,492,,10.1093/cz/zoz008,,,,,,,WOS:000480380600014,31413720,,,,

However, the effects of organic farming on honeybees remain elusive, despite honeybees' importance as pollinators of crops and wild plants. Using 6 years of data from a large-scale study with fortnightly measurements of honeybee colony performance traits (10 apiaries per year distributed across a 435 km(2)-large research site in France), we related worker brood area, number of adult bees and honey reserves to the proportions of organic farmland in the surroundings of the hives at two spatial scales (300 m and 1,500 m). We found evidence that, at the local scale, organic farming increased both worker brood production and number of adult bees in the period of flower scarcity between the blooms of oilseed rape and sunflower (hereafter 'dearth period'). At the landscape scale, organic farming increased honey reserves during the dearth period and at the beginning of the sunflower bloom. The results suggest that worker brood development benefitted from organic farming mostly through a more diverse diet due to an increase in the availability of diverse pollen sources in close proximity of their hives. Reduced pesticide drift may have additionally improved bee survival. Honey reserves were possibly mostly affected by increased availability of melliferous flowers in foraging distance. Synthesis and applications. Organic farming increases honeybee colony performance in a period of resource scarcity, likely through a continuous supply of floral resources including weeds, cover crops and semi-natural elements. We demonstrate how worker brood area increases in the critical dearth period (between the blooms of oilseed rape and sunflower). This has previously been linked to winter colony survival, suggesting that organic farmland may mitigate repercussions of intensive farming on colony vitality.

In the simplest model, we assume that the angle between flight direction and the nest direction as seen from the position of the insect is constant and only flips sign when pivoting direction around the nest is changed, resulting in a concatenation of piecewise defined logarithmic spirals. We then added characteristic properties of real learning flights, such as head saccades and the condition that the nest entrance within the visual field is kept nearly constant to describe the development of a learning flight in a head-centered frame of reference, assuming that the retinal position of the nest is known. We finally implemented a closed-loop simulation of learning flights based on a small set of visual control rules. The visual input for this model are rendered views generated from 3D reconstructions of natural wasp nesting sites, and the retinal nest position is controlled by means of simple template-based tracking. We show that naturalistic paths can be generated without knowledge of the absolute distance to the nest or of the flight speed.

We have reviewed the scientific evidence on risk factors associated with managed colonies of B. terrestris in Europe, and we highlight the strengths, weaknesses and gaps in the current knowledge base. In contrast to other reports, we conclude that there is currently not enough reliable, consistent evidence to support claims that the current use of managed B. terrestris in Europe is harmful to wild populations of B. terrestris and other bumble bees, and therefore the issue remains unresolved. In the case of disease risks in particular, there is conflicting evidence published by some researchers on the prevalence of pathogens in managed colonies versus audited data published by one of the main bumble bee producers. The current lack of consistent evidence makes it difficult for government regulators to make informed risk assessments, and we argue that more work is needed to demonstrate both the reproducibility of published findings and to understand the mechanisms of action of risk effects.

For one, much of the ecological research has assumed that the environment changes in a linear fashion from the city core to the city edges, whereas in reality the environments within the cities are highly heterogeneous. Furthermore, studies on species responses to these highly variable ecosystems are often based on interspecific mean trait values, which ignore the potential for high levels of intraspecific variation among individuals in key functional traits. The current study investigated intraspecific functional trait differences for four functional traits associated with body size, mobility and resource selection among rural and urban populations of two common bumblebee species, Bombus pascuorum and Bombus lapidarius, in urban centres and adjacent rural areas in Switzerland. We document shifts in functional traits towards smaller individuals and higher multidimensional trait variation in urban populations compared to rural conspecifics of both species. This shows that urban individuals for both species are on average smaller sized but populations are distinctively different from rural population by increasing their trait richness and diversifying their trait combinations. In addition, we found bimodality in tongue length within urban B. pascuorum populations. Our results suggest that urban and rural populations possibly experience differential selection pressures resulting in trait differences across and among populations.

Such local endemics are in need of special conservation efforts because of the increasing anthropogenic pressure and climate changes. Here, we re-examine the taxonomic and biogeographic affinities of bumble bees from Novaya Zemlya using historical samples and recently collected materials (1895-1925 vs. 2015-2017). Three bumble bee species inhabit the Yuzhny (Southern) Island and the southern edge of Severny (Northern) Island of this archipelago: Bombus glacialis Friese, 1902, B. hyperboreus Schonherr, 1809, and B. pyrrhopygus Friese, 1902. Bombus glacialis shares three unique COI haplotypes that may indicate its long-term (pre-glacial) persistence on Novaya Zemlya. In contrast, Bombus hyperboreus and B. pyrrhopygus share a rather low molecular divergence from mainland populations, with the same or closely related haplotypes as those from Arctic Siberia and Norway. A brief re-description of Bombus pyrrhopygus based on the newly collected topotypes is presented. Habitats, foraging plants and life cycles of bumble bees on Novaya Zemlya are characterized, and possible causes of extremely low bumble bee abundance on the archipelago are discussed. The species-poor bumble bee fauna of Novaya Zemlya is compared with those in other areas throughout the Arctic. The mean bumble bee species richness on the Arctic Ocean islands is three times lower than that in the mainland Arctic areas (3.1 vs. 8.6 species per local fauna, respectively). General linear models (GLMs) indicate that this difference can be explained by specific environmental conditions of insular areas.

Several mathematical models have been put forward as energetically optimal foraging strategies when the food environment is sparse (i.e., the distance between food patches in the environment is much larger than the distance from which the forager can perceive food). In particular, Levy walks with a power law exponent approaching 1 are considered optimal for destructive foragers. However, these models have yet to explore the role of sensory perception in foraging success as the distance between food patches approaches the distance from which the forager can perceive food. Here, we used an agent-based modeling approach to address this question. Our results concur that lower values of the power law exponent (i.e. values approaching 1) result in the most food found, but in contrast to previous studies, we note that, in many cases, lower exponents are not optimal when we consider food found per unit distance traveled. For example, higher values of the exponent resulted in comparable or higher foraging success relative to lower values when the forager's range of sensory perception was restricted to an angle 30 from its current heading. In addition, we find that sensory perception has a larger effect on foraging success than the power law exponent. These results suggest that a deeper examination of how animals perceive food sources from a distance may affect longstanding assumptions regarding the optimality of Levy walk foraging patterns, and lend support to the developing theoretical shift towards models that place increasing emphasis on how organisms interact with their environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0304-3800,1872-7026,,,,Jul-24,2019,404,,,,,,69,82,,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.02.015,,,,,,,WOS:000471208900008,,,,,

To reverse these effects, flowering habitat enhancements are designed to provide supplemental nutritional resources for wild bees and are particularly important when few resources are available in the surrounding landscape. Yet, it is not known whether or how habitat enhancements support bee populations under varying landscape contexts. Body size is a morphological trait that is strongly linked to foraging ability, immune function, and fitness in bees. Landscape simplification has been associated with size declines across bee taxa and smaller body size can be an early indicator of environmental stress. To determine whether the negative effects of landscape simplification on body size can be improved by adding floral resources to farm landscapes, we measured the body size of 10 wild bee species collected at 70 sites with or without habitat enhancements in Michigan and New York. Bees were collected at sites with varying amounts of agriculture in the surrounding landscape, allowing us to test whether morphological responses to enhancements are affected by landscape simplification. Half of the bee species measured exhibited declining body size across the landscape gradient. Among these species, declines were buffered by the presence of habitat enhancements suggesting this response is the result of improved nutrition, reduced need for long-distance foraging, enhanced recruitment of larger individuals or a combination of these mechanisms. Declines in body size were strongest in both the smallest and the largest species. Large and medium sized species exhibited the greatest response to flowering habitat enhancements. Synthesis and applications. At sites with high agricultural cover, we observed intraspecific body size declines among many species; however, we did not observe decreased body size in any species at sites with a flowering habitat enhancement.

In two of the three localities studied, burned areas, including areas that burned with high-severity wildfires, supported higher density and diversity of native bees and the flowers they depend on for food and larval provisioning. Burned areas also had more bare ground for ground-nesting bees and more available coarse woody debris for cavity-nesting bees than unburned areas. Moreover, cavity-nesting bees were completely unsuccessful at nesting in artificial nesting boxes in unburned areas, while nesting success was 40% in burned areas. Mean bee intertegular distance (a trait strongly correlated with tongue length, foraging distance, and body size) was similar between burned and unburned areas. However, wildfires influenced both interspecific and intraspecific trait variation of bees and plants. Intraspecific variation in bee intertegular distance was higher in unburned than burned areas. Both interspecific and intraspecific variation in floral traits important for interactions with pollinators were generally higher in burned than unburned areas. Thus, wildfires generally increased the density and species diversity of bees and flowers as well as trait variation at both trophic levels.

Our study characterizes and quantifies the phenology of nectar resources at the whole-farm scale on replicate farms in Southwestern UK throughout the flowering season. We quantify the corresponding nectar demands of a subset of common wild pollinators (bumblebees) to compare nectar supply and pollinator demand throughout the year, thereby identifying periods of supply-demand deficit.

March and August/September are also periods of low nectar availability. Comparing the phenology of nectar supply with the phenology of bumblebee nectar demand reveals ""hunger gaps"" during March and much of August/September when supply is unlikely to meet demand. Permanent pasture and woodland produced the greatest share of farmland nectar because of their large area; however, linear features such as hedgerows and field margins provided the greatest nectar per unit area. Fifty percent of total nectar was supplied by just three species (Allium ursinum, Cirsium arvense and Trifolium repens), but some less productive species (e.g. Hedera helix and Taraxacum agg.) were important in ensuring phenological continuity of nectar supply. Synthesis and applications. By comparing the phenology of farmland nectar supply with the phenology of pollinator demand, we demonstrate that the timing of nectar supply may be as important as total nectar production in limiting farmland pollinator populations. Considering phenology in the design of agri-environment or restoration schemes is therefore likely to improve their suitability for pollinators. Plant species which flower during periods of resource deficit (early spring and late summer) should be prioritized in schemes which aim to conserve or restore pollinator populations. Maintaining a range of semi-natural habitats with complementary flowering phenologies (e.g. woodland, hedgerows and field margins) will ensure a more continuous supply of nectar on farmland, thereby supporting pollinators for their entire flight season.",,,,"Timberlake, Thomas/AAD-1398-2020; Vaughan, Ian/A-4782-2010","Timberlake, Thomas/0000-0001-8166-0825; Vaughan, Ian/0000-0002-7263-3822",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,JUL,2019,56,7,,,,,1585,1596,,10.1111/1365-2664.13403,,,,,,,WOS:000474270200008,,,,,

Because a mature seed is needed before a gene flow event can occur, pollen viability will influence the risk of escape for genetically engineered (GE) crops. Pollen viability was measured at intervals for up to 2 h following removal of the pollen from the anthers. It was quantified at three temperatures and for different alfalfa varieties, including both conventional and Roundup Ready (RR) varieties. Pollen viability was assessed using in vitro germination. Time since removal from the anthers was the most prevalent factor affecting pollen viability in alfalfa. Pollen viability declined with increasing time at all three temperatures and for all varieties tested. Pollen viability was not affected by temperatures ranging between 25 and 37 degrees C and did not vary among plant varieties, including conventional and RR varieties. Bee foraging behaviour suggested pollen viability within the first 10 min following pollen removal from a flower to most affect seed production. Pollen longevity was predicted to have little impact on seed set and gene flow.

However, data on the integrated residue and spatial-temporal variation of neonicotinoids from noncrop plants, the principle sources of pollen for honey bees, are very limited, especially in China. In this study, we employed a novel assessment method based on the relative potency factor to calculate the integrated residue of seven neonicotinoids in pollen and honey samples collected from noncrop plants in 12 stations of Zhejiang province in three consecutive months. The integrated concentration of neonicotinoids (IMIRPF) ranged from no detected (ND) to 34.93 ng/g in pollen and ND to 8.51 ng/g in honey. Acetamiprid showed the highest detection frequency of 41.7%, followed by clothianidin (33.3%) and dinotefuran (22.2%). The highest IMIRPF occurred in April for stations in the fringe areas of Zhejiang province, whereas for stations in the central areas of Zhejiang province, the IMIRPF in May was relatively higher than the other two months. In terms of spatial change, the pollution variation of pollen samples in Lin'an-Tonglu-Pujiang was relative highly polluted-lightly polluted-highly polluted. For honey samples, spatial variation showed a single trend, and peak values were found in Wenzhou, which may be attributed to the local climate and farming practices.

Cluster analysis was performed to assess similarity in botanical composition between pot-pollen and pot-honey provisions from different colonies. The results indicated that each colony was capable to access to different plant species for obtaining nectar and pollen, a fact observed when discarding the contaminated honey samples. As honey samples were not clustered together with other ones but with pollen samples indicating a similar botanical composition, it could be assumed that a same plant species provided nectar and pollen to bees.

Melittidae were not included although they are important pollinators in South Africa where they comprise an especially rich and morphologically diverse fauna. We measured intertegular distance (correlated with body size) and proboscis length of 179 specimens of 11 species from three genera of Melittidae. With the inclusion of Melittidae, we tested the between family differences in the allometric scaling coefficients. AIC model selection was used to establish which factors provide the best estimate of proboscis length. We explored a hypothesis that has been proposed in the literature, but which has not been tested, whereby body and range sizes of bees are correlated with rainfall regions. We tested this by using body size measurements of 2109 museum specimens from 56 species of Melittidae and applied the model coefficients to estimate proboscis length and foraging distance. Our results from testing differences across bee families show that with the addition of Melittidae, we retained the overall pattern of significant differences in the scaling coefficient among Apoidea, with our model explaining 98% of the variance in species-level means for proboscis length. When testing the relationship between body size and rainfall region we found no relationship for South African Melittidae.

When the synchrony of flowering and pollinator emergence is disturbed by climate change, seed production may be restricted due to insufficient pollination success. We revealed the mechanism of phenological mismatch between a spring ephemeral (Corydalis ambigua) and its pollinator (overwintered bumblebees), and its impact on plant reproduction, based on 19 years of monitoring and a snow removal experiment in a cool-temperate forest in northern Japan. Early snowmelt increased the risk of phenological mismatch under natural conditions. Seed production was limited by pollination success over the 3 years of the pollination experiment and decreased when flowering occurred prior to bee emergence. Similar trends were detected on modification of flowering phenology through snow removal. Following snowmelt, the length of the pre-flowering period strongly depended on the ambient surface temperature, ranging from 4 days (at greater than 7 degrees C) to 26 days (at 2.5 degrees C). Flowering onset was explained with an accumulated surface degree-day model. Bumblebees emerged when soil temperature reached 6 degrees C, which was predictable by an accumulated soil degree-day model, although foraging activity after emergence might depend on air temperature. These results indicate that phenological mismatch tends to occur when snow melts early but subsequent soil warming progresses slowly. Thus, modification of the snowmelt regime could be a major driver disturbing spring phenology in northern ecosystems.",,,,"Kudo, Gaku/A-2733-2015","Kudo, Gaku/0000-0002-6488-818X",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,Jun-04,2019,286,1904,,,,,,,20190573,10.1098/rspb.2019.0573,,,,,,,WOS:000472023000027,31185863,,,,

One explanation as to why some species have declined, based primarily on studies of the European bumble bee fauna, is that declining species have relatively narrow pollen-foraging niches and are less able to use alternative host plants in the absence of their preferred hosts. Though extensively explored in Europe, this hypothesis has not been investigated in North America, in part due to incomplete information on the foraging niche of many species. We selected 12 bumble bee species found in Michigan and quantified their pollen diets using museum specimens. We also extensively resurveyed the state to understand their contemporary status and distribution. Compared to a pre-2000 baseline, six species remain relatively common and widespread, whereas six species show range contractions of over 50%. There was a significant relationship between dietary breadth and distributional range change, with declined or declining species collecting around one-third fewer pollen types than stable species. Though there were significant compositional differences, we found no differences in the number of pollen types collected by species with differing tongue lengths. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that species with narrower dietary niches are at greater risk of decline. However, it is not clear if narrow dietary niches are a cause of declines, or if both are driven by an underlying factor such as proximity to the edge of climatic niches. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of dietary niche in bumble bees, and how it interacts with other factors to influence population trajectories of stable and at-risk species.",,,,"Wood, Thomas/I-7025-2019; Isaacs, Rufus/AAF-4646-2019; Gibbs, Jason/B-9353-2018","Wood, Thomas/0000-0001-5653-224X; Isaacs, Rufus/0000-0001-7523-4643; Graham, Kelsey/0000-0001-9445-0202; Gibbs, Jason/0000-0002-4945-5423",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,JUN,2019,100,6,,,,,,,UNSP e02697,10.1002/ecy.2697,,,,,,,WOS:000474127300004,31012965,,,,

Landscape genomics offers powerful tools to assess the influence of landscape modifications on genetic diversity and functional connectivity, and to identify adaptations to local environmental conditions that could facilitate future bee survival. Here, we assessed range-wide patterns of genetic structure, genetic diversity, gene flow, and local adaptation in the stingless bee Melipona subnitida, a tropical pollinator of key biological and economic importance inhabiting one of the driest and hottest regions of South America. Our results reveal four genetic clusters across the species' full distribution range. All populations were found to be under a mutation-drift equilibrium, and genetic diversity was not influenced by the amount of reminiscent natural habitats. However, genetic relatedness was spatially autocorrelated and isolation by landscape resistance explained range-wide relatedness patterns better than isolation by geographic distance, contradicting earlier findings for stingless bees. Specifically, gene flow was enhanced by increased thermal stability, higher forest cover, lower elevations, and less corrugated terrains. Finally, we detected genomic signatures of adaptation to temperature, precipitation, and forest cover, spatially distributed in latitudinal and altitudinal patterns. Taken together, our findings shed important light on the life history of M. subnitida and highlight the role of regions with large thermal fluctuations, deforested areas, and mountain ranges as dispersal barriers.

This finding demonstrates that transposing flight navigation information to dance information is not a reflexive behavior. Furthermore, many bees showed intermediate dance durations during the update process, indicating that honey bees highly likely use two memories: (i) a recently acquired navigation experience and (ii) a previously stored flight experience. Double-shift experiments, in which the feeder was moved forward and backward, created an experimental condition in which honey bee foragers did not update dance duration; suggesting the involvement of more complex memory processes. Our behavioral paradigm allows the dissociation of foraging and dance activity and opens the possibility of studying the molecular and neural processes underlying the waggle dance behavior.",,,,"George, Ebi Antony/V-9106-2019","George, Ebi Antony/0000-0002-5533-5428; Brockmann, Axel/0000-0003-0201-9656",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JUN,2019,222,11,,,,,,,UNSP jeb195099,10.1242/jeb.195099,,,,,,,WOS:000472716500011,31097604,,,,

For many decades, ingenious and probing behavioural experiments have been the only window onto the operation of path integration in arthropods. New methods have now made it possible to visualise the activity of neural circuits in Drosophila while they fly or walk in virtual reality. Studies of this kind, as well as electrophysiological recordings from single neurons in the brains of other insects, are revealing details of the neural mechanisms that control an insect's direction of travel and other aspects of path integration. The aim here is first to review the major features of path integration in foraging desert ants and honeybees, the current champion path integrators of the insect world, and second consider how the elaborate behaviour of these insects might be accommodated within the framework of the newly understood neural circuits. The discussion focuses particularly on the ability of ants and honeybees to use a celestial compass to give direction in Earth-based coordinates, and of honeybees to use a landscape panorama to provide directional guidance for path integration.

This is evident from their extremely generalist foraging and adeptness at handling diverse flower types as legitimate pollinators and as illegitimate nectar robbers. They purportedly use traplining to forage between isolated patches and are long-distance flyers over several kilometres suggesting well-developed spatial learning, route memory and navigational capabilities. They have a broad range of temperature tolerance and thermoregulatory capabilities which are likely employed in their forays into crepuscular and nocturnal time periods.

We assessed species richness, abundance, and the diversity of wild bees in wastelands that differed in area (2-35ha), stage of ecological succession, location (suburbs or closer to the city centre), and history of land use. In the investigated plots, we recorded 42% of all bee species reported from Poland. The attractiveness of wastelands was positively correlated with the coverage of blooming herbs, coverage of shrubs and low trees, and the area of the wasteland. An increase in isolation of the habitat patches, the percentage contribution of alien species, annuals, and low grasses (<25 cm) negatively affected the diversity of Apiformes. Considering the history of land use, we found that the bees were most attracted to wastelands resulting from extractive industry (sand and clay pits), and grassy habitats located in the suburbs, e.g. at sites grazed earlier by sheep. Wastelands in areas directly influenced by the chemical industry were the least attractive to bees. Analyses of quantitative and qualitative similarity of bees in various habitat types showed that three habitat types were the most similar to grasslands in the suburbs (the least disturbed habitats): degraded grasslands located closer to the city centre, extraction pits, and old fields.

The proposed CB-ABC focuses on the kind of information in the belief space that should be stored to reduce promising solutions' area. Moreover, CB-ABC divides the population into two groups of individuals, one group updates by the heritage of best previous solutions and the other group updates by self-adaptive information. The performance of the new algorithm has been validated on a variety of numerical testbench functions (ranging from CEC 2005 and CEC 2017) and compared to standard ABC and other variants named ABCM, HPA and CABCA as well. The proposed algorithm proves its success as well when applied on Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to locate them accurately. To validate the performance of CB-ABC it is compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Cuckoo Search (CS), Firefly Algorithm (FA) and Parallel Firefly Algorithm (PFA). CB-ABC shows the least average error value compared to the standard ABC as well as the other algorithms previously mentioned in the comparison. Moreover, CB-ABC succeeds in reducing the number of iterations as well as function evaluations to 17% of those of the standard ABC to 20% of those obtained by ABCM during solving WSN localization problem.

One of the possible remaining paths led through Antarctica, that was not yet glaciated and it remained habitable for many organisms. This favourable climate made Antarctica an important migration corridor for organisms with good dispersal ability, such as Aculeata (Hymenoptera), fill the Oligocene cooling. Here we tested how cooling of Antarctica impacted global dispersal of Aculeata parasites (Strepsiptera: Xenidae). Our data set comprising six nuclear genes from a broad sample of Xenidae. Bayesian dating was used to estimate divergence times in phylogenetic reconstruction. Biogeography was investigated using event-based analytical methods: likelihood-based dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis and Bayesian models. The Bayesian model was used for reconstruction of ancestral host groups. Biogeographical methods indicate that multiple lineages were exchanged between the New World and the Old World + Australia until the Antarctica became completely frozen over. During the late Paleogene and Neogene periods, several lineages spread from the Afrotropics to other Old World regions and Australia. The original hosts of Xenidae were most likely social wasps. Within one lineage of solitary wasp parasites, parallel switch to digger wasps (Sphecidae) occurred independently in the New World and Old World regions. The biogeography and macroevolutionary history of Xenidae can be explained by the combination of dispersal, lineage extinction and climatic changes during the Cenozoic era. A habitable Antarctica and the presence of now-submerged islands and plateaus that acted as a connection between the New World and Old World + Australia provided the possibility for biotic exchanges of parasites along with their hymenopteran hosts. Although Xenidae are generally host specialists, there were significant host switches to unrelated but ecologically similar hosts during their evolution.

However, the basic ABC only evolves one colony and both the employed bee phase and onlooker phase utilize the same solution search equation, which performs well in exploration but poorly in exploitation. Inspired by the good working efficiency of labor division and the coordination of complementary elements, we propose a novel individual dependent multi-colony ABC algorithm, abbreviated as IDABC, in which the whole colony is divided into three sub-colonies, i.e., inferior sub-colony, mid sub-colony and superior sub-colony, based on the fitness function values of the individuals involved. Three evolution operators with different searching biases are introduced into the corresponding sub-colonies in order to play different roles. Furthermore, we improve the related evolution operators by incorporating the fitness and distance information of individuals and the control parameters involved in the food source perturbation that are dynamically adjusted according to the search experience. And an orthogonal learning mechanism is suggested for scout bee searching so as to generate potential solutions.

Pollen colour in Campanula americana is variable and displays a longitudinal cline from prevalence of deep purple in western populations to white and light-purple pollen in eastern populations. While selection for thermal tolerance probably underlies darker pollen in the west, factors contributing to the predominance of light pollen in eastern populations and the maintenance of colour variation within populations throughout the range are unknown. Here we examine whether pollinators contribute to the maintenance of pollen colour variation in C. americana. Methods In a flight cage experiment, we assessed whether Bombus impatiens foragers can use pollen colour as a reward cue. We then established floral arrays that varied in the frequency of white-and purple-pollen plants in two naturally occurring eastern populations. We observed foraging patterns of wild bees, totalling >1100 individual visits. Key Results We successfully trained B. impatiens to prefer one pollen colour morph. In natural populations, the specialist pollinator, Megachile campanulae, displayed a strong and consistent preference for purple-pollen plants regardless of morph frequency. Megachile also exhibited a bias toward pollen-bearing male-phase flowers, and this bias was more pronounced for purple pollen. The other main pollinators, Bombus spp. and small bees, did not display pollen colour preference. Conclusions Previous research found that Megachile removes twice as much pollen per visit as other bees and can deplete pollen from natural populations. Taken together, these results suggest that Megachile could reduce the reproductive success of plants with purple pollen, resulting in the prevalence of light-coloured pollen in eastern populations of C. americana. Our research demonstrates that pollinator preferences may play a role in the maintenance of pollen colour variation in natural populations.",,,,,"Ison, Jennifer/0000-0003-3857-2859",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,1095-8290,,,,May-08,2019,123,6,,,,,951,960,,10.1093/aob/mcy211,,,,,,,WOS:000483017200003,30566588,,,,

In northern-hemisphere systems, mass flowering plants can act as pollinator magnets. Magnets can reduce the pollination success of adjacent co-flowering neighbours by drawing pollinators from these plants. However, magnets can also produce pollination spillover-effects through increased pollinator movements to adjacent co-flowering taxa, potentially either increasing pollination or impacting it through transfer of mixed-species pollen. The impact of agricultural species on co-flowering plants in Australia is unknown. Native Australian plants evolved with unique pollinators and yet agricultural pollination is dominated by the exotic honeybee Apis mellifera. We tested how distance (to 250 m) from each of two populations of Lavender (Lavandula spp.) (2 years), Nectarines (Prunus persica var. nucipersica or var. nectarina) (1 year) and the pasture weed Patersons Curse (Echium plantagineum) (2 years) affected pollinator diversity and abundance within experimental arrays of native and northern-hemisphere plants. For Patersons Curse, we tested whether visitation varied when honeybee abundance was experimentally increased. As expected, we found magnets attracted significantly more honeybee visits in all possible comparisons across combinations of species, sites and years. However, contrary to expectation, in 10 of 18 comparisons, co-flowering species supported a slightly higher diversity of pollinators than magnets, with honeybees comprising a significantly lower proportion of flower visitors in 14 comparisons. The exceptions, which included populations of all three magnet species, were cases where honeybees were the only visitor (6 comparisons) or the magnet and co-flowering species were each visited by a single but different pollinator (2 compariosns). Most strikingly, our data provided no evidence of pollinator spillover. More than 95% of all pollinators on co-flowering species carried only their pollen and overall pollinator abundance didn't vary significantly with distance from magnets at any site or time. Honeybee abundance did not vary significantly with distance from magnets. For Patersons Curse, the addition of managed hives increased honeybee abundance on co-flowering species in two of eight cases, but pollinator abundance didn't vary with distance from the magnet. Overall, we found few direct effects of mass flowering agricultural species on the pollination of either Australian native or exotic neighbours. The lack of spillover-effects may largely reflect the unusually high species fidelity of foraging A. mellifera. However, the numerical dominance of honeybees within Australian agricultural systems may impact pollination at the regional level.",,,,"Ayre, David J/A-8761-2008; Denham, Andrew/E-3545-2012","Ayre, David J/0000-0002-3124-4417; Denham, Andrew/0000-0002-8375-2747",,,,,,,,,,,,0167-8809,1873-2305,,,,May-01,2019,277,,,,,,83,94,,10.1016/j.agee.2019.03.010,,,,,,,WOS:000482173400010,,,,,

Resultant fragmentation and loss of suitable foraging habitats, combined with pesticide exposure, may increase demands on foraging, specifically the ability to collect or reach sufficient resources under such stress. Understanding effects that pesticides have on flight performance is therefore vital if we are to assess colony success in these changing landscapes. Neonicotinoids are one of the most widely used classes of pesticide across the globe, and exposure to bees has been associated with reduced foraging efficiency and homing ability. One explanation for these effects could be that elements of flight are being affected, but apart from a couple of studies on the honeybee (Apis mellifera), this has scarcely been tested. Here, we used flight mills to investigate how exposure to a field realistic (10 ppb) acute dose of imidacloprid affected flight performance of a wild insect pollinator-the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris audax. Intriguingly, observations showed exposed workers flew at a significantly higher velocity over the first 3/4 km of flight. This apparent hyperactivity, however, may have a cost because exposed workers showed reduced flight distance and duration to around a third of what control workers were capable of achieving. Given that bumblebees are central place foragers, impairment to flight endurance could translate to a decline in potential forage area, decreasing the abundance, diversity, and nutritional quality of available food, while potentially diminishing pollination service capabilities.",,,,,"Gill, Richard/0000-0001-9389-1284; Kenna, Daniel/0000-0001-9427-697X; Pretelli, Ilaria/0000-0002-8244-5737",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,MAY,2019,9,10,,,,,5637,5650,,10.1002/ece3.5143,,,,,,,WOS:000470923500008,31160987,,,,

Queens moved their wings with significantly higher frequency, performing longer pulses of wing beats than drones and workers. Drones vibrated their wings with the frequency similar to workers, but they performed significantly shorter pulses of wing beating. In workers, the frequency of wing beats and the duration of wing-beating pulses were significantly different among various behaviors.

Although the diversity of herbivorous insects in urban areas mostly depends on the availability of flowering plants and nesting sites, predators and parasitoids generally require a larger number of resources during their life cycle, and are expected to be particularly influenced by urbanization. As flower-visitors can easily move between habitat patches, the effect of urbanization was tested at multiple spatial scales (local, landscape and sub-regional). We found that urbanization influenced predator and parasitoid flower-visitors at all three spatial scales. At the local scale, streets and buildings negatively influenced evenness of predators and species richness and abundance of parasitoids probably acting as dispersal barrier. At the landscape scale, higher percentage of urban decreased predator abundance, while increasing their evenness, suggesting an increase in generalist and highly mobile species. Area and compactness (i.e. Contiguity index) of urban green interactively influenced predator communities, whereas evenness of parasitoids increased with increasing Contiguity index. At the sub-regional scale, species richness and abundance of predators increased with increasing distance from the city center. Compared to previous studies testing the effect of urbanization, we found little variation in species richness, abundance and evenness along our urbanization gradient. The current insect fauna has been probably selected for its tolerance to habitat loss and fragmentation, being the result of the intensive anthropogenic alteration occurred in the area in the last centuries. Conservation strategies aimed at predator and parasitoid flying insects have to take in account variables at multiple spatial-scales, as well as the complementarity of resources across the landscape.",,,,"Cerretti, Pierfilippo/L-6504-2016","Cerretti, Pierfilippo/0000-0002-9204-3352; Falco, Matteo/0000-0002-2386-873X",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Apr-03,2019,14,4,,,,,,,e0214068,10.1371/journal.pone.0214068,,,,,,,WOS:000463194300030,30943220,,,,

Pollinators provide a foundation for ecological communities by assisting in the reproduction of native plants, yet our understanding of how pollinators such as wild bees respond to variation in fire severity is limited, particularly for forest ecosystems. Here, we took advantage of a natural experiment created by a large-scale, mixed-severity wildfire to provide the first assessment of how wild bee communities are shaped by fire severity in mixed-conifer forest. We sampled bees in the Douglas Fire Complex, a 19,000-ha fire in southern Oregon, USA, to evaluate how bee communities responded to local-scale fire severity. We found that fire severity served a strong driver of bee diversity: 20 times more individuals and 11 times more species were captured in areas that experienced high fire severity relative to areas with the lowest fire severity. In addition, we found pronounced seasonality in the local bee community, with more individuals and more species captured during late summer, especially in severely burned regions of the landscape. Two critical habitat components for maintaining bee populations-flowering plants and boring insect exit holes used by cavity-nesting bees-also increased with fire severity. Although we detected shifts in the relative abundance of several bee and plant genera along the fire severity gradient, the two most abundant bee genera (Bombus and Halictus) responded positively to high fire severity despite differences in their typical foraging ranges. Our study demonstrates that within a large wildfire mosaic, severely burned forest contained the most diverse wild bee communities. This finding has particularly important implications for biodiversity in fire-prone areas given the expected expansion of wildfires in the coming decades.",,,,"Cane, James H/C-1636-2019","Cane, James H/0000-0002-4745-382X; Galbraith, Sara/0000-0002-5138-3297",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,APR,2019,10,4,,,,,,,e02668,10.1002/ecs2.2668,,,,,,,WOS:000472716600014,,,,,

To extend understanding of how shifts in area, biomes, and pollinators impact diversification in plants, we examined the relationships of these shifts to diversification across the mega-genus Salvia. MethodsA chronogram was developed from a supermatrix of anchored hybrid enrichment genomic data and targeted sequence data for over 500 of the nearly 1000 Salvia species. Ancestral areas and biomes were reconstructed using BioGeoBEARS. Pollinator guilds were scored, ancestral pollinators determined, shifts in pollinator guilds identified, and rates of pollinator switches compared. Key ResultsA well-resolved phylogenetic backbone of Salvia and updated subgeneric designations are presented. Salvia originated in Southwest Asia in the Oligocene and subsequently dispersed worldwide. Biome shifts are frequent from a likely ancestral lineage utilizing broadleaf and/or coniferous forests and/or arid shrublands. None of the four species diversification shifts are correlated to shifts in biomes. Shifts in pollination system are not correlated to species diversification shifts, except for one hummingbird shift that precedes a major shift in diversification near the crown of New World subgen. Calosphace. Multiple reversals back to bee pollination occurred within this hummingbird clade. ConclusionsSalvia diversified extensively in different continents, biomes, and with both bee and bird pollinators. The lack of tight correlation of area, biome, and most pollinator shifts to the four documented species diversification shifts points to other important drivers of speciation in Salvia.",,,,"Xiang, Chunlei/Z-1799-2019; Celep, Ferhat/AAH-8102-2019","Xiang, Chunlei/0000-0001-8775-6967; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9122,1537-2197,,,,APR,2019,106,4,,,,,573,597,,10.1002/ajb2.1268,,,,,,,WOS:000467840300007,30986330,,,,

It has been theorized that life-history traits may constrain some species in their dispersal and lead to greater signatures of population genetic structure. In this study, we use a quantitative comparative approach to assess if patterns of population genetic structure in bees are driven by three key species-level life-history traits: body size, sociality, and diet breadth. Specifically, we reviewed the current literature on bee population genetic structure, as measured by the differentiation indices Nei's G(ST,) Hedrick's G '(ST), and Jost's D. We then used phylogenetic generalised linear models to estimate the correlation between the evolution of these traits and patterns of genetic differentiation. Our analyses revealed a negative and significant effect of body size on genetic structure, regardless of differentiation index utilized. For Hedrick's G '(ST) and Jost's D, we also found a significant impact of sociality, where social species exhibited lower levels of differentiation than solitary species. We did not find an effect of diet specialization on population genetic structure. Overall, our results suggest that physical dispersal or other functions related to body size are among the most critical for mediating population structure for bees. We further highlight the importance of standardizing population genetic measures to more easily compare studies and to identify the most susceptible species to landscape and climatic changes.",,,,"Soro, Antonella/AAG-6840-2020","Soro, Antonella/0000-0002-5239-2080",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,APR,2019,28,8,,,,,1919,1929,,10.1111/mec.15028,,,,,,,WOS:000468200800007,30667117,,,,

However, nesting behaviours of most ground-nesting bees and wasps are poorly understood. Habitat loss, including nesting habitat, threatens populations of ground-nesting bees and wasps. Most ground-nesting bee and wasp studies implement trapping methods that capture foraging individuals, but provide little insight into the nesting preferences of these taxa. Some researchers have suggested that emergence traps may provide a suitable means by which to determine ground-nesting bee and wasp abundance. We sought to evaluate nest-site selection of ground-nesting bees and wasps using emergence traps in two study systems: (1) planted wildflower enhancement plots and fallow control plots in agricultural land; and (2) upland pine and hammock habitat in forests. Over the course of three years (2015-2017), we collected 306 ground-nesting bees and wasps across all study sites from emergence traps. In one study, we compared captures per trap between coloured pan traps and emergence traps and found that coloured pan traps captured far more ground-nesting bees and wasps than did emergence traps. Based on our emergence trap data, our results also suggest ground-nesting bees and wasps are more apt to nest within wildflower enhancement plots than in fallow control plots, and in upland pine habitats than in hammock forests.

Vineyards may be inhabited by plant and animal species, especially when the inter-row space is vegetated with spontaneous vegetation or cover crops. Wild bees depend on floral resources and suitable nesting sites which may be found in vineyard inter-rows or in viticultural landscapes. Inter-row vegetation is managed by mulching, tillage, and/or herbicide application and results in habitat degradation when applied intensively. Here, we hypothesize that lower vegetation management intensities, higher floral resources, and landscape diversity affect wild bee diversity and abundance dependent on their functional traits. We sampled wild bees semi-quantitatively in 63 vineyards representing different vegetation management intensities across Europe in 2016. A proxy for floral resource availability was based on visual flower cover estimations. Management intensity was assessed by vegetation cover (%) twice a year per vineyard. The Shannon Landscape Diversity Index was used as a proxy for landscape diversity within a 750 m radius around each vineyard center point. Wild bee communities were clustered by country. At the country level, between 20 and 64 wild bee species were identified. Increased floral resource availability and extensive vegetation management both affected wild bee diversity and abundance in vineyards strongly positively. Increased landscape diversity had a small positive effect on wild bee diversity but compensated for the negative effect of low floral resource availability by increasing eusocial bee abundance. We conclude that wild bee diversity and abundance in vineyards is efficiently promoted by increasing floral resources and reducing vegetation management frequency. High landscape diversity further compensates for low floral resources in vineyards and increases pollinating insect abundance in viticulture landscapes.",,,,"Kratschmer, Sophie/AAD-4143-2020; Paredes, Daniel/A-2183-2009; Zaller, Johann G/A-9914-2009; Daniela, Popescu/AAB-4621-2019; Guzman, Gema/N-6917-2019","Paredes, Daniel/0000-0002-2681-2256; Zaller, Johann G/0000-0001-7744-7378; Daniela, Popescu/0000-0001-5238-3697; Guzman, Gema/0000-0002-6616-5815; Kratschmer, Sophie/0000-0002-6538-694X",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,APR,2019,9,7,,,,,4103,4115,,10.1002/ece3.5039,,,,,,,WOS:000465089500035,31015991,,,,

Typically, these surveys have found frequent contamination of pollen with multiple pesticides, with most of the estimated risk of acute oral toxicity to honey bees coming from insecticides. In our survey of pesticides in trapped pollen from three commercial ornamental plant nurseries in Connecticut, we found most samples within the range of acute toxicity in a previous state pollen survey, but a few samples at one nursery with unusually high acute oral toxicity. Using visual sorting by color of the pollen pellets collected in two samples from this nursery, followed by pesticide analysis of the sorted pollen and palynology to identify the plant sources of the pollen with the greatest acute toxicity of pesticide residues, we were able to associate pollen from the plant genus Spiraea L.

This study is the first to trace highly toxic pollen collected by honey bees to a single plant genus.

One past approach has been to reduce noise. Lately, with the advance of quantitative tools, an alternative is to use the noise to improve model predictions. Here we take the latter approach to improve our ability to recover honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) foraging locations, in particular the distance at which they forage, from observed waggle dance communications, which encode the vector from the hive to the forage. This vector gives both the distance from the hive to the forage, which is encoded in dance duration, and the direction from the hive to the forage, which is encoded in the angle that the bee makes while dancing. We analysed the waggle dances from individually marked honey bees (N= 859 dances from 85 bees from 3 hives) that foraged at multiple known locations to determine a distance-to-duration calibration. Next we compared this calibration to a previously published calibration, which demonstrated that while their slopes were similar (P = 0.82), their intercepts differed (P < 0.001); however, the individual variation, or noise, between bees was so high that this difference was rendered biologically irrelevant. We then collated our data with all published calibration studies to generate a universal calibration that incorporates the interindividual and interstudy differences. Lastly, we verified that the universal calibration performed as well as a landscape/subspecies-specific calibration, first with a hold-out sample of waggle dances (N = 84) (performance comparison: P = 0.36) and second with a linear discriminant analysis, which failed to assign dances to their originating population. Both results confirm that the universal calibration may be used, irrespective of landscape or subspecies. Therefore, by allowing noise to be part of our analysis, the usability of our calibration is broadened for use in future settings. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

But despite concerns, there have been no empirical studies investigating the impact of A. manicatum on North American pollinators. Therefore, across a two-year study, we monitored foraging behavior and fitness of the common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) in response to A. manicatum presence.

Toads feeding around beehives travelled shorter distances per night, and hence used different microhabitats, than did toads from nearby control sites without beehives. The toads consumed live bees from the hive entrance (rather than dead bees from the ground), often climbing on top of one another to gain access to the hive entrance. Prey manipulation trials confirm that bee movement is the critical stimulus that elicits the toads' feeding response; and in standardized trials, native frogs consumed bees less frequently than did toads.

To quantify the role that these in-field wetlands play in supporting native pollinators, we sampled bees at three distances from the wetland margin into the surrounding cropland (0 m, 25 m and 75 m) across the season in three field types (canola, cereal and perennial grassland). We used Bayesian multilevel models to test the hypothesis that native bees are using infield wetlands as habitat for nesting and foraging. Native bee abundance and diversity decreased further away from the margin of wetlands in both canola and cereal fields, while it increased in wetlands located in perennial grassland. Community composition did not change further away from wetlands, which may be because the foraging range of most species was within the sampling distance of the study. These results suggest that wetlands play an important role in providing critical resources for native pollinators, and encouraging farmers not to drain or plow through these wetlands will have beneficial impacts for native pollinators in the area.

However, empirical evidence for this fundamental assumption is surprisingly scarce and often contradictory. Theoretically, the evolution of alternative life history strategies is underpinned by a trade-off between activity levels and survival. We investigated the consequences of specialization in a foraging context, by comparing the performance and longevity of closely related individuals in a social insect, the common wasp (Vespula vulgaris). Using radio-frequency identification technology, we monitored the lifetime foraging activity of individual wasps from three colonies kept under natural foraging conditions. Returning foragers were video-recorded as they passed the nest entrance so that their foraging load could be assessed. There were substantial differences in foraging activity and survival within and between colonies. At the colony level, foraging specialization was weak. Yet, workers within each nest demonstrated a remarkable range of foraging specialization levels (defined as the degree of overlap between individual and colony-level task allocation) and efficiencies (defined by the number of successful trips and trip duration). We found that specialist foragers were less efficient than generalist siblings within the same colony. Behavioural specialists accomplished fewer successful trips per foraging day, and their trips were typically relatively longer. Specialized foragers also showed reduced life expectancy. The mortality risk was higher for individuals spending relatively more time in the field, yet we found no link between the level of specialization and relative field exposure. Our extensive dataset of unprecedented detail provides strong empirical evidence that behavioural specialization is not associated with a better lifetime performance, on the contrary, the opposite appears true for the common wasp.

Identifying specific factors that influence bee health at the colony level incorporates longitudinal monitoring of physiology across diverse environments. Using a pooled-sampling method to overcome individual variation, we monitored colony-level molecular biomarkers during critical pre-and post-winter time points. Major categories of colony health (nutrition, oxidative stress resistance, and immunity) were impacted by apiary site.

Molecular studies have estimated that bumblebee colonies can be established many kilometers from their queens' natal nest site. However, little is known about when and how queens disperse during their lifespan. One possible life stage when dispersal may occur, is directly after emerging from hibernation. Here, harmonic radar tracking of artificially over-wintered Bombus terrestris queens shows that they spend most of their time resting on the ground with intermittent very short flights (duration and distance). We corroborate these behaviors with observations of wild queen bees, which show similar prolonged resting periods between short flights, indicating that the behavior of our radar-monitored bees was not due to the attachment of transponders nor an artifact of the bees being commercially reared. Radar-monitored flights were not continuously directed away from the origin, suggesting that bees were not intentionally trying to disperse from their artificial emergence site. Flights did not loop back to the origin suggesting bees were not trying to remember or get back to the original release site. Most individuals dispersed from the range of the harmonic radar within less than two days and did not return. Flight directions were not different from a uniform distribution and flight lengths followed an exponential distribution, both suggesting random dispersal. A random walk model based on our observed data estimates a positive net dispersal from the origin over many flights, indicating a biased random dispersal, and estimates the net displacement of queens to be within the range of those estimated in genetic studies. We suggest that a distinct post-hibernation life history stage consisting mostly of rest with intermittent short flights and infrequent foraging fulfils the dual purpose of ovary development and dispersal prior to nest searching.",,,,"Chittka, Lars/C-3110-2012","Chittka, Lars/0000-0001-8153-1732; Solvi, Cwyn/0000-0003-2517-6179; Makinson, James/0000-0001-9772-0802",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,Mar-20,2019,9,,,,,,,,4651,10.1038/s41598-019-40355-6,,,,,,,WOS:000461760100001,30894590,,,,

This cuticular maturation heterochrony may be associated with life style, considering that eusocial bees remain protected inside the nest for many days after emergence, while the solitary bees immediately start outside activities. To address this issue, we characterized gene expression using large-scale RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and quantified cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in comparative studies of the integument (cuticle plus its underlying epidermis) of two eusocial and a solitary bee species. In addition, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for studying the developing cuticle of these and other three bee species also differing in life style. We found 13,200, 55,209 and 30,161 transcript types in the integument of the eusocial Apis mellifera and Frieseomelitta varia, and the solitary Centris analis, respectively. In general, structural cuticle proteins and chitin-related genes were upregulated in pharate-adults and newly-emerged bees whereas transcripts for odorant binding proteins, cytochrome P450 and antioxidant proteins were overrepresented in foragers. Consistent with our hypothesis, a distance correlation analysis based on the differentially expressed genes suggested delayed cuticle maturation in A. mellifera in comparison to the solitary bee. However, this was not confirmed in the comparison with F. varia. The expression profiles of 27 of 119 genes displaying functional attributes related to cuticle formation/differentiation were positively correlated between A. mellifera and F. varia, and negatively or non-correlated with C. analis, suggesting roles in cuticular maturation heterochrony. However, we also found transcript profiles positively correlated between each one of the eusocial species and C. analis. Gene co-expression networks greatly differed between the bee species, but we identified common gene interactions exclusively between the eusocial species. Except for F. varia, the TEM analysis is consistent with cuticle development timing adapted to the social or solitary life style. In support to our hypothesis, the absolute quantities of n-alkanes and unsaturated CHCs were significantly higher in foragers than in the earlier developmental phases of the eusocial bees, but did not discriminate newly-emerged from foragers in C. analis.

Among the species of special concern in Europe are bees, which, along with butterflies, are the best monitored insects. Bees are most species-rich in Mediterranean-type climates with short winters, warm springs, and dry summers. In Central Europe, climate warming per se is, therefore, expected to benefit most bee species, while pesticides and the loss of habitats and plant diversity should constitute threats. Here, we use the bee fauna of Germany, which has been monitored for Red Lists for over 40 years, to analyse the effects of habitat breadth, pollen specialization, body size, nesting sites, sociality, duration of flight activity, and time of emergence during the season. We tested each factor's predictive power against changes in commonness and Red List status, using phylogenetically informed hierarchical Bayesian (HB) models. Extinction vulnerability is strongly increased in bees flying in late summer, with a statistical model that included flight time, habitat preference, and duration of activity correctly predicting the vulnerability status of 85% of the species. Conversely, spring emergence and occurrence in urban areas each reduce vulnerability, pointing to intensive land use especially harming summer-active bees, with the combination of these factors currently shifting Germany's bee diversity towards warm-adapted, spring-flying, city-dwelling species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,Mar-06,2019,286,1898,,,,,,,20190316,10.1098/rspb.2019.0316,,,,,,,WOS:000465433600019,30836868,,,,

We show that the abundance of all pollinator groups responded to fire severity, and that bees and beetles showed in addition a significant species-diversity response. Bees, sawflies, and wasps responded to fire severity at relatively small spatial scales (250-300 m), whereas flies and beetles responded at larger spatial scales. The response of bees, sawflies, and wasps was unimodal, as predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, whereas flies and beetles showed a negative response. A possible explanation is that the observed patterns (spatial scale and type of response) are driven by taxa-specific ecological and life-history traits, such as nesting preference and body size, as well as the availability of resources in the postfire landscape.

However, bee response to the disturbance of biomass harvesting may depend on their nesting location, thus their vulnerability to nest destruction, and the response of the forb community on which they forage. Moreover, because bees have long foraging ranges, effects of local harvesting may depend on the amount of natural habitat in the surrounding landscape. We performed a large-scale one- and two-year experiment in Michigan and Wisconsin, USA, respectively, to examine how grassland harvesting, landscape context, and study year affect the forb community, above- and belowground-nesting bee species richness, community composition, trap nest emergence, and visitation rate. In Wisconsin, harvesting increased forb richness, cover, and evenness compared to unharvested control sites. Harvesting negatively affected aboveground-nesting bee richness and emergence from trap nests, possibly because of nest destruction during the previous harvest. By contrast, harvesting positively affected belowground-nesting bee richness, possibly because of the greater food resource availability and reduced thatch allowing greater access to nesting sites in the soil. Harvesting also affected bee community composition, reflecting the increase in belowground-nesting species at harvested sites. Despite harvesting effects on forb and bee communities, there was no effect on flower visitation rate, indicating little effect on pollination function. We did not find a harvest by landscape context interaction, which, in combination with the negative harvesting effect on trap nest emergence, suggests that harvesting can affect local population growth rather than simply affecting forager aggregation in different resource environments. For bees, there was no harvest by study year interaction, indicating a consistent response over a short timescale. Similarly, in Michigan, belowground-nesting species also responded positively to harvesting, which was more pronounced in sandier soils that are preferred for nesting. However, other components of the Michigan bee and forb communities were not significantly affected by biomass harvesting. Overall, our study demonstrates that harvesting grasslands can positively affect the similar to 80% of bee species that nest belowground by enhancing nest and/or forage resources, but that conserving aboveground nesters may require leaving some area unharvested.",,,,"Isaacs, Rufus/AAF-4646-2019","Isaacs, Rufus/0000-0001-7523-4643",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,MAR,2019,29,2,,,,,,,UNSP e01828,10.1002/eap.1828,,,,,,,WOS:000460170200003,30412332,,,,

Planning effective enhancements can be informed with pollination service models, but these models should capture the behavioural and spatial dynamics of service-providing organisms. Model predictions, and hence management recommendations, are likely to be sensitive to these dynamics. We used two established models of pollinator foraging to investigate whether habitat enhancement improves crop visitation; whether this effect is influenced by pollinator foraging distance and landscape pattern; and whether behavioural detail improves model predictions. The more detailed central place foraging model better predicted variation in bee visitation observed between habitat types, because it includes optimized trade-offs between patch quality and distance. Both models performed well when predicting visitation rates across broader scales. Using real agricultural landscapes and simulating habitat enhancements, we show that additional floral resources can have diverging effects on predicted crop visitation. When only co-flowering resources were added, optimally foraging bees concentrated in enhancements to the detriment of crop pollination. For both models, adding nesting resources increased crop visitation. Finally, the marginal effect of enhancements was greater in simple landscapes. Synthesis and applications. Model results help to identify the conditions under which habitat enhancements are most likely to increase pollination services in agriculture. Three design principles for pollinator habitat enhancement emerge: (a) enhancing only flowers can diminish services by distracting pollinators away from crops, (b) providing nesting resources is more likely to increase bee populations and crop visitation and (c) the benefit of enhancements will be greatest in landscapes that do not already contain abundant habitat.",,,,,"Olsson, Ola/0000-0003-0789-1064",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,MAR,2019,56,3,,,,,618,628,,10.1111/1365-2664.13333,,,,,,,WOS:000459941400013,,,,,

The diversity of bee species in rural landscapes is influenced by the type of landscape features present, and by land-use and management practices. A key challenge is to understand and predict how species vary across the landscape; and the role of functional traits in determining compositional patterns. We systematically sampled wild bees in four types of landscape feature - open farmland, scattered farmland trees, roadside vegetation and streamside vegetation - in rural landscapes in southern Australia. Landscapes were selected to represent wooded or non-wooded combinations of these site types (e.g. roadside vegetation with or without trees), embedded in farmland with different land-uses (e.g. cropping, grazing). The species richness and abundance of bees was greater at sites containing little or no tree cover; and the cumulative richness of species was greater for tree-less sites than for those with trees. In contrast, species evenness was greatest in wooded site types, indicating these were less dominated by abundant generalist species. Open farmland and treeless road-sides had greater functional diversity (based on species traits) than wooded site types. Strong species trait associations were more numerous with open parts of the landscape, reflecting the greater functional diversity of open site types. These results suggest that a suite of the extant bee fauna can exploit large-scale transformation from former extensively wooded ecosystems to open agricultural landscapes. However, not all species are able to exploit modified landscapes and may disappear with further loss of wooded vegetation. Trait-based approaches provide insight into how changes in landscape pattern affect the bee fauna. Failure to adequately cater for multiple functional groups of bees across all landscape features could mean a substantial loss in species that rely on more natural cover, thus affecting ecosystem function.",,,,"Hall, Mark/I-5589-2019; Cunningham, Saul A/B-9947-2009","Hall, Mark/0000-0003-4273-980X; Cunningham, Saul A/0000-0003-0703-6893",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3207,1873-2917,,,,MAR,2019,231,,,,,,1,12,,10.1016/j.biocon.2018.12.032,,,,,,,WOS:000459357500001,,,,,

No significant colony-level effects were observed at lower dose rates.

To reach this goal, we first examined and compared the foraging behaviors of three distinct bee species, the European honey bee, Apis mellifera L., the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens Cr., and the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata F., foraging on Medicago sativa flowers. Each foraging behavior investigated differed among bee species. Both social bees exhibited directionality of movement and had similar residence, in contrast to the random movement and shorter residence of the solitary bee. Tripping rate and net distance traveled differed among the three bee species. We ranked each behavior among bee species and used the relative ranking as gene flow predictor before testing the predictions against empirical gene flow data. Tripping rate and net distance traveled, but not residence, predicted relative gene dispersal among bee species.

Here, we contrast community-level patterns of floral visitation by honey bees with that of the diverse native pollinator fauna of southern California, USA. We show that the number of honey bees visiting plant species increases much more rapidly with flower abundance than does that of non-honey bee insects, such that the percentage of all visitors represented by honey bees increases with flower abundance. Thus, honey bees could disproportionately impact the most abundantly blooming plant species and the large numbers of both specialized and generalized pollinator species that they sustain. Honey bees may preferentially exploit high-abundance floral resources because of their ability to recruit nest-mates; these foraging patterns may cause native insect species to forage on lower-abundance resources to avoid competition.

To document bee assemblages in nopal orchards in the Llanos de Ojuelos, southern Mexican Plateau, and to assess the influence of adjacent habitats on them, we surveyed bees in nopal orchards adjacent to cropland (Cr-orchards) and adjacent to natural shrubland patches (Sh-orchards), and in remnants of natural shrubland. We used color traps and manual capture from flowers during the 2016 and 2017 peaks of Opuntia blooming periods. We hypothesized that Sh-orchards would harbor richer and larger native bee assemblages than Cr-orchards, and that assemblages' similarity between these Sh-orchards and shrublands would be greater than between Cr-orchards and shrublands. We collected 3823 individuals of 45 different bee taxa; 90% of all taxa, in nopal orchards. Our results partially support the premise that proximity of natural habitats to agricultural plots is positive for their bee overall abundance, but distance from shrublands did not impoverish bee species richness. Mean similarity values between Cr-orchards, Sh-orchards, and shrublands were not significantly different, as result of shrubland patches being very variable. As a result of their perennial condition and limited agricultural practices, nopal orchards provide shelter, forage, and nest substrate for native bee species, albeit perhaps less in Cr-orchards than in Sh-orchards, and likely facilitate bee movement between orchards and, or shrublands through a matrix of annual croplands. In doing so, this agroecosystem enhances regional bee community resilience in the context of an anthropized landscape.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-8809,1873-2305,,,,Feb-15,2019,272,,,,,,199,205,,10.1016/j.agee.2018.11.019,,,,,,,WOS:000468247700021,,,,,

Urban agricultural sites are a growing component of urban landscapes and have potential to serve as a source of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provisioning in urban areas. In 19 urban agricultural sites, we investigated how surrounding land cover and local site variables supported bees and pollination services. We found the abundance of bees differentially responded to landscape and local scale variables depending on body size and nesting habit. Large-bodied bees, Bombus and Apis species, were positively associated with increasing amounts of impervious cover, while the abundance of small-bodied soil nesting Halictus species increased as the proportion of flower area, a local variable, increased. Bee richness declined with increasing levels of impervious cover, while bee community composition changed along a gradient of increasing impervious cover. Pollination services, measured at each site using sentinel cucumber plants, declined as hardscape, a local variable, increased. To improve bee conservation and pollination services in urban agricultural sites, our results suggest urban planning strategies should minimize impervious cover at large spatial scales while land managers should focus locally on incorporating floral resources, which increases food and nesting resources especially for smaller bee species. Local site design coupled with regional urban planning can advance the success of urban agriculture, while benefiting biodiversity by creating opportunities for pollinator conservation in urban landscapes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Feb-13,2019,14,2,,,,,,,e0212034,10.1371/journal.pone.0212034,,,,,,,WOS:000458761300071,30759171,,,,

Desert ants travel widely every day, showing unrivaled navigation performance using only a few thousand neurons. In the desert, pheromones are instantly destroyed by the extreme heat. To navigate safely in this hostile environment, desert ants assess their heading from the polarized pattern of skylight and judge the distance traveled based on both a stride-counting method and the optic flow, i.e., the rate at which the ground moves across the eye. This process is called path integration (PI). Although many methods of endowing mobile robots with outdoor localization have been developed recently, most of them are still prone to considerable drift and uncertainty. We tested several ant-inspired solutions to outdoor homing navigation problems on a legged robot using two optical sensors equipped with just 14 pixels, two of which were dedicated to an insect-inspired compass sensitive to ultraviolet light. When combined with two rotating polarized filters, this compass was equivalent to two costly arrays composed of 374 photosensors, each of which was tuned to a specific polarization angle. The other 12 pixels were dedicated to optic flow measurements. Results show that our ant-inspired methods of navigation give precise performances. The mean homing error recorded during the overall trajectory was as small as 0.67% under lighting conditions similar to those encountered by ants.

However, the spatial ecology of B.hypnorum has not previously been investigated. To address this issue, and to investigate whether specific features of the spatial ecology of B.hypnorum are associated with its rapid range expansion, we used 14 microsatellite markers to estimate worker foraging distance, nest density, between-year lineage survival rate and isolation by distance in a representative UK B.hypnorum population. After assigning workers to colonies based on full or half sibship, we estimated the mean colony-specific worker foraging distance as 103.6m, considerably less than values reported from most other bumble bee populations. Estimated nest density was notably high (2.56 and 0.72 colonies ha(-1) in 2014 and 2015, respectively), estimated between-year lineage survival rate was 0.07, and there was no evidence of fine-scale isolation by distance. In addition, genotyping stored sperm dissected from sampled queens confirmed polyandry in this population (mean minimum mating frequency of 1.7 males per queen).

Naturally occurring wild flowers (i.e. agricultural weeds) offer a free, sustainable, and often underappreciated resource for pollinators, however, they may compete with crop flowers for visits. To understand the extent to which floral resources mediate pollinator visitation to courgette flowers and courgette fields, plant community and pollinator visitation data were collected at two spatial scales: field scale (in margins, and in the cropped area) and farm scale (500 m and 2000 m radii) for nine courgette fields across the UK. Apis mellifera (honeybees) and Bombus spp. (bumblebees) were the only pollinators observed to visit courgette flowers. Bumblebees were significantly more abundant on courgette flowers in fields with a greater species richness of wild flowers in the crop, whilst honeybees were significantly more abundant on courgette flowers in areas with less semi-natural habitat. For both honeybees and bumblebees, their abundance in field margins did not significantly reduce their abundance on courgette flowers, suggesting that wild flowers were not competing with courgette flowers for pollinator visitation. Although solitary bees were not observed to visit courgette flowers, their abundance and species richness in courgette fields were significantly greater with more semi-natural habitat and a greater species richness of wild flowers. Therefore, allowing uncultivated areas around the crop to be colonised by species-rich wild flowers is an effective way of boosting the abundance of bumblebees, which are important visitors to courgette flowers, as well as the abundance and species richness of solitary bees, thereby benefitting pollinator conservation.

In these landscapes, wild pollinators depend on fragments of semi-natural habitat for foraging or reproduction. Small forest patches are often the most abundant type of semi-natural habitat in these agricultural landscapes. We investigated the role these patches play in conserving the pollinator community in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. Our survey of the pollinator community in 16 forest fragments showed that the pollinator community in the edges of small forest fragments is strongly influenced by forest and forest edge characteristics. Old forest fragments with a well-developed herb layer had more diverse bee communities than recent forests or old forests without a herb layer, but overall lower activity-abundances, while sun exposure of the forest edges had a strong positive effect on pollinator activity-abundance in general. The hoverfly community had higher activity-abundances in forest edges with a higher flower-index, while saproxylic hoverflies were caught in higher numbers in sites with a higher forest cover in the surrounding landscape. We also detected a strong seasonal effect. The effects of herb layer cover on bee species richness and activity-abundance were much stronger in spring than in summer, while bee species richness was also strongly positively correlated with forest age in spring. A strong positive correlation between pollinator species richness and sun exposure was found in summer, after canopy closure. While the sampled forest edges harbour a rich and diverse pollinator community, cavity-nesting bees were very scarce. This is probably caused by the low amount of dead wood in the studied forest fragments. We conclude that small forest fragments can play an important role in conserving the pollinator community, especially bees and saproxylic hoverflies. The importance of these forest fragments is strongest in spring, when the herb layer provides foraging resources. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

In this article, I review the rationale and behavioral evidence for this metric cognitive map hypothesis, and find it unpersuasive: in practice, there is little evidence for truly novel shortcuts in animals, and human performance is highly unreliable and biased by environmental features. I develop the alternative hypothesis that spatial knowledge is better characterized as a labeled graph: a network of paths between places augmented with local metric information. What distinguishes such a cognitive graph from a metric cognitive map is that this local information is not embedded in a global coordinate system, so spatial knowledge is often geometrically inconsistent. Human path integration appears to be better suited to piecewise measurements of path lengths and turn angles than to building a consistent map. In a series of experiments in immersive virtual reality, we tested human navigation in non-Euclidean environments and found that shortcuts manifest large violations of the metric postulates. The results are contrary to the Euclidean map hypothesis and support the cognitive graph hypothesis.

Recent modelling of these abilities shows convergence on a small set of algorithms and assumptions that appear sufficient to account for a wide range of behavioural data.

However, the degree to which seed set in B. napus depends on insect pollination is still under debate. To compare research approaches for estimating pollinator dependency, we reviewed the relevant literature published between 1956 and 2018. The majority of the studies were conducted in Europe (75%) on winter cultivars (77%) and monitored honeybees (52%). Our main findings are: (1) Dependency on insect pollination differs among cultivars and regions. (2) Field observations provide more realistic and comparable results than observations on caged plants. (3) Field conditions, soil nutrient availability, and pest management practices all influence insect dependency and subsequent yield. (4) Plot size conditions pollinator behaviour, as pollination success can be related to insect density or diversity depending on the size of the plot. (5) Insect numbers vary according to the observation distances within a field. (6) Comparison between studies is complicated by the use of different proxies to assess final yield, which may not be equivalent.

In particular, the presence of a rewarding plant species may increase the rate of pollinator visitation to a less rewarding species in its vicinity, but the beneficial increase in visitation may be counteracted by a detrimental increase in heterospecific pollen transfer. We assessed this trade-off using bumble-bees foraging over a gradual spatial transition between two plant species in an indoor cage experiment. Methods We used two species' of artificial flowers - one more rewarding than the other - in arrays that varied in the degree of species intermingling. The flowers dispensed and received powdered food dyes serving as pollen analogues. Captive bumble-bees visited to collect sucrose solution. We quantified dye delivery to the adhesive-tape stigmas' in flowers by spectrophotometry. Key Results Across the spatial transition between species, the less attractive species received more dye (more bee visits) when in proximity to the more attractive species than it did when alone, but the larger dye loads were less pure (more heterospecific pollen transfer). The decline in purity cancelled out the gain in acquisition, so conspecific pollen receipt by the less attractive species was neutrally affected. The more attractive species received fewer visits when surrounded by the less attractive species, so the interaction between the two species was amensalism when considering conspecific pollen reception.

Phylogenetic studies show multiple gains and losses of floral nectar in the species-rich genus Pedicularis. Here we explore how experimental addition of nectar to a supposedly nectarless species, P. dichotoma, influences pollinator foraging behaviour. Methods The liquid (nectar) at the base of the corolla tube in P. dichotoma was investigated during anthesis. Sugar components were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. To understand evolutionary transitions of nectar, artificial nectar was added to corolla tubes and the reactions of bumble-bee pollinators to extra nectar were examined. Key Results A quarter of unmanipulated P. dichotoma plants contained measurable nectar, with 0.01-0.49 L per flower and sugar concentrations ranging from 4 to 39 %. The liquid surrounding the ovaries in the corolla tubes was sucrose-dominant nectar, as in two sympatric nectariferous Pedicularis species. Bumble-bees collected only pollen from control (unmanipulated) flowers of P. dichotoma, adopting a sternotribic pollination mode, but switched to foraging for nectar in manipulated (nectar-supplemented) flowers, adopting a nototribic pollination mode as in nectariferous species. This altered foraging behaviour did not place pollen on the ventral side of the bees, and sternotribic pollination also decreased. Conclusion Our study is the first to quantify variation in nectar production in a supposedly nectarless' Pedicularis species. Flower manipulations by adding nectar suggested that gain (or loss) of nectar would quickly result in an adaptive behavioural shift in the pollinator, producing a new location for pollen deposition and stigma contact without a shift to other pollinators. Frequent gains of nectar in Pedicularis species would be beneficial by enhancing pollinator attraction in unpredictable pollination environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,1095-8290,,,,Jan-23,2019,123,2,,,SI,,373,380,,10.1093/aob/mcy102,,,,,,,WOS:000462548600012,29878060,,,,

Dense patches of flowering plants can result in increased pollinator attraction and, consequently, higher pollination and seed set per flower. We investigated this effect in the endangered, self-incompatible Australian daisy Rutidosis leptorhynchoides F. Muell. (Asteraceae) by quantifying the effect of plant density on pollinator visitation and seed set in a wild population. Pollinator activity was investigated by direct observation of insect behaviour, by examining the pollen carried on candidate insect species, by video monitoring of visitation, and by tracking the movement of dye as a pollen analogue. Two native Lasioglossum species (Hymenoptera: Halictidae) were identified as the most frequent pollen-carrying visitors to inflorescences. Their visitation was significantly higher where plants were dense, but no statistical correlation between seed set and plant density was found. Florivory was identified as potentially having a substantial negative influence on seed set, but without any clear relationship to plant density. Given that R. leptorhynchoides has declined substantially across its range, and previous reintroduction attempts have often failed, our findings provide key information pertaining to knowledge of pollinator and florivore behaviour in relation to plant density.

In the next step of fabrication, building compact models and developing parameter extraction methods have critical importance in designing electronic circuits using fabricated OFETs. In this paper, we propose a parameter extraction approach which benefits from the power of metaheuristics. Although direct extraction tools offer analytical solutions in successive steps to extract model parameters, metaheuristics-based global optimization methods can find all parameters at once by exploring a wide range of parameters. Direct extraction tools are cumbersome and need human expertise. On the other hand, global optimization methods are very flexible, adaptive and can be automated as parameter extraction tools of any compact model. In this study, we introduce three different global optimization algorithms, namely, a genetic algorithm (GA), a hybrid artificial bee colony (h-ABC) algorithm, and bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) algorithm, for the parameter extraction. To the best of our knowledge, h-ABC and BFO algorithms have been used for the first time in extracting parameters of OFET compact models. We use two OFET compact models developed by Estrada et al. and Marinov et al. for two different datasets of OFET transistors, both having pentacene as organic semiconductor. While one of the dataset of transistor (T1) is available in literature, the dataset of the other transistor fabricated in our laboratory (T2) is generated as a new dataset. In order to tune control parameters of the developed algorithms, Taguchi's orthogonal experimental design (OED) method is used. Experimental results show that the proposed metaheuristics-based approach can extract model parameters successfully and can perform better than direct extraction methods. The studied OFET compact models fit to the experimental data with these parameters and predict similar output characteristic curves. The algorithms show a good agreement with the experimental data of T1 and T2, having normalized root-mean-square error values under 3.70%, and 8.74% for the models of Estrada et al. and Marinov et al., respectively. It is shown that h-ABC and BFO algorithms perform better than GA on average. It is also observed that the compact model by Estrada et al. performs better for both T1 and T2 compared to the model of Marinov et al.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-3536,,,,,,2019,7,,,,,,180438,180450,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2959474,,,,,,,WOS:000509483800249,,,,,

A combined method for sampling pollen loads and garbage pellets at nest entrances in four stingless bees with different entrance size and forager traffic was here successfully used. Sampling was carried out in a short period of time (late winter) and located within a distance of 50 m. Pollen analysis using acetolysis showed that most identified pollen types (31) were from native species, 12 from ornamental exotic species, 5 included native and ornamental exotic species and 18 of uncertain status. A much broader pollen spectrum was present in garbage pellets (62 types) than loads (14 types). A few resources from previous blooming (late spring-summer) were identified in garbage pellets, which were mainly composed of current flowerings. From the 66 pollen types found in all samples, many (18) remained unidentified due to the complex nature of the vegetation surrounding the nests and the generalist behaviour of these bees. The versatile foraging behaviour on spontaneous (mostly native) and cultivated (mostly ornamental exotic) pollen resources is an important issue for the conservation and rearing of stingless bee colonies in urban habitats where native flora is preserved, particularly the riparians, where a high richness of blooming plants is available.",,,,"Vossler, Favio Gerardo/O-3049-2015","Vossler, Favio Gerardo/0000-0001-9985-1697",,,,,,,,,,,,0001-3765,1678-2690,,,,,2019,91,4,,,,,,,UNSP e20190360,10.1590/0001-3765201920190360,,,,,,,WOS:000499795200001,31778461,,,,

Sulfoxaflor is a recently developed systemic insecticide in the new sulfoximine class of insecticides and has shown high efficiency against a wide range of pest insects. The main objective of this study was therefore to assess the effects of sulfoxaflor on the buff-tailed or large earth bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), known as an important generalist pollinator of wild plants and many agricultural crops worldwide. To achieve this objective, a laboratory bioassay with queenless bumblebee microcolonies that had been previously developed and used to assess for both toxicity and effects on foraging behaviour in B. terrestris for neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam), was specifically employed. Here, microcolonies of B. terrestris workers, with or without the need to forage for food, were exposed to sugar water supplemented with field-realistic concentrations of sulfoxaflor (starting from 15 mu g/ml to 5 and 1 mu g/ml) via oral exposure during 15 days. In addition to a significant reduction in bumblebee worker survival, the results also indicated that there was no higher toxicity caused by sulfoxaflor when the bumblebees had to forage for their food compared to when they did not have to forage. These results could guide future studies in this context and could be used in debates on insecticides and/or risk assessment of pesticides with potential effects on behaviour in bumblebees and other pollinators in general.",,,,"Smagghe, Guy/AAE-8914-2019","Smagghe, Guy/0000-0001-8334-3313",,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8177,2363-7102,,,,,2019,39,2,,,,,151,155,,10.1127/entomologia/2019/0784,,,,,,,WOS:000494279500009,,,,,

At a study site in the valley of the river Serio, in Italy, an aggregation of this bee showed low density of randomly distributed nests and was closely surrounded by B. dioica plants. Female nectar foraging and male feeding and mate-searching activity, confined to the host plants, peaked at similar hours across the day, while female pollen foraging peaked earlier. Males fed on plants of both sexes but seemed to perch waiting for females more frequently on male B. dioica leaves. Individual males more often visited only one of the male plants, for up to four days; here they did not interact aggressively with conspecifics, suggesting scramble competition in resource-based home ranges and not territoriality. These findings are preliminarily in accordance with the predicted resource-based rendez-vous sites at low nest density for oligolectic bees and the predicted occurrence of scramble competition in case of high male density.

Predictions based on species distribution models forecast that most bee species will continue to decline as climate change progresses, the few exceptions to this being common, widespread species with large dispersal capabilities. Most of the bees studied so far are temperate or tropical species but many ecosystems are predicted to experience increased aridification under climate change. Therefore, we need to understand how pollinator species are likely to respond. Here we present species distribution models for the arid-adapted Australian small carpenter bee, Ceratina australensis Perkins, 1912 (Apidae: Xylocopinae) under Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change conditions predicted for 2070 (Representative Carbon Pathway 8.5). We applied Maximum Entropy, Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models and Random Forest methods. Overall, our models predict that this bee will have an increased area of suitable habitat as climate change progresses, including an increased range within protected areas. However, its potential range will shift further into coastal areas, that are highly human populated and urbanised. Our results suggest that wild bee taxa may be able to cope with the predicted scale of future aridification under climate change. Finally, this species is predicted to increase in urban environments, which highlights the need for city planning, suitable habitats and green spaces to support wild bee species.

We found little evidence of autogamy in emasculated inflorescences, and though trees were self-compatible, protandry within inflorescences and synchrony of flowering on branch systems were effective at preventing self-fertilization.

Recently, a honeybee pest, the small hive beetle Aethina tumida (hereafter SHB), has been reported in Italy, where it colonized more than 50 apiaries in an area of about 300 km(2). SHB is a nest parasite and scavenger of honeybee colonies native of Sub-Saharian Africa. Likely being helped by the globalization of apiculture, SHB underwent several invasions in the last twenty years, causing locally relevant economic impact. While many features of its biology have been addressed, an important knowledge gap concerns the spatial invasion dynamics in invaded areas. In this paper we coupled two spatial analysis techniques (geographic profiling and a density-based spatial clustering algorithm) to uncover the possible invasion pattern of SHB in Italy. We identified the port town of Gioia Tauro as the most likely point from which SHB may have spread and suggested the possible successive axes of diffusion. These putative diffusion paths suggest that the SHB spread in south Italy might have been due to a mix of natural dispersal between close apiaries and longer distance movement through faster, likely human-mediated, communication routes.

Here, we analyze the successional changes in the bee community in a Mexican tropical dry forest, by integrating taxonomic (species, genus, and family diversity) and functional (sociability, nesting strategy, and body size) information for bees. Over one year, in a successional chronosequence (2-67 years after abandonment) we collected 469 individual bees, representing five families, 36 genera, and 69 species. Linear modeling showed decreases in taxonomic diversity with succession, more strongly so for species. Bee species turnover along succession ranged from moderate to high, decreasing slightly at intermediate stages. An RLQ analysis (ordination method that allows relating environmental variables with functional attributes) revealed clear relations between bee functional traits and the plant community. RLQ axis 1 was positively related to vegetation structural and diversity variables, and to eusociality, while solitary, parasociality, and ground nesting was negatively associated with it. Early successional fallows attract mostly solitary and parasocial bees; older fallows tend to attract eusocial bees with aerial nesting. The continuous taxonomic turnover observed by us and the functional analysis suggest that the disappearance of old fallows from agricultural landscapes would likely result in significant reductions and even local extinctions of particular bee guilds.

While navigating within such environments, animals need to perceive and disambiguate environmental features that might obstruct their flight. The most elemental aspect of aerial navigation through such environments is gap identification and 'passability' evaluation. We used bumblebees to seek insights into the mechanisms used for gap identification when confronted with an obstacle in their flight path and behavioral compensations employed to assess gap properties. Initially, bumblebee foragers were trained to fly though an unobstructed flight tunnel that led to a foraging chamber. After the bees were familiar with this situation, we placed a wall containing a gap that unexpectedly obstructed the flight path on a return trip to the hive. The flight trajectories of the bees as they approached the obstacle wall and traversed the gap were analyzed in order to evaluate their behavior as a function of the distance between the gap and a background wall that was placed behind the gap. Bumblebees initially decelerated when confronted with an unexpected obstacle. Deceleration was first noticed when the obstacle subtended around 35 deg on the retina but also depended on the properties of the gap. Subsequently, the bees gradually traded off their longitudinal velocity to lateral velocity and approached the gap with increasing lateral displacement and lateral velocity. Bumblebees shaped their flight trajectory depending on the salience of the gap, indicated in our case by the optic flow contrast between the region within the gap and on the obstacle, which decreased with decreasing distance between the gap and the background wall. As the optic flow contrast decreased, the bees spent an increasing amount of time moving laterally across the obstacles.

Such communities are widely represented as bipartite networks: graphs depicting interactions between two groups of species, such as plants and pollinators or hosts and parasites. For over thirty years, studies have used indices, such as connectance and species degree, to characterise the structure of these networks and the roles of their constituent species. However, compressing a complex network into a single metric necessarily discards large amounts of information about indirect interactions. Given the large literature demonstrating the importance and ubiquity of indirect effects, many studies of network structure are likely missing a substantial piece of the ecological puzzle. Here we use the emerging concept of bipartite motifs to outline a new framework for bipartite networks that incorporates indirect interactions. While this framework is a significant departure from the current way of thinking about bipartite ecological networks, we show that this shift is supported by analyses of simulated and empirical data. We use simulations to show how consideration of indirect interactions can highlight differences missed by the current index paradigm that may be ecologically important.

Furthermore, pollinator availability can be critical for the success of conservation translocations of threatened flora with such interactions. Here, we investigated the pollination biology of the endangered orchid Caladenia versicolor, with the aim of improving management of wild populations and conservation translocations (artificial translocation for conservation). Using portable groups of cultivated plants to attract pollinators, we found that at natural sites C. versicolor is predominantly pollinated by food-foraging males of one species of bee, Leioproctus platycephalus (Colletidae), with only occasional visits from females or other bee species. This apparently high degree of specialization occurred despite the presence of a co-occurring bee community of >20 species. Although previously thought to be nectarless, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of labellum secretions revealed that C. versicolor produces meagre quantities of sucrose on the upper surface of the labellum, on which some pollinators appeared to feed. Reproductive success was high in C. versicolor at both natural and translocated sites. Although C. versicolor now has a restricted range, L. platycephalus is found across a broad area of southern Australia. Thus, pollinator availability does not appear to have contributed to the rarity of C. versicolor, but the apparent reliance on L. platycephalus means that the availability of this species needs to be taken into account for conservation management and translocations.",,,,,"Bohman, Bjorn/0000-0001-7097-5813; Reiter, Noushka/0000-0001-8450-2769",,,,,,,,,,,,0024-4074,1095-8339,,,,JAN,2019,189,1,,,,,83,98,,10.1093/botlinnean/boy074,,,,,,,WOS:000454041200006,,,,,

The study was conducted in small forest patches of the Atlantic Forest, in the municipality of Salto de Pirapora (SP, Brazil). The spatial analysis was developed based on forest patch size, forest patch core size, distance from the nearest forest patch, and distance from the nearest body of water. Based on these criteria, we selected three hotspot forest patches (including all criteria that favor the presence of stingless bees with arboreal nesting habits) and three control forest patches (which does not fulfill all these criteria), and we evaluated the presence of stingless bees based on the occupation of artificial shelters installed in the patches. From the 72 installed artificial shelters, we observed 27 shelters (37.5%) carrying some association with stingless bees presence. Bees showed a preference for occupying artificial shelters that were located in the patches' cores (66.7%). The structure and composition of the vegetation showed great importance to the occupation of the artificial shelters, as there was a strong correlation between the occupied shelters and the diameter and the height of the trees. There was also a correlation between the presence of grasses and shrubs (p < 0.05), which were the main providers of floral resources. The data of the land cover was an essential factor for the development of spatial analysis, and we found a strong negative correlation with pastures and a positive correlation with forestry (p < 0.05). To elaborate multiscale approaches, it is essential to evaluate the quality of foraging (amount of flowers) and nesting (diameter and height of trees) resources, as well as the surroundings of the patches.

Nonetheless, commercial growers rent honey bee hives for pollination, resulting in the dominance of honey bee workers visiting flowers during bloom.The objective of this study was to examine where on the honey bee pollen is carried and how it is transferred from flower to bee to the stigma of other flowers. Examination of 90 honey bee workers foraging on blueberry flowers documented that blueberry pollen tetrads were present on all body parts. Relative amounts were as follows: head 12%, body 6%, legs 19%, and tarsi 63%. Quantities on the body subregions ranged from an average of 400 tetrads on the basitarsi to 16 on the fore tarsal claws. Thus, a single contact between many of the pollen-carrying body parts and a stigma has the potential to transfer significant amounts of pollen. The study also revealed that bee behaviors unrelated to the intentional collection of nectar and pollen, such as the frequent touching of stigmas by the claws, tarsi, or legs, while foraging, grooming, and walking across flower clusters, could result in pollen transfer.These contacts occurred 65.9% of the time a honey bee landed on a flower cluster.

Different resource requirements and the impact of tongue length on resource use are often overlooked aspects of these studies. Here, we examine floral resource use and niche overlap between introduced social bees and native solitary bees over two flowering seasons on The Remarkables mountain range, South Island, New Zealand. The native bee fauna of New Zealand is composed of short-tongued solitary bees in the families Colletidae and Halictidae. Long-tongued social bees were introduced 150 years ago, and Apis mellifera and Bombus species are now widespread. We analysed floral resource utilization by introduced bees (mainly Bombus terrestris) and native bees in relation to resource abundance across elevations in montane to alpine grassland communities. We modelled resource utilization and overlap between bee taxa using a novel index of floral resource availability, developed to more accurately describe floral density. Additionally, we sought to quantify the impact of honey bees by introducing hives, however, low densities in study plots prevented direct conclusions from being drawn. Native and introduced bees did, however, have distinctly different floral preferences over the flowering season with more niche overlap within, rather than between, native and introduced groups. Introduced bees showed a preference for introduced species in the family Fabaceae which native bees could not access. Native bees heavily utilized introduced Asteraceae as well as native floral resources that introduced bees did not prefer. The limited resource overlap between bee taxa indicated that bee communities in New Zealand may have reduced potential for competition, owing to the different resource requirements of solitary versus social bees and their differing abilities to access floral resources.

Although the short-lived plant Aquilegia canadensis produces large, complex, nectar-rich flowers, 75% of seed, on average, are self-fertilized. Previous experimental results are consistent with the fine-scale SGS expected in selfing populations. In contrast, key floral traits show no evidence of SGS, despite a significant genetic basis to phenotypic variation within populations. In this study, we attempt to resolve these contradictory results by hierarchically sampling plants from two plots nested within each of seven rock outcrops distributed over several km, and comparing the spatial pattern of phenotypic variation in four floral traits with neutral genetic variation at 10 microsatellite loci. For both floral and microsatellite variation, we detected only weak hierarchical structuring and no isolation by distance. The spatial pattern of variation in floral traits was on par with microsatellite polymorphisms. These results suggest regular long-distance gene flow via pollen. At much finer spatial scales within plots, estimates of relatedness were higher (albeit very low) between nearest neighbors than random plants, and declined with increasing distance between neighbors, which is consistent with highly localized seed dispersal. High selfing should yield SGS, but strong inbreeding depression in A. canadensis likely erodes SGS so that reproductive plants exhibit weak structure typical of outcrossers, especially given that outcrossing and consequent gene flow in this species are mediated by strong-flying hummingbirds and bumble bees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-067X,1365-2540,,,,DEC,2018,121,6,,,,,605,615,,10.1038/s41437-018-0065-2,,,,,,,WOS:000449427300009,29491467,,,,

We also use these interaction metrics to explain the effect of environmental factors on the interaction networks. We did this over four vegetation zones <1640m asl, as determined by former botanical studies. Overall, bees were the dominant flower visitors, followed by monkey beetles, and far behind were wasps and flies. The middle elevation zone (650-744 m a.s.l), which is also an ecotone between two distinct botanical zones, had the highest species richness and abundance of interacting plants and insects. Interaction frequency and size of network were also greatest in the middle zone, as were network diversity, generality, and linkage density, while lowest in the peak zone. In sum, there was distinct elevation zoning of flower-visiting insects. The greatest zonal change was between species at the middle compared with peak zone. Large-sized monkey beetles, bees and flies characterized the unique assemblage in the peak zone (1576-1640 m a.s.l.). The insect zonation tracked that of plant assemblages, with air temperature (lapse rate) being the primary driver of bee distribution, with lowest levels in the peak zone. In contrast, beetle distribution was driven mostly by flower assemblages as well as air temperature. In turn, wasp and fly interaction networks were not affected by any of the measured environmental variables.

Here, we test for pollination by mimicry in Diuris (Orchidaceae), a genus hypothesized to attract pollinators via mimicry of a range of co-occurring pea plants (Faboideae). Observations of pollinator behaviour were made for Diuris brumalis using arrays of orchid flowers. An analysis of floral traits in the co-flowering community and spectral reflectance measurements were undertaken to test if Di. brumalis and the pea plants showed strong similarity and were likely to be perceived as the same by bees. Pollen removal and fruit-set were recorded at 18 sites over two years to test if fitness of Di. brumalis increased with the abundance of the model species. Diuris brumalis shares the pollinator species Trichococolletes capillosus and T. leucogenys (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) with co-flowering Faboideae from the genus Daviesia. On Di. brumalis, Trichocolletes exhibited the same stereotyped food-foraging and mate-patrolling behaviour that they exhibit on Daviesia. Diuris and pea plants showed strong morphological similarity compared to the co-flowering plant community, while the spectral reflectance of Diuris was similar to that of Daviesia spp. Fruit-set and pollen removal of Di. brumalis was highest at sites with a greater number of Daviesia flowers. Diuris brumalis is pollinated by mimicry of co-occurring congeneric Faboideae species. Evidence for mimicry of multiple models, all of which share pollinator species, suggests that this may represent a guild mimicry system.

Color vision has been proved in these species, and they are known to predominantly visit flowers using visual signals to collect nutrition. Surprisingly, however, the natural variability of flower signals has been rarely considered, and recent work also suggests bees may tune color vision through experience. We initially measured the spectral variability of flowers from 2 species: Goodenia ovata and Rosemarinus officinalis where free-flying honeybees were observed constantly foraging from conspecific flowers. We empirically determined honeybee color discrimination thresholds for color stimuli considering either absolute- or differential-conditioning discrimination functions. Secondly, we analyzed greenhouse grown wild-type Antirrhinum majus flower petal spectra as well as spectra from mixta and nivea strains of this species, and empirically determined bumblebee color discrimination considering conditioning experience. In all measured cases, within-flower type spectral variability exceeded a 1.0 Receptor Noise threshold, often by several units.

The essence of these processes is the movement of propagules from a parental tree to the site of propagule establishment. The estimation of plant dispersal kernels has remained challenging due to the difficulty of making direct observations. We estimated the dispersal capacity of the endangered palm Euterpe edulis, whose seeds are dispersed by vertebrates and pollen by insects. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model with genetic data from reproductive plants, juveniles, and embryos to estimate dispersal kernels. Our analyses account for genotyping error and uncertainty in parental assignment. Key Results Conclusions We found that seeds were dispersed at most a few hundred meters, but pollen was dispersed up to several kilometers. We hypothesize that this long-distance pollen dispersal is generated mainly by euglossine bees, whereas the main dispersal vectors for short-distance seed dispersal are thrushes. The long-distance dispersal of pollen suggests a high level of gene flow that should maintain genetic diversity of E. edulis. Despite the relation between long-distance dispersal and genetic diversity, we observed low genetic diversity and inbreeding within the local population, which are probably due to restricted gene flow due to the low density of this population and its aggregated spatial distribution. We conclude that if conservation actions are able to restore the population density of E. edulis, the recovery of its genetic diversity will be facilitated because of its high dispersal capacity, especially with regard to pollen.",,,,"Varassin, Isabela Galarda/A-7655-2012; Muschner, Valeria/V-6494-2019; Ovaskainen, Otso/D-9119-2012","Varassin, Isabela Galarda/0000-0001-9189-8765; Muschner, Valeria/0000-0002-0585-4799; Ovaskainen, Otso/0000-0001-9750-4421",,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9122,1537-2197,,,,NOV,2018,105,11,,,,,1802,1812,,10.1002/ajb2.1176,,,,,,,WOS:000450329600004,30347429,,,,

Effective Integrated Crop Pollination (ICP) involves adaptable, targeted and cost-effective management of crop pollination and encourages the use of both wild and managed pollinators where appropriate. In this study we investigate how the addition of honeybee hives affects the community of insects visiting oilseed rape, and if hive number and location affect pollinator foraging and oilseed rape pollination in order to provide evidence for effective ICP. We found that introducing hives increased overall flower visitor numbers and altered the pollinator community, which became dominated by honeybees. Furthermore a greater number of hives did not increase bee numbers significantly but did result in honeybees foraging further into fields. The timing of surveys and proximity to the field edge influenced different pollinators in different ways and represents an example of spatial and temporal complementarity. For example dipteran flower visitor numbers declined away from the field edge whereas honeybees peaked at intermediate distances into the field. Furthermore, no significant effects of survey round on wild bees overall was observed but honeybee numbers were relatively lower during peak flowering and dipteran abundance was greater in later survey rounds. Thus combining diverse wild pollinators and managed species for crop pollination buffers spatial and temporal variation in flower visitation. However we found no effect of insect pollination on seed set or yield of oilseed rape in our trial, highlighting the critical need to understand crop demand for insect pollination before investments are made in managing pollination services.

For our study in open agriculture landscape, we chose aculeate Hymenoptera and hoverflies as two insect, mostly pollinator groups differing in their degree of philopatry within the registered pool of our survey where hoverflies were represented by common generalist species showing high mobility. We tested if these groups appeared in significantly different species numbers in two most contrasting habitats typical for the European open agriculture landscape: patches of flower-rich, semi-natural habitats around fields with a variety of nesting sites and wheat fields in proximity that represented a non-viable agricultural habitat with no nesting and foraging opportunities.

Philopatric species were detected in significantly different species numbers in the two habitat types using both methods. In contrast, highly mobile non-philopatric species showed a mixed pattern.

This study quantified how dietary exposures to environmentally-relevant levels of a neonicotinoid insecticide (imidacloprid) affected foraging and nest building of the western harvester ant over 14 days. Using a replicated design, statistically-significant reductions in ant foraging success (50% or greater) occurred at concentrations as low as 50ppb compared to controls. Both the number of ants entering the maze and the percentage of foraging ants able to locate food were impacted by imidacloprid exposure. Ants exposed to 50ppb also took three times longer than controls to find food in a test maze. This concentration is among the lowest levels of imidacloprid reported to affect ants and is well within the range of concentrations found in pollen and nectar of imidacloprid-treated plants. Ant foraging success was also impaired at comparable levels as those reported for the honey bee. Although more refinement and research are needed, results from this study suggest that the western harvester ant may be useful for screening the effects of neurotoxic chemicals on their navigation and foraging, two behaviors which are critical to maintaining colony health of ants and the ecological services they provide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0963-9292,1573-3017,,,,NOV,2018,27,9,,,,,1179,1187,,10.1007/s10646-018-1976-7,,,,,,,WOS:000448152800001,30187359,,,,

Bumblebees inhabit spatially heterogeneous landscapes that are likely characterized by population sources and sinks. To date, most studies of bumblebee habitat requirements have examined static relationships between worker abundance and habitat characteristics. However, if habitat types are linked by dispersal, source-sink dynamics could alter overall population sensitivity to habitat loss, changing conclusions from static approaches. 2. Here, we used empirically derived spatial matrix models to study source-sink population dynamics of bumblebees in heterogeneous environments. We used these models to assess population sensitivity to habitat loss and to examine the population dynamics that could occur under rapid habitat change. 3. Loss of natural habitat reduced long-term population growth rates, and more natural habitat was required to sustain bumblebee species with long-distance dispersal than species with short-distance dispersal. The long-term relative density of colonies in each habitat type depended on landscape structure and bumblebee dispersal ability. Under most conditions, high-quality habitat contained higher densities of colonies than low-quality habitats. However, low-quality habitat could contain higher densities than high-quality habitats if populations were in long-term decline. 4. Rapid loss or restoration of natural habitat produced transient population dynamics that differed from long-term dynamics. After large landscape perturbations that affected population structure, transient dynamics persisted for 4-8 years and were longest for species with short dispersal in highly aggregated landscapes. While transient dynamics were short in duration, they caused large effects on long-term population density. 5. Synthesis and applications. When habitats are linked by dispersal or populations have recently experienced perturbations, patterns of abundance on the landscape may not reflect variation in habitat quality. Spatially structured matrix population models are practical tools than can be used to account for nonequilibrium and source-sink dynamics. For bumblebees, population sensitivity to habitat loss and the duration of transient dynamics depend on dispersal ability and landscape configuration. Demographic approaches such as ours can help to disentangle population patterns from processes and will therefore be valuable for guiding conservation and management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,NOV,2018,55,6,,,,,2802,2811,,10.1111/1365-2664.13175,,,,,,,WOS:000447296300026,,,,,

Understanding the drivers and spatial scale of gene flow is essential for the management of species living in fragmented landscapes. In plants, contemporary pollen flow is typically modelled as a single spatial process, with pollen flow declining exponentially within a short distance of mother plants. However, growing evidence suggests that many species do not conform to these patterns, often showing an excess of long-distance dispersal events or sometimes even multimodality in dispersal kernels. This suggests that a single function might be insufficient to capture the true complexity of pollination, which in reality is often achieved by multiple pollinators that vary in their foraging ranges and interactions with the landscape. 2. We reconstructed realized pollen flow and assessed pollen immigration for seven populations of the insect-pollinated herb Pulsatilla vulgaris. We quantified the effects of distance, floral resources and landscape composition over multiple spatial scales and tested the hypotheses that within-population pollen flow is related to resources and landscape context measured locally, and that among-population pollen flow is related to features measured at larger spatial scales. 3. We found that pollen flow within populations was more likely to occur amongst near neighbours, but that among-population pollen flow was random with respect to source populations. We further found that local floral density could explain patterns of within-population pollination distances and population-level selfing rates, whereas pollen immigration rates were best explained by the proportion of forest within a radius of 500 m around focal populations. 4. Synthesis. Together, our results suggest that within- and among-population contemporary pollen flow may be governed by different underlying processes, possibly related to differences in the foraging range and habitat use of bee species that contribute to pollination at different scales. This highlights the critical need for researchers to take a more pollinator-eyed view of contemporary pollen flow in plants by (1) recognizing that within- and among-population gene flow by pollen may depend on different sets of pollinators that respond to features at different spatial scales (2) considering additional factors that may alter attractiveness, detectability and accessibility of plants to pollinators beyond the effects of distance.",,,,"Wagner, Helene/E-6090-2011","Wagner, Helene/0000-0001-6261-5922; DiLeo, Michelle/0000-0003-0101-5274",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,NOV,2018,106,6,,,,,2242,2255,,10.1111/1365-2745.12992,,,,,,,WOS:000447412100008,,,,,

We analysed the temporal, spatial and ecological patterns of the diversification of Cucurbita, an American genus of worldwide economic importance. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on six chloroplast regions (5907 bp) to estimate diversification rates and dates of divergence between taxa. This is the first phylogenetic study to include C. radicans, a wild species that is endemic to the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt. We performed analysis of ancestral area reconstruction and paleoreconstructions of species distribution models to understand shifts in wild species ranges. We used principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to evaluate the environmental differentiation among taxa within each Glade. The phylogenetic analyses showed good support for at least six independent domestication events in Cucurbita. The genus Cucurbita showed a time of divergence of 11.24 Ma (6.88-17 Ma 95% HDP), and the dates of divergence between taxa within each group ranged from 0.35 to 6.58 Ma, being the divergence between C. lundelhana and C. okeechobeensis subsp. martinezii the most recent. The diversification rate of the genus was constant through time. The diversification of most wild taxa occurred during the Pleistocene, and its date of divergence is concordant with the dates of divergence reported for specialized bees of the genera Xenoglossa and Peponapis, suggesting a process of coevolution between Cucurbita and their main pollinators that should be further investigated.

In this paper we develop a mechanistic model to investigate under which circumstances interspecific differences in the tradeoff between foraging efficiency and travel costs can allow two central place foraging species to coexist in spite of considerable overlap in resource use. One species (Flyer) has a high basal metabolic rate, but a low relative cost of travelling such that it can use patches at a greater distance from its central place while the minimum patch quality it can economically use is high. The other species (Forager), by contrast, has a lower basal metabolic rate, but higher relative cost of travelling, and can therefore be a more efficient forager and able to use foraging patches of low quality, as long as they are not too far from the nest. We demonstrate that the coexistence of these two species critically depends on landscape composition and structure, with the Flyer outcompeting the Forager in structurally simple, coarse-grained, landscapes with abundant high-quality forage and the Forager outcompeting the Flyer in fine-grained highly diverse landscapes. Coexistence between the two species is possible when the landscape is structurally and compositionally complex, fine-grained, and has both high and low quality forage.

In plants, selection towards early flowering is commonly observed. Pollinator-mediated selection is hypothesized to be a pervasive evolutionary force acting directionally on flowering time. However, pollinator-mediated mechanisms have rarely been tested in realistic field conditions, especially in perennial plants visited by a diversity of generalist insect pollinators. We examined pollinator visitation in eight Echinacea angustifolia populations in western Minnesota, USA, to gauge the potential for pollinator-mediated selection. Echinacea is a common prairie perennial that persists in isolated remnant populations. Echinacea is self-incompatible and is pollinated by a diversity of generalist solitary bees. A previous study found that early flowering Echinacea plants have higher seed set and their reproduction is less pollen-limited than late flowering plants. Twelve times throughout a flowering season, we quantified pollinator visitation rates and pollinator community composition. In three sites, we also estimated the quality of pollinator visits by examining the composition of pollinators' pollen loads brought to Echinacea plants. We found that three aspects of pollination dramatically decreased over the course of the flowering season. 1) Pollinators visited early flowering plants more frequently than late flowering plants. 2) The pollinator community was also less diverse late in the flowering season and became dominated by a single species of small bee, Augochlorella aurata. 3) Pollinators visiting Echinacea late in the season carried proportionally less conspecific pollen compared to pollinators visiting Echinacea early in the flowering season.

Despite the threat to pollination posed by tropical deforestation, it remains an understudied process. In particular, little is known about these dynamics in multi-paternal, successional plant species whose fruits can contain substantial genetic diversity. Given the importance of successional plants in reforestation, quantifying the factors that impact their reproduction is essential for understanding plant gene flow in the context of global change. In this study, we investigated pollen-mediated gene flow at the multi-paternal fruit level to quantify how tropical pollinators navigate and mediate gene flow in altered forests. Utilizing microsatellite genotyping and paternity analyses, we revealed that distinct plant neighborhood and individual factors drive pollen dispersal at the intra-fruit scale. Variance in pollen dispersal distances was greater for neighborhoods with higher conspecific density, indicating that density dependent reproductive patterns play a role at this scale. Additionally, both the diversity and evenness of sires mediated by a single pollinator were affected by the size of the mother tree, that is, larger mothers received pollen from a less diverse, less even pool of sires per fruit. Pollinator body size was not found to be a significant driver of pollen dispersal, indicating that both small- and large-bodied pollinators were equally important pollen dispersers at this scale. By exploring patterns of variation at the intra-fruit level, we show that conspecific density and tree size significantly impact multi-paternal pollen-mediated gene flow, reinforcing the importance of investigating intraspecific, intra-individual variance in plant reproduction.",,,,"Castilla, Antonio R./A-3877-2019","Castilla, Antonio R./0000-0002-4124-738X",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3606,1744-7429,,,,NOV,2018,50,6,,,,,908,918,,10.1111/btp.12603,,,,,,,WOS:000450034100009,,,,,

Moreover, the introduction process itself has been hypothesised to act as a selective filter for traits that promote invasiveness. We tested the hypothesis that behaviours thought to promote invasivenesssuch as increased foraging activity and aggressionare selected for during invasion by comparing traits among native and introduced populations of the widespread Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). We studied Argentine ant populations in the native range in Argentina and in three invaded regions along an introduction pathway: California, Australia and New Zealand. In each region, we set up 32 experimental colonies to measure foraging activity and interspecific aggression in a subset of the study regions. These colonies were subject to experimental manipulation of carbohydrate availability and octopamine, a biogenic amine known to modulate behaviour in insects, to measure variation in behavioural plasticity. We found variation in foraging activity among populations, but this variation was not consistent with selection on behaviour in relation to the invasion process. We found that colonies with limited access to carbohydrates exhibited unchanged exploratory behaviour, but higher exploitation activity and lower aggression. Colonies given octopamine consistently increased foraging behaviour (both exploration and exploitation), as well as aggression when also sugar-deprived. There was no difference in the degree of behavioural response to our experimental treatments along the introduction pathway. We did not find support for selection of behavioural traits associated with invasiveness along the Argentine ant's introduction pathway or clear evidence for an association between the introduction process and variation in behavioural plasticity.

Evidence is emerging that sublethal doses of these neurotoxins are affecting the learning and memory of both wild and managed bee colonies, exacerbating the negative effects of pesticide exposure and reducing individual foraging efficiency. 2. Variation in methodologies and interpretation of results across studies has precluded the quantitative evaluation of these impacts that is needed to make recommendations for policy change. It is not clear whether robust effects occur under acute exposure regimes (often argued to be more field-realistic than the chronic regimes upon which many studies are based), for field-realistic dosages, and for pesticides other than neonicotinoids. 3. Here we use meta-analysis to examine the impact of pesticides on bee performance in proboscis extension-based learning assays, the paradigm most commonly used to assess learning and memory in bees. We draw together 104 (learning) and 167 (memory) estimated effect sizes across a diverse range of studies. 4. We detected significant negative effects of pesticides on learning and memory (i) at field realistic dosages, (ii) under both chronic and acute application, and (iii) for both neonicotinoid and non-neonicotinoid pesticides groups. 5. We also expose key gaps in the literature that include a critical lack of studies on non-Apis bees, on larval exposure (potentially one of the major exposure routes), and on performance in alternative learning paradigms. 6. Policy implications. Procedures for the registration of new pesticides within EU member states now typically require assessment of risks to pollinators if potential target crops are attractive to bees. However, our results provide robust quantitative evidence for subtle, sublethal effects, the consequences of which are unlikely to be detected within small-scale prelicensing laboratory or field trials, but can be critical when pesticides are used at a landscape scale.

Co-located soil and dust samples were simultaneously analysed with the objective of determining if the bees or their products had potential application as a proxy for monitoring environmental contamination. The most significant relationships were found between Pb concentrations in honey (r = 0.814, p = 0.014) and wax (r = 0.883, p = 0.004) and those in co-located dust samples. In addition, Zn concentrations in honey and soil were significantly associated (r = 0.709, p = 0.049). Lead isotopic compositions of native bee products collected from background sites adjacent to Sydney national parks ((206)pb/Pb-207 = 1.144, Pb-208/Pb-207 = 2.437) corresponded to local geogenic rock and soil values (Pb-206/Pb-207 = 1.123-1.176, Pb-208/Pb-207 = 2.413-2.500). By contrast, inner Sydney metropolitan samples, including native bees and wax (Pb-206/Pb-207 = 1.072-1.121, Pb-208/Pb-207 = 2.348-2.409), co-located soil and dust (Pb-206/Pb-207 = 1.090-1.122, Pb-208/Pb-207 = 2.368-2.403), corresponded most closely to aerosols collected during the period of leaded petrol use (Pb-206/Pb-207 = 1.067-1.148, Pb-208/Pb-207 = 2.341-2.410). A large range of Pb isotopic compositions in beehive samples suggests that other legacy sources, such as Pb-based paints and industrials, may have also contributed to Pb contamination in beehive samples. Native bee data were compared to corresponding samples from the more common European honey bee (Apis mellifera). Although Pb isotopic compositions were similar in both species, significant differences in trace element concentrations were evident across the trace element suite, the bees and their products. The statistical association between T carbonaria and co-located environmental contaminant concentrations were stronger than those in European honey bees, which may be attributable to its smaller foraging distance (0.3-0.7 km versus 5-9 km, respectively). This implies that T. carbonaria may be more suitable for assessing small spatial scale variations of trace element concentrations than European honey bees. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Bombus ephippiatus, a widespread species mostly found in mountains in the Neotropics, seems to use the highlands as island, and deforested lowland areas may represent barriers to their dispersal, leading to isolation and potentially loss of genetic diversity. Yet, lack of knowledge of its population structure does not allow adequate management and conservation. To fill this knowledge gap, we assessed the population structure and inferred dispersion of B. ephippiatus in two mountain-ranges in Guatemala (Volcanic Chain and Sierra de las Minas). This region is characterized by high topographic variation and considerable deforestation strain. We analyzed the effects of elevation and land-use on genetic differentiation of B. ephippiatus populations and inferred its demography in the region. Our results suggest that B. ephippiatus is able to disperse long distances across most landscape types, reflected by its high genetic diversity, high effective population size, considerable gene flow, low population differentiation, as well as the lack of isolation by distance. Hence, B. ephippiatus may be a resilient species for the provision of pollination services. However, we detected a subtle divergence of B. ephippiatus into two clusters, of which Sierra de las Minas has been identified as a regional hotspot of genetic and species endemism. Yet, differentiation is very recent and hence likely caused by lowland deforestation.

We examined effects of field and landscape parameters on wild bee species' richness, abundance and functional traits in Austrian vineyards over two years using Generalised Linear Mixed models, Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Random Forests. Alternating tillage was compared with no tillage in two inter-rows per vineyard. Forage availability in these inter-rows was estimated by flower coverage at each sampling date, and landscape features were analysed within a radius of 750 m around the vineyards. Across all vineyards we found 84 wild bee species with a mean abundance (+/- SD) of 29 (+/- 16.6). Forage availability had the strongest positive effect on wild bee diversity and abundance. In comparison to no tillage, alternating tillage slightly increased wild bee diversity and abundance. Eusocial wild bees were more abundant in untilled inter-rows, whereas solitary wild bees were more closely associated with alternating tilled vineyards. At the landscape scale, the percentage of artificial areas (mostly villages) and distance to semi-natural elements raised wild bee diversity and abundance. The proportion of woodland increased the abundance of wild bees, in particular of eusocial taxa. Solitary wild bee abundance was enhanced by the number of solitary trees. Pollination provided by wild bees in viticultural areas can be enhanced by maintaining a diversity of different soil management strategies to improve forage availability in vineyards.

We tested different assumptions about bumblebee species' dispersal capacities, drawing on observed patterns of range shifts to date, dispersal rates observed for bumblebee queens, and, lastly, assuming unlimited dispersal. Models show significant contractions of current ranges even under scenarios in which dispersal rates were high. Results suggest that dispersal rates may not suffice for bumblebees to track climate change as rapidly as required under any IPCC scenario for future climate change. Areas where species losses are projected overlap for many species and climate scenarios, and are concentrated in eastern parts of the continent.

Honey bees and bumble bees are eusocial central place foragers. Honey bees have large perennial colonies while bumble bee colonies are annual and considerably smaller. Foraging range, body size, and division of labor also vary between these two bee species. Honey bees use their unique dance language to recruit foragers to the most profitable patches. Bumble bees exploit patches individually and develop trapline foraging patterns. We expect such differences among bee species to engender differences in foraging activity. Moreover, variation in resource availability and in colony needs over the flowering season, can affect bee foraging activity. Finally, spatial variation in resource availability may impact bumble bees to a greater extent than honey bees due to their smaller foraging range. Using miniaturized radio frequency identification (RFID), we tracked the foraging activity of individual bees to and from hives at three sites and over five time periods. Pollen pellets were also collected from bees returning to the hive. We compared the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, and the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. Linear mixed effect models determined the impact of bee species, time of season (period) and site, and their interactions, on multiple foraging metrics calculated from the RFID data and on pollen dry weight. Relative to honey bees, individual bumble bees made more foraging trips each day, resulting in a greater time spent foraging. A greater proportion of RFID tagged bumble bees foraged each day and bumble bees brought heavier pollen sacs to the hive compared to honey bees. Foraging bout duration did not vary between bee species and none of the foraging metrics varied among time periods or among sites. Both bee species brought heavier pollen sacs back to the hive at the beginning and the end of the flowering season.

We tested whether changes in the density of neighborhood conspecific and heterospecific plants and in the availability of resources influence the frequency and composition of floral and frugivorous visitors of eleven individuals of the same population of the threatened palm Euterpe edulis in Brazil. The frequency of floral visitors was positively associated with conspecific density and availability of resources. Species composition was affected by the availability of resources since some bee species were associated with palms that offered more flowers, whereas others were associated with palms that offered less. Two bee species may be able to mediate long-distance pollen-flow for E. edulis: an undetermined species of Euglossini and Apis mellifera. Frugivorous birds were not influenced by any of the factors investigated. Birds of the genus Turdus predominated in the assemblage and were responsible for most of the interactions. This is probably due to the fact that, unlike larger birds, species of Turdus are considered resilient to environmental disturbances. Due to the continuous defaunation and fragmentation of the Atlantic Forest, the number of large birds that can promote long-distance seed dispersal is declining, with implications for the genetic diversity of E. edulis. Measures to restore the population density of E. edulis will likely favor the recovery of its genetic diversity due to its high capacity for distant pollen dispersal.

Here, we describe an experimental study to determine the fitness consequences of phenological shifts in blue orchard bee (Osmia lignaria) emergence, compare the measured seasonal fitness landscape with observed phenology in the unmanipulated population, and assess seasonal variation in key factors related to reproduction, foraging, and brood parasitism that were expected to affect the shape of the fitness landscape. By tracking individually marked females, we were able to estimate the lifetime fitness impacts of phenological advances and delays. We also measured parasitism risk, floral resource use, and nesting behavior to understand how each varies seasonally, and their combined effects on realized fitness. Survival to nesting decreased non-monotonically throughout the season, with a 20.4% decline in survival rates between the first and second cohorts. The total reproductive output per maternal bee was 14.9% higher in the second cohort compared to the first, and 161% higher in the second cohort compared to the third. Combining seasonal patterns in survival and reproductive output, experimentally advanced females showed 30.6% higher fitness than bees released at the historic peak. In contrast, the nesting phenology of unmanipulated bees showed nearly equal numbers of nesting attempts in the first two cohorts. Both increased resource availability and reduced parasitism risk favored earlier emergence. These results are consistent with a population experiencing directional selection for earlier emergence, adaptive bet-hedging, or developmental constraints.

Male flowers provide pollen rewards for an extended period of time while female flowers are rewardless and both sexes are visited by generalist insects, mainly by honeybees and stingless bees. Bee visits were significantly more frequent and longer on male than on female flowers as bees collected pollen from male flowers. We found that flower production patterns create a preponderance of males compared to females in the swamp populations. Using a model of honeybee color vision, we found the distance between the color loci of male and female flowers and based on minimum visual angle subtended by these flowers, we suggest that the two floral sexes cannot be discriminated by bees.

Its flowers were visited by a wide range of insects, most of which served as pollinators. The most frequent pollen bearers were (in decreasing order): the cricket Homoeoxipha lycoides, stingless bees of the Tetragonula testaceitarsis/hirashimai complex, hoverflies of subfam. Syrphinae, the wasp Polybioides gracilis and sweat bees of subfam. Halictinae. We found no evidence of a link between the rheophytic habit of E. flava and its pollinator fauna.

Hence, we suggest that dual pollination systems contribute to the opportunist strategy of E. flava, and we discuss, in a phylogenetic framework, how the strategy fits in with those previously reported for Epipactis sect.

Within this context, the present study sought to assess how wild bee assemblages affect the yield of Brassica napus at three different distances (25 m, 175 m and 325 m) from forest remnants in Southern Brazil. Pan traps were employed to sample bees, and data analysis was carried out using the Shannon diversity index and generalized linear models. We identified 11 species of native bees, both solitary and social, and high prevalence of the exotic species Apis mellifera L. Our findings show that canola crop yield was positively influenced by the diversity of bee species, demonstrating that native bees, not only A. mellifera, can greatly contribute to the productivity of canola crops. In addition, it was found that bee body size is significantly associated with flight distance travelled within the canola fields, and indicated a relationship with nesting sites. Thus, we hypothesize that higher canola yields are associated with increased presence of wild bee species, both social and solitary, and that maintenance of these pollinators is directly related to practices adopted in rural areas, whether within crop fields or in forest remnants used as nesting sites by wild bees.",,,,/B-9412-2014; /F-8617-2012; /AAD-2347-2020,/0000-0001-8452-1716; /0000-0001-5181-2461; /0000-0001-5181-2461,,,,,,,,,,,,0361-6525,,,,,OCT,2018,65,4,,,SI,,751,759,,10.13102/sociobiology.v65i4.3467,,,,,,,WOS:000450550200026,,,,,

They are also dependent on forested environments which are essential to maintaining their diversity and pollination services. We analysed bee diversity in forest patches and adjacent open areas to evaluate if bees can use complementary environments in heterogeneous altered tropical landscapes. The effect of landscape level heterogeneity and forest amount on bee diversity was also assessed. Our hypothesis was that bee communities will be richer and more diverse in highly forested and heterogeneous landscapes when compared to areas dominated by few human-made environments, but due to supplementary foraging behaviors, they will be more abundant in open areas where flower availability is higher. We actively sampled bees visiting flowers within forest patches and in surrounding open areas between the Cantareira and Mantiqueira mountain ranges in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We found both higher bee richness and diversity in open areas than in forest patches, partially denying our initial hypothesis but supporting that bees are more abundant in open areas. We found strong indication that landscapes with a higher amount of forest and environmental heterogeneity can provide more resources for bees through resource complementation processes, maintaining their diversity in the landscape.

However, city planners often lack knowledge to identify how well different parts of the green infrastructure are connected, and tools to estimate the accessibility to important habitats for different species in urban areas are strongly needed. We compared the ability of three measures of available food resources, with increasing complexity, for explaining species richness and abundance of bees and wasps at 23 locations in an urban landscape in Sweden. Specifically, we tested (1) the summed amount of food habitat within a buffer circle, (2) the amount of food habitat weighted by distance, and (3) the summed amount of food habitat within an area created by cost-weighted distance based on the surrounding landscape friction. We tested two spatial scales (200 and 400 m). The results show that both the summed (1) and the weighted measures (2) were very poor in explaining species richness and abundance regardless of spatial scale, while we found significant relationships for both species richness and abundance with the friction-based measure (3) at both scales. For the friction-based measure, the relationships with both response variables were strongest at the smallest spatial scale (200 m). We conclude that bees and wasps are sensitive to barriers such as large roads and built-up areas when foraging in urban environments.

H.",,,The prevalence of olfactory- versus visual-signal encounter by searching bumblebees,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,,,,,,,,,,,,"While the phrase 'foraging bumblebee' brings to mind a bumbling bee flying flower to flower in a sunny meadow, foraging is a complicated series of behaviors such as: locating a floral patch; selecting a flower-type; learning handling skills for pollen and nectar extraction; determining when to move-on from a patch; learning within-patch paths (traplining); and learning efficient hive-to-patch routes (spatial navigation). Thus the term 'forager' encompasses multiple distinct behaviors that rely on different sensory modalities. Despite a robust literature on bumblebee foraging behavior, few studies are directly relevant to sensory-guided search; i.e. how workers locate novel patches. The first step in answering this question is to determine what sensory information is available to searching bumblebees. This manuscript presents a computational model that elucidates the relative frequency of visual and olfactory cues that are available to workers searching for floral resources under a range of ecologically relevant scenarios. Model results indicate that odor is the most common sensory cue encountered during search flights. When the likelihood of odor-plume contact is higher, odor-encounter is ubiquitous. While integrative (visual + olfactory) cues are common when foragers are searching for larger flowers (e.g. Echinacea), they become rare when foragers are searching for small flowers (e.g. Penstemon). Visual cues are only encountered in isolation when foragers are seeking large flowers with a low odorplume contact probability. These results indicate that despite the multisensory nature of floral signals, different modalities may be encountered in isolation during search-behavior, as opposed to the reliably multimodal signals encountered during patch-exploitation or nectar/ pollen acquisition.",,,,"ARSLAN, Okan/AAA-3232-2020","Sprayberry, Jordanna/0000-0002-6974-5735",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,Oct-01,2018,8,,,,,,,,14590,10.1038/s41598-018-32897-y,,,,,,,WOS:000446117800011,30275496,,,,

Conversely, introduced biotically pollinated plants might facilitate improved pollinator services to native plants by supporting higher pollinator densities and extending the flowering season. We examined weekly pollinator visitation to native and introduced plants, at five elevations over two flowering seasons on The Remarkables range, south-central South Island, New Zealand. In this area, introduced plants dominate the vegetation at lower elevations but are restricted to disturbed areas above treeline. We tested whether pollinator visitation rates and quantities of introduced pollen on insects or transferred to native flowers differed with elevation and community context, or with the local abundance of introduced flowers regardless of elevation. Introduced biotically pollinated plants produced more flowers and flowered later than most native species and were extensively utilised by native solitary bees. Weekly visitation rates to native flowers were higher in the first half of the flowering season than the second half, and were positively correlated with visitation rates to co-occurring introduced flowers. Introduced flower abundance did not affect visitation to native flowers but did significantly predict the occurrence of introduced pollen on native insects and stigmas of native flowers. Pollen contamination was also higher in the latter part of the flowering season. While an increase in introduced flowers at high elevations may benefit native pollinators by increasing the quantity and duration of floral resources available, the heavy use of introduced flowers by native bees will lead to at least localised stigma contamination, particularly for late flowering species. However, more information is required on foraging ranges of native pollinators and pollen limitation in native species to understand the consequences of introduced species expansion into alpine areas.",,,,"Lord, Janice Marjorie/A-8869-2012","Lord, Janice Marjorie/0000-0001-8314-0428; Barratt, Barbara I.P./0000-0002-8424-8729",,,,,,,,,,,,1664-2201,1664-221X,,,,OCT,2018,128,2,,,,,179,189,,10.1007/s00035-018-0206-5,,,,,,,WOS:000444944000007,,,,,

In this study, we present a practical scheme for processing confocal microscope images and reconstructing neuronal structures. We evaluated this scheme using image data samples and associated ""gold standard"" reconstructions from the BigNeuron Project. In these samples, dendritic arbors belonging to multiple projection branches of the same neuron overlapped in space, making it difficult to automatically and accurately trace their structural connectivity. Our proposed scheme, which combines several software tools for image masking and filtering with an existing tool for dendritic segmentation and tracing, outperformed state-of-the-art automatic methods in reconstructing such neuron structures.

Here, we use novel lightweight atmospheric pressure loggers to monitor group dynamics in a small migratory bird, the European bee-eater (Merops apiaster). We present the first evidence of a migratory bird flying together with non-kin of different ages and sexes at all stages of the life cycle. In fact, 49% stay together throughout the annual cycle, never separating longer than 5 days at a time despite the similar to 14,000-km journey. Of those that separated for longer, 89% reunited within less than a month with individuals they had previously spent time with, having flown up to 5,000 km apart.

Species as diverse as rats, bees, and crabs achieve this by integrating all changes of direction with the distance covered during their foraging trips, a process called path integration. They generate an estimate of their current position relative to a starting point, enabling a straight-line return, following what is known as a home vector. While in theory path integration always leads the animal precisely back home, in the real world noise limits the usefulness of this strategy when operating in isolation. Noise results from stochastic processes in the nervous system and from unreliable sensory information, particularly when obtaining heading estimates. Path integration, during which angular self-motion provides the sole input for encoding heading (idiothetic path integration), results in accumulating errors that render this strategy useless over long distances. In contrast, when using an external compass this limitation is avoided (allothetic path integration). Many navigating insects indeed rely on external compass cues for estimating body orientation, whereas they obtain distance information by integration of steps or optic flow-based speed signals. In the insect brain, a region called the central complex plays a key role for path integration. Not only does the central complex house a ring-attractor network that encodes head directions, neurons responding to optic flow also converge with this circuit. A neural substrate for integrating direction and distance into a memorized home vector has therefore been proposed in the central complex. We discuss how behavioral data and the theoretical framework of path integration can be aligned with these neural data.",,,,"Heinze, Stanley/I-4440-2019","Heinze, Stanley/0000-0002-8145-3348; Narendra, Ajay/0000-0002-1286-5373",,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,1879-0445,,,,Sep-10,2018,28,17,,,,,R1043,R1058,,10.1016/j.cub.2018.04.058,,,,,,,WOS:000444190900032,30205054,,,,

In decentralized systems in which individuals use local cues to decide how to allocate their time amongst multiple tasks, a ""global"" signal detectable over large distances by all members of the group could have a profound effect on task allocation and coordination. Honeybees provide a unique opportunity to study how information transfer modulates behavior because they produce pheromones that can regulate the actions of thousands of individuals in a colony. We used electrophysiological and behavioral assays to compare the transmission modes of 2 larval pheromones to test the hypothesis that larval pheromones can act as ""global"" signals by rapidly regulating behavior throughout a colony without direct physical interactions between individuals. By studying mechanisms of pheromone transmission at the individual and colony level, we provide evidence that larval pheromones act as direct rapid and powerful regulators of behavior, even among individuals too far away from each other to use visual or tactile cues.

We observed multiple instances of E. tuberculatum ambushing and successfully capturing the hovering and standing guards of T. angustula near nest entrances. The unique hovering behavior of the guard caste of this bee species, an adaptation to frequent cleptoparasitism by other stingless bees, may make these guards particularly vulnerable to ground-based, ambush attacks by E. tuberculatum.

We tested how connectivity, time since restoration, and species traits influence if species that are present in the surrounding landscape also occur in restored pastures. Solitary bee species present in the landscape were less likely to occur in restored pastures compared to bumblebees and hoverflies.

Migratory hoverflies were more likely to occur in restored pastures than nonmigratory hoverflies, especially in pastures with low connectivity. Among both bumblebees and solitary bees, the occurrence was influenced by nesting traits, with the lowest occurrence of parasitic species and of species digging nests in the ground. The subset of the landscape's species pool that occurs in restored pastures has a contrasting set of traits compared with species in intact source habitats.

We also investigated whether the exploratory components of re-orientation flights differ from foraging flights and if so how. We recorded re-orientation flights using harmonic radar technology and compared the patterns and flight parameters of these flights with the first exploratory orientation flights of young honeybees and foraging flights of experienced foragers. Just as exploratory orientation flights of young honeybees, re-orientation flights can be classified into short- and long-range flights, and most short-range re-orientation flights were performed under unfavorable weather conditions. This indicates that bees adapt the flight pattern of their re-orientation and orientation flights to changing weather conditions in a similar way. Unlike exploratory orientation flights, more than one sector of the landscape was explored during a long-range re-orientation flight, and significantly longer flight durations and flight distances were observed. Thus, re-orienting bees explored a larger terrain than bees performing their first exploratory orientation flight. By displacing some bees after their first re-orientation flight, we could demonstrate that a single re-orientation flight seems to be sufficient to learn the new location of the hive.

To investigate if such exposure is detrimental to bees, many studies have exclusively fed individuals with pesticide-spiked food, informing us about the hazard but not necessarily the risk of exposure. While such studies are important to establish the physiological and behavioural effects on individuals, they do not consider the possibility that the risk of exposure may change over time. For example, many pesticide assays exclude potential behavioural adaptations to novel toxins, such as rejection of harmful compounds by choosing to feed on an uncontaminated food source, thus behaviourally lowering the risk of exposure. In this paper, we conducted an experiment over 10 days in which bumblebees could forage on an array of sucrose feeders containing 0, 2 and 11 parts per billion of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam. This more closely mimics pesticide exposure in the wild by allowing foraging bees to (i) experience a field realistic range of pesticide concentrations across a chronic exposure period, (ii) have repeated interactions with the pesticide in their environment, and (iii) retain the social cues associated with foraging by using whole colonies. We found that the proportion of visits to pesticide-laced feeders increased over time, resulting in greater consumption of pesticide-laced sucrose relative to untreated sucrose. After changing the spatial position of each feeder, foragers continued to preferentially visit the pesticide-laced feeders which indicates that workers can detect thiamethoxam and alter their behaviour to continue feeding on it. The increasing preference for consuming the neonicotinoid-treated food therefore increases the risk of exposure for the colony during prolonged pesticide exposure. Our results highlight the need to incorporate attractiveness of pesticides to foraging bees (and potentially other insect pollinators) in addition to simply considering the proportion of pesticide-contaminated floral resources within the foraging landscape.",,,,"Wurm, Yannick/A-9525-2009","Wurm, Yannick/0000-0002-3140-2809; Gill, Richard/0000-0001-9389-1284; Colgan, Thomas/0000-0002-0547-8228; Arce, Andres/0000-0002-3577-2110",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,Aug-29,2018,285,1885,,,,,,,20180655,10.1098/rspb.2018.0655,,,,,,,WOS:000443163500004,30158303,,,,

Here, we subjected larvae and freshly hatched workers of the clonal ant Platythyrea punctata to different rearing conditions and investigated how these manipulations affected division of labour among pairs of oppositely treated, same-aged clonemates. High rearing temperature, physical stress, injury and malnutrition increased the propensity of individuals to become subordinate foragers rather than dominant reproductives. This is reflected in changed gene regulation: early stages of division of labour were associated with different expression of genes involved in nutrient signalling pathways, metabolism and the phenotypic response to environmental stimuli. Many of these genes appear to be capable of responding to a broad range of stressors.

Yet few studies of pollinator-mediated processes in plants have considered the effects of variation in individual foraging patterns on plant reproductive success. In this study, we use an individual-based model of pollinator foraging economics to predict how visitation rates and pollination success of two coflowering plant species change with their frequency (relative abundance). Whereas previous studies suggested that adaptive foraging of pollinators always favors pollination of abundant plant species (positive frequency dependence), here we show that under certain conditions the per capita pollination success of a rare plant species can exceed that of a more abundant species. Specifically, when the overall flower density is sufficiently high and pollinators' perception ranges are sufficiently large, animals with limited memory of previously encountered rewards forage in a way that favors pollination of the rarer plant species. Moreover, even with perfectly informed foragers, a rare plant species benefits more from offering a higher floral reward than a more abundant species. Our results show that adaptive foraging of individual pollinators can have important implications for plant community dynamics and the persistence of rare plant species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,AUG,2018,192,2,,,,,E81,E92,,10.1086/697582,,,,,,,WOS:000438972600003,30016159,,,,

Increasing habitat that provides forage and nesting sites could boost struggling populations, particularly in urban, suburban and agricultural landscapes. The millions of acres beneath aerial electric transmission lines, sometimes referred to as easements or rights-of-way, must be kept free of tall-growing vegetation and hence have the potential to provide suitable habitat for many native species. Prior work has demonstrated that bee communities in easements managed using alternatives to episodic mowing were more diverse than in nearby open areas, however true control sites within the easements were unavailable. In order to compare vegetation management protocols, we conducted a two-year study which enabled us to directly compare transmission line easements in three locations currently undergoing Integrated Vegetation Management-a dynamic form of management involving spot removal and herbicide treatment of unwanted species (treatment) with nearby sites undergoing standard management protocols of yearly or biyearly mowing (control). Results show that treatment sites had significantly higher abundance and species richness than controls. Seasonal differences were pronounced, with the spring fauna most affected by differences in vegetation management. In addition, the older treatment sites house more social bees, more parasitic species and a more even distribution of bees across nesting guilds. Finally, we established that treatment sites had distinct bee communities, further increasing their value as sources for native bee populations in the landscape.

Resource pulses, narrow periods of high resource availability, can elicit strong behavioural responses across diverse taxa. Mass-flowering agricultural crops are an example of a resource pulse that insect pollinators exploit. However, the underlying mechanism behind changes in pollinator behaviour associated with mass-flowering crops is still relatively unexplored. 2. The present study quantified the behavioural response of bumble bees, an important wild pollinator, to commercial cranberry bloom, an important mass-flowering crop in Wisconsin, U.S.A. Over a 2-year period, foraging trip duration was measured using radio frequency identification at 14 farms situated across landscape contexts, ranging from high to low natural area (woodland amount). Using transect surveys, floral resource abundance at a landscape scale was estimated. 3. It was found that bumble bees were highly sensitive to temporal changes in landscape-level resource abundance associated with the onset of cranberry bloom, during which they decreased foraging trip duration by 22% and increased the number of foraging trips during bloom by 24% on average relative to the period before and after bloom. This phenomenon was consistent across colonies, individual bees, and landscape contexts, despite a higher abundance of flowers in low woodland landscapes. Bumble bee colonies growing in low- and high-woodland landscapes exhibited a similar performance. 4. As mass-flowering crops are probably a factor influencing bumble bee foraging behaviour in agricultural regions, investigations should continue into how variable resource landscapes, particularly those offering resource pulses, affect wild pollinators and the pollination services they provide.",,,,,"Hemberger, Jeremy/0000-0003-3648-4724",,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,1365-2311,,,,AUG,2018,43,4,,,,,447,457,,10.1111/een.12516,,,,,,,WOS:000437112200006,,,,,

In vespids, which are mostly predators, the foraging range of workers determines their maximum predation pressure round the nest. One of these species, Vespa velutina, a recently invasive species introduced into Europe, exerts a strong predation on honeybees at the hive. Therefore, the definition of its activity rhythm and spatial range of predation is of primary importance. Using radio frequency identification tags (RFID), two experiments were carried out to (a) determine their return ability (called homing) in releasing 318 individuals at different distance from their colony and (b) monitor their foraging activity rhythm and the duration of their flights based on 71 individuals followed 24hr/24 during 2months. The homing ability of V.velutina was evaluated to be up to 5,000m and was not affected by the cardinal orientation of release point. The lag time to return to the nest increased with the distance of release. Most of the flight activity took place between 07:00a.m. and 08:00p.m., hornets doing principally short flights of less than an hour. Foraging range was thus estimated ca. 1,000m around the nest.

In this study, we examine the effect of Quaternary climate instability on population genetic variability of a bumble bee pollinator species, Bombus huntii in western North America. Pleistocene and contemporary B.huntii habitat suitability (HS) was estimated with an environmental niche model (ENM) by associating 1,035 locality records with 10 bioclimatic variables. To estimate genetic variability, we genotyped 380 individuals from 33 localities at 13 microsatellite loci. Bayesian inference was used to examine population structure with and without a priori specification of geographic locality. We compared isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by resistance (IBR) models to examine population differentiation within and among the Bayesian inferred genetic clusters. Furthermore, we tested for the effect of environmental niche stability (ENS) on population genetic diversity with linear regression. As predicted, high-latitude B.huntii habitats exhibit low ENS when compared to low-latitude habitats. Two major genetic clusters of B.huntii inhabit western North America: (a) a north genetic cluster predominantly distributed north of 28 degrees N and (b) a south genetic cluster distributed south of 28 degrees N. In the south genetic cluser, both IBD and IBR models are significant. However, in the north genetic cluster, IBD is significant but not IBR. Furthermore, the IBR models suggest that low-latitude montane populations are surrounded by habitat with low HS, possibly limiting dispersal, and ultimately gene flow between populations. Finally, we detected high genetic diversity across populations in regions that have been climatically unstable since the last glacial maximum (LGM), and low genetic diversity across populations in regions that have been climatically stable since the LGM.

Urbanophobic families were most affected by the proportion of impervious areas when it was estimated within buffers of 200-m to 1400-m radii, depending on the family. Notable losses of urbanophobic families were detected at less than 50% of impervious areas, which highlights the threat to the diversity of flower-feeding insects posed by urban sprawl. Corolla shape variables were the variables most often significantly implicated in the occurrence of insect families.

We found lower taxonomic diversity of bees visiting flowers of trees in small rainforest fragments compared with large forest fragments and show that bee species in small fragments were subsets of species in larger fragments. Bees visiting trees in small fragments also had higher mean body sizes than those in larger fragments, suggesting that small-sized bees may be less likely to persist in small fragments. Lastly, we found reductions in the abundance of eusocial stingless bees visiting flowers in small fragments compared to large fragments.

Honey bee colonies also have a yearly life cycle that might generate nutritional requirements that differ between times of brood rearing and colony expansion in the spring and population contraction and preparation for overwintering in the fall. To test this, we analyzed polyfioral mixes of spring and fall pollens to determine if the nutrient composition differed with season. Next, we fed both types of seasonal pollens to bees reared in spring and fall. We compared the development of brood food glands (i.e., hypopharyngeal glands - HPG), and the expression of genes in the fat body between bees fed pollen from the same (in-season) or different season (out-of-season) when they were reared. Because pathogen challenges often heighten the effects of nutritional stress, we infected a subset of bees with Nosema to determine if bees responded differently to the infection depending on the seasonal pollen they consumed. We found that spring and fall pollens were similar in total protein and lipid concentrations, but spring pollens had higher concentrations of amino and fatty acids that support HPG growth and brood production. Bees responded differently when fed in vs. out of season pollen. The HPG of both uninfected and Nosema-infected spring bees were larger when they were fed spring (in-season) compared to fall pollen. Spring bees differentially regulated more than 200 genes when fed in- vs. out-of-season pollen. When infected with Nosema, approximately 400 genes showed different infection-induced expression patterns in spring bees depending on pollen type. In contrast, HPG size in fall bees was not affected by pollen type, though HPG were smaller in those infected with Nosema. Very few genes were differentially expressed with pollen type in uninfected (4 genes) and infected fall bees (5 genes). Pollen type did not affect patterns of infection-induced expression in fall bees. Our data suggest that physiological responses to seasonal pollens differ between bees reared in the spring and fall with spring bees being significantly more sensitive to pollen type especially when infected with Nosema. This study provides evidence that seasonal pollens may provide levels of nutrients that align with the activities of honey bees during their yearly colony cycle. The findings are important for the planning and establishment of forage plantings to sustain honey bees, and in the development of seasonal nutritional supplements fed to colonies when pollen is unavailable.",,,,,"Corby-Harris, Vanessa/0000-0001-7680-0328; Gage, Stephanie/0000-0001-6080-0921",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1910,1879-1611,,,,AUG-SEP,2018,109,,,,,,114,124,,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.07.002,,,,,,,WOS:000442704600013,29990468,,,,

We used high-throughput sequencing of 164 pollen samples extracted from the brood cells of six common cavity-nesting solitary bee species (Osmia bicornis, Osmia caerulescens, Megachile versicolor, Megachile ligniseca, Megachile centuncularis and Hylaeus confusus) which are widely distributed across the UK and Europe. We documented their pollen use across 19 farms in southern England, UK, revealing their forage plants and examining the structure of their pollen transport networks. Of the 32 plant species included currently in sown wildflower mixes, 15 were recorded as present within close foraging range of the bees on the study farms, but only Ranunculus acris L. was identified within the pollen samples. Rosa canina L. was the most commonly found of the 23 plant species identified in the pollen samples, suggesting that, in addition to providing a nesting resource for Megachile leafcutter bees, it may be an important forage plant for these species. Higher levels of connectance and nestedness were characteristic of pollen transport networks on farms with abundant floral resources, which may increase resilience to species loss. Our data suggest that plant species promoted currently by agri-environment schemes are not optimal for solitary bee foraging.

We investigated the response of foragers to a leg pinch applied before, during or after cold-anaesthesia. As expected, bees pinched at the hive entrance all responded defensively, while anaesthetised bees showed no response. When the pinch was applied after the bees recovered from cold-narcosis, all individuals were defensive, suggesting that previous cooling had not impaired nociception. We then subjected two groups of bees to a continuous pinch, commencing either before or during cold anaesthesia. Interestingly, most of these bees did not show defensive behaviour once awake, even though the clip was still attached to their leg. Chilling only lead to a diminished defensive response if the nociceptive stimulus was continuous rather than momentary, which suggests that it is not the chilling on its own, but the duration of the pinch in combination with cold narcosis that is critical.

Therefore, there is a strong need to exploit monitoring systems for airborne PM able to provide accurate information on the potential health hazards and the specific emission sources for the implementation of adequate control strategies. The honey bee (Apis mellifera, L.) is widely used as an indicator of environmental pollution: this social hymenopteran strongly interacts with vegetables, air, soil, and water surrounding the hive and, as a consequence, pollutants from these sources are translated to the insect and to the hive products.

In the present research, PM contaminating forager bees living nearby a cement factory and several kilometers away from it has been analysed and characterised morphologically, dimensionally and chemically through SEM/EDX.

We conducted pollinator observations in 52 green areas throughout the city and collected data on patch size, floral abundance, plant richness, location type, and percent vegetation at five spatial scales. Results: Of the 18,793 pollinators observed, over 98% were bees. Both patch size and floral abundance generally had positive effects on pollinators, although there was a significant interaction between the two factors; these findings were generally consistent across all focal taxa (Tetragonula stingless bees, Apis honey bees, Xylocopa carpenter bees, and butterflies). Discussion: Our results demonstrate the importance of maintaining large green areas in cities, since small green areas supported few pollinators, even when floral resources were abundant. Moreover, most pollinator taxa utilized a variety of location types (e.g., public parks, school campuses, temple grounds), with the exception of butterflies, which preferred parks. Our findings are generally consistent with those of temperate urban studies, but additional studies in the tropics are needed before global patterns can be assessed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,Jul-20,2018,6,,,,,,,,e5335,10.7717/peerj.5335,,,,,,,WOS:000439652200014,30042902,,,,

Microsatellite-based parentage analysis provides accurate estimates of contemporary gene dispersal. Although most tropical trees have been shown to exhibit widespread pollen dispersal, few studies have estimated contemporary gene dispersal after seedling establishment. Bertholletia excelsa (Lecythidaceae) is pollinated by large-bodied bees, while previous seed-tracking experiments suggest their seeds are mainly dispersed across very short distances by scatter-hoarding rodents, who primarily act as seed predators. Here we used parentage analysis to provide contemporary estimates of pollen and seed dispersal in B. excelsa recruits. We examined six 25-ha plots located in two natural stands in the Acre River valley, in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. We used 11 microsatellite markers to estimate genetic diversity and fixation index parameters in adults, seedlings and saplings. Genetic diversity was moderate and did not differ across size classes or sampling locations. We assigned pollen and seed parents for < 20% of the recruits, indicating that most events of realized gene flow occurred beyond our 25-ha plots. Only 10 parentage assignments were confirmed with 80% confidence. Pollen distance ranged from 33 to 372 m and seed dispersal from 58 to 655 m. Actual seed-dispersal distances were far greater than the estimates obtained in previous seed-tracking experiments.

Such trait changes may drastically alter the outcome of pollination mutualisms on plants; however, the direct role of fire on these mutualisms is poorly known. METHODS: Following a pair of fires in the northern California coast range chaparral, we censused floral visitor communities of Trichostema laxum (Lamiaceae), quantified visiting bee behavior, and estimated outcrossing rates using a widespread Mendelian recessive floral polymorphism across a matrix of populations in burned and unburned sites. We also compared pre- and postfire floral visitation in two populations. RESULTS: Outcrossing rates were significantly lower in burned areas; however, our data suggest that the much larger size of plants in burned areas, not burn status itself, drove this pattern. Large-bodied bees dominated floral visitor communities after fire, likely recruiting to the abundant postfire floral resources. These bees visited more flowers per plant than did the smaller bees prevalent before fire and in unburned areas, likely increasing selfing through geitonogamy (within-plant pollination), an effect made possible by the far larger size of plants in burned areas. CONCLUSIONS: Outcrossing rates dropped substantially after wildfires because of changes in the pollinators, plant display size, and their interactions. Reductions in outcrossing following fire may have important implications for population resilience and evolution in a changing climate with more frequent fires.",,,,,"LoPresti, Eric/0000-0002-5622-0278; Mola, John/0000-0002-5394-9071",,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9122,1537-2197,,,,JUL,2018,105,7,,,,,1154,1164,,10.1002/ajb2.1129,,,,,,,WOS:000441289100006,30047984,,,,

The risk of exposure to fungicide residues is likely to be especially high if the spray occurs on, or near host plants while the bees are collecting pollen to provision their nests. For species of Osmia that consume pollen from a select group of plants (oligolecty), the inability to use pollen from non-host plants can increase their risk factor for fungicide-related toxicity. This manuscript describes protocols used to successfully rear oligolectic mason bees, Osmia ribifloris sensu lato, from egg to prepupal stage within cell culture plates under standardized laboratory conditions. The in vitro-reared bees are subsequently used to investigate the effects of fungicide exposure and pollen source on bee fitness. Based on a 2 x 2 fully crossed factorial design, the experiment examines the main and interactive effects of fungicide exposure and pollen source on larval fitness, quantified by prepupal biomass, larval developmental time, and survivorship. A major advantage of this technique is that using in vitro-reared bees reduces natural background variability and allows the simultaneous manipulation of multiple experimental parameters.

Declining pollinator populations have caused concern about consequences for food production, and have initiated an increasing number of initiatives that aim to mitigate pollinator loss through enhancement of floral resources. Studies evaluating effects of mitigation measures generally demonstrate positive responses of pollinators to floral resource enhancement. However, it remains unclear whether this represents landscape-level population effects or results from a spatial redistribution of individuals from otherwise unaffected populations. 2. Here, we present a method for estimating landscape-level population effects using data from commonly used standardized pollinator transect surveys. The approach links local density responses of pollinators in both mitigation sites and surrounding landscape elements to the area these habitats occupy in mitigation landscapes as well as control landscapes to obtain landscape-level population estimates. 3. We demonstrate the method using data from a 2-year study examining the effects of experimental wildflower enhancements on wild bumblebees and solitary bees in Dutch agricultural landscapes. The results show that conclusions based on local responses may differ significantly from those based on landscape-level responses. 4. Wildflower enhancements significantly enhanced landscape-level abundance of both bumblebees and solitary bees. Bumblebees showed a pronounced positive local density response in mitigation sites and the surrounding landscape that was in line with significant landscape-level increases in abundance. However, solitary bees showed no local response to mitigation sites, and the landscape-level increases in abundance only became apparent when the area of bee habitat was taken into account. 5. Incorporating the area of both newly created and pre-existing pollinator habitats into effect estimates accounts for density-dependent processes such as dilution, spillover and local concentration of individuals. It, therefore, results in more reliable estimates of the response to mitigation measures of pollinators, as well as other mobile arthropod groups that are often being surveyed using transect surveys.",,,,,"Kleijn, David/0000-0003-2500-7164",,,,,,,,,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,,,JUL,2018,9,7,,,,,1727,1738,,10.1111/2041-210X.13017,,,,,,,WOS:000437838600007,,,,,

Bombus vosnesenskii, which occurs across a broader elevational range at most latitudes, exhibits little population structure while B.bifarius, which occupies a relatively narrow higher elevation niche across most latitudes, exhibits much stronger population differentiation, although gene flow in both species is best explained by isolation with environmental niche resistance.

However, the functional heterogeneity of agricultural landscapes, taking into account the different resources that habitat patches can provide to species, has rarely been studied. In this study, we explored the effect of landscape-scale nest availability provided by permanent grasslands on wild bee communities. Wild bees were sampled in 43 cereal fields in south-western France differing in the surrounding proportion of permanent grasslands. Using remote sensing tools, we measured two parameters of grassland structure known to locally influence bee nest density (slope and proportion of sparse vegetation). We found that mean slope of surrounding grasslands was the factor that most positively influenced bee richness, abundance and trait distribution in bee communities. We also found that mean slope of surrounding grasslands had a better predictive power of bee community structure than the proportion of permanent grasslands. Ground-nesting species, species with high dispersal capacities and species with a generalist diet were positively affected by the availability of sloped ground in the surrounding permanent grasslands. Only bee species with specialized flower requirements responded positively to the proportion of sparse vegetation in grasslands. Our results suggest that landscape-scale availability of nesting resources provided by grasslands affects bee communities in agricultural landscapes and can help sustain functionally diverse bee assemblages.

The demand for nectar and pollen varies during the year, with more pollen needed in spring for colony population growth and more nectar needed in summer to sustain the maximum colony size and collect surplus nectar stores for winter. Sufficient bee forage is therefore necessary to ensure a healthy bee colony. Land-use changes can reduce the availability of floral resources suitable for bees, thereby increasing the susceptibility of bees to other stressors such as disease and pesticides. In contrast, land-based management decisions to protect or plant bee forage can enhance pollen and nectar supply to bees while meeting other goals such as riparian planting for water-quality improvement. Commercial demand for honey can also put pressure on floral resources through over-crowding of hives. To help understand and manage floral resources for bees, we developed a spatial model for mapping monthly nectar and pollen production from maps of land cover. Based on monthly estimated production data we mapped potential monthly supply of nectar and pollen to a given apiary location in the landscape. This is done by summing the total production within the foraging range of the apiary while subtracting the estimated nectar converted to energy for collection. Ratios of estimated supply over theoretical hive demand may then be used to infer a potential landscape carrying capacity to sustain hives. This model framework is quantitative and spatial, utilizing estimated flight energy costs for nectar foraging. It can contribute to management decisions such as where apiaries could be placed in the landscape depending on floral resources and where nectar limited areas may be located. It can contribute to planning areas for bee protection or planting such as in riparian vegetation. This would aid managed bee health, wild pollinator protection, and honey production.

Targeting neuronal receptors, they have deleterious effects on the behaviour and physiology of many insects. Bees are exposed to these insecticides in pollen and nectar while providing pollination services to agricultural crops, and neonicotinoids have been shown to impair navigation and decrease their foraging activity. We have previously reported the effect of dietary thiamethoxam on sucrose responsiveness of young worker bees. Here, we exposed caged foragers to sublethal acute doses of clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, then tested them individually for sucrose responsiveness using standard methods. In addition, we tested the response to a range of sucrose solutions laced with neonicotinoids on bees previously unexposed to neonicotinoids. This paradigm mimics the situation where foragers would first encounter poisoned nectars varying in sugar concentration. Bees were exposed to the insecticides in the feeding solution for 24 h before testing, or in the test solutions, or both. The three compounds had a detrimental effect on responses to mid-to-high sucrose concentrations under all experimental conditions, and unexposed bees tested with laced sucrose displayed unexpected low responses to the higher sucrose concentrations tested. This attenuation of sucrose response is further evidence that neonicotinoids are multisensory disruptors, with potent actions against pollinators and other beneficial insects at first contact.",,,,"Pirk, Christian/E-4180-2010; Demares, Fabien/I-6679-2016; Demares, Fabien/X-7940-2019","Pirk, Christian/0000-0001-6821-7044; Demares, Fabien/0000-0002-2638-4247; Demares, Fabien/0000-0002-2638-4247",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1910,1879-1611,,,,JUL,2018,108,,,,,,25,30,,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.05.004,,,,,,,WOS:000436217700004,29775568,,,,

We reared colonies from wild-caught bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) queens, placed them at sites characterized by varying degrees of urbanization from inner city to rural farmland and monitored the production of sexual offspring across the entire colony cycle. Our land-use cluster analysis identified three site categories, and this categorization was a strong predictor of colony performance. Crucially, colonies in the two clusters characterized by urban development produced more sexual offspring than those in the cluster dominated by agricultural land. These colonies also reached higher peak size, had more food stores, encountered fewer parasite invasions and survived for longer.

In this study, we surveyed wild bees and quantified their nectar and pollen foraging success in a rosemary Mediterranean scrubland in southern France, under different conditions of apiary size and proximity. We found that high-density beekeeping triggers foraging competition which depresses not only the occurrence (-55%) and nectar foraging success (-50%) of local wild bees but also nectar (-44%) and pollen (-36%) harvesting by the honeybees themselves. Overall, those competition effects spanned distances of 600-1.100 m around apiaries, i.e. covering 1.1-3.8 km(2) areas. Regardless the considered competition criterion, setting distance thresholds among apiaries appeared more tractable than setting colony density thresholds for beekeeping regulation. Moreover, the intraspecific competition among the honeybees has practical implications for beekeepers. It shows that the local carrying capacity has been exceeded and raises concerns for honey yields and colony sustainability. It also offers an effective ecological criterion for pragmatic decision-making whenever conservation practitioners envision progressively reducing beekeeping in protected areas.

Further insight into the temporal relationships of pollinators and their flowering partners is required to inform conservation efforts. Here we examined the phenology of British: (i) pollinator activity; (ii) insect-pollinated plant flowering; and (iii) extinct and endangered pollinator and plant species. Over 1 million records were collated from the historical databases of three British insect monitoring organisations, a global biodiversity database and an authoritative text covering the national flora. Almost two-thirds (62%) of pollinator species have peak flight observations during late-summer (July and August). This was the case across three of the groups studied: aculeate wasps (71% of species), bees (60%), and butterflies (72%), the exception being hoverflies (49%). When species geographical range (a proxy for abundance) was accounted for, a clear late-summer peak was clear across all groups. By contrast, there is marked temporal partitioning in the flowering of the major plant groups: insect-pollinated tree species blossoming predominantly during May (74%), shrubs in June (69%), and herbs in July (83%). There was a positive correlation between the number of pollinator species on the wing and the richness of both flowering insect pollinated herbs and trees/shrubs species, per calendar month. In addition, significantly greater extinctions occurred in late-summer-flying pollinator species than expected (83% of extinct species vs. 62% of all species). This trend was driven primarily by bee extinctions (80% vs. 60%) and was not apparent in other groups. We contend that this is principally due to declines in late-summer resource supplies, which are almost entirely provisioned by herbs, a consequence of historical land-use change.

The popularity of stingless beekeeping has resulted in large-scale anthropogenic movements of nests, sometimes from outside their native range. Colony movement has the potential to impact local populations via transfer of parasites and pathogens and gene flow across unnaturally large geographic scales. Tetragonula carbonaria is the most widespread and commonly kept stingless bee species in Australia. Concerns have been raised that large-scale artificial propagation of T. carbonaria colonies by Sydney beekeepers, from a small number of colonies that originated in south-east Queensland, may have two consequences. First, the managed population may be becoming increasingly inbred. Second, the wild population may be experiencing significant introgression of south-east Queensland genotypes, potentially diluting local adaptations to the Sydney environment and resulting in the loss of local alleles. Here we show, based on microsatellite and mitochondrial markers, that both the managed and wild Sydney populations are significantly different from the south-east Queensland population. Nonetheless there is evidence that introgression of south-east Queensland alleles is impacting the genetic structure of both wild and managed Sydney populations.

However, we do not yet know the extent to which bee habitat in the form of urban gardens might contribute to pollination services in surrounding crops. We explored whether gardens might provision pollinators to adjacent agricultural areas by sampling bees from gardens in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area, and estimating typical foraging distances in the context of commercial- and residential-scale pollination-dependent crops up to 1000 m from garden study sites. We estimate that garden bees could forage outside of the garden in which they were collected, and that when pollination-dependent crops (commercial-scale or residential-scale) are nearby, 30-50% of the garden bee community could potentially provide pollination services to adjacent crops, if urban bees readily cross boundaries and forage among habitat types. Urban gardens might thus be well-positioned to provision neighboring farms and food gardens with pollination services, or could serve as a refuge for pollinators when forage is scarce or crop management practices are inhospitable. The actual capacity of gardens to serve as a refuge for pollinators from agricultural fields depends upon the extent to which bees forage across habitat types. However, relatively little is known about the degree to which bees move among habitat patches in heterogeneous landscapes. We thus propose a research agenda that can document the extent to which gardens contribute to pollinator health and pollination services at the interface of urban, peri-urban, and rural landscapes.

Ascosphaera apis is the causative agent of the chalkbrood disease, a pathology affecting honey bee larvae that significantly harms population growth and colony productivity.

Only a subset of potential pollinators, mainly large bees, learn to successfully forage on such flowers. Thus, complexity may comprise a morphological filter that restricts the range of visitors and thereby increases food intake for successful foragers. Such pollinator specialization, in turn, promotes flower constancy and reduces cross-species pollen transfer, providing fitness benefits to plants with complex flowers. Since visual signals associated with floral morphological complexity are generally honest (i.e., indicate food rewards), pollinators need to perceive and process them. Physiological studies show that bees detect distant flowers through long-wavelength sensitive photoreceptors. Bees effectively perceive complex shapes and learn the positions of contours based on their spatial frequencies. Complex flowers require long handling times by naive visitors, and become highly profitable only for experienced foragers. To explore possible pathways towards the evolution of floral complexity, we discuss cognitive mechanisms that potentially allow insects to persist on complex flowers despite low initial foraging gains, suggest experiments to test these mechanisms, and speculate on their adaptive value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1422-0067,,,,,JUN,2018,19,6,,,,,,,1681,10.3390/ijms19061681,,,,,,,WOS:000436506600136,29882762,,,,

Comprehensive quantitative methods for land classification are critical to understanding these effects, but co-option of existing human-focussed land classifications is often inappropriate for pollinator research. Here, we present a flexible GIS-based land classification protocol for pollinator research using a bottom-up approach driven by reference to pollinator ecology, with urbanization as a case study. Our multistep method involves manually generating land cover maps at multiple biologically relevant radii surrounding study sites using GIS, with a focus on identifying land cover types that have a specific relevance to pollinators. This is followed by a three-step refinement process using statistical tools: (i) definition of land-use categories, (ii) principal components analysis on the categories, and (iii) cluster analysis to generate a categorical land-use variable for use in subsequent analysis. Model selection is then used to determine the appropriate spatial scale for analysis. We demonstrate an application of our protocol using a case study of 38 sites across a gradient of urbanization in South-East England. In our case study, the land classification generated a categorical land-use variable at each of four radii based on the clustering of sites with different degrees of urbanization, open land, and flower-rich habitat. Studies of land-use effects on pollinators have historically employed a wide array of land classification techniques from descriptive and qualitative to complex and quantitative. We suggest that land-use studies in pollinator ecology should broadly adopt GIS-based multistep land classification techniques to enable robust analysis and aid comparative research.

Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) form annual colonies which must rapidly increase their worker populations to support rearing reproductive individuals before the end of the season. Therefore, colony growth and reproduction should be dependent on the quality and quantity of pollen resources in the surrounding landscape. Our previous research found that B.impatiens foraging preferences to different plant species were shaped by pollen protein:lipid nutritional ratios (P:L), with foragers preferring pollen species with a similar to 5:1 P:L ratio. In this study, we placed B.impatiens colonies in three different habitats (forest, forest edge, and valley) to determine whether pollen nutritional quality collected by the colonies differed between areas that may differ in resource abundance and diversity. We found that habitat did not influence the collected pollen nutritional quality, with colonies in all three habitats collecting pollen averaging a 4:1 P:L ratio. Furthermore, there was no difference in the nutritional quality of the pollen collected by colonies that successfully reared reproductives and those that did not. We found however, that nutritional intake, calculated as the colony-level intake rate of nutrient quantities (protein, lipid, and sugar), was strongly related to colony growth and reproductive output. Therefore, we conclude that B.impatiens colony performance is a function of the abundance of nutritionally appropriate floral resources in the surrounding landscape. Because we did not comprehensively evaluate the nutrition provided by the plant communities in each habitat, it remains to be determined how B.impatiens polylectic foraging strategies helps them select among the available pollen nutritional landscape in a variety of plant communities to obtain a balance of key macronutrients.",,,,,"Vaudo, Anthony/0000-0001-5268-5580",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,JUN,2018,8,11,,,,,5765,5776,,10.1002/ece3.4115,,,,,,,WOS:000435776600048,29938091,,,,

To halt bee declines, it is essential that conservation actions are based on a mechanistic understanding of how bee species utilize landscapes. We aimed at teasing apart how foraging resources in the landscape through the nesting season affected nesting and reproduction of a solitary bee in a farmland region. We investigated how availability of floral resources and potentially resource-rich habitats surrounding nests affected nest provisioning and reproduction in the solitary polylectic bee Osmia bicornis. The study was performed in 18 landscape sectors dominated by agriculture, but varying in agricultural intensity in terms of proportion of organic crop fields and seminatural permanent pastures. Pasture-rich sectors contained more oak (Quercus robur), which pollen analysis showed to be favored forage in early season. More oaks 100m from nests led to higher proportions of oak pollen in nest provisions and increased speed of nest construction in early season, but this effect tapered off as flowering decreased. Late-season pollen foraging was dominated by buttercup (Ranunculus spp.), common in various noncrop habitats. Foraging trips were longer with more oaks and increased further through the season. The opposite was found for buttercup. Oak and buttercup interacted to explain the number of offspring; buttercup had a positive effect only when the number of oaks was above the mean for the studied sectors. The results show that quality of complex and pasture-rich landscapes for O.bicornis depends on preserving existing and generating new oak trees. Lignose plants are key early-season forage resources in agricultural landscapes. Increasing habitat heterogeneity with trees and shrubs and promoting suitable late-flowering forbs can benefit O.bicornis and other wild bees active in spring and early summer, something which existing agri-environment schemes seldom target.",,,,,"Persson, Anna/0000-0002-2711-0344; Mazier, Florence/0000-0003-2643-0925",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,JUN,2018,8,11,,,,,5777,5791,,10.1002/ece3.4116,,,,,,,WOS:000435776600049,29938092,,,,

Semi-natural habitats and mass-flowering crops such as oilseed rape provide abundant floristic resources for bees. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influences of the spatial distribution of semi-natural habitats and oilseed rape fields on the abundance and the mean body size of a solitary bee in grasslands. We focused on a generalist mining bee, Andrena cineraria, that forages and reproduces during oilseed rape flowering. In 21 permanent grasslands of Eastern France, we captured 1 287 individuals (1 205 males and 82 females) and measured the body size of male individuals. The flower density in grasslands was quantified during bee captures (2016) and the landscape surrounding grasslands was characterized during two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). The influence of oilseed rape was tested through its distribution in the landscape during both the current year of bee sampling and the previous year. Bee abundance was positively influenced by the flower density in grasslands and by the area covered by oilseed rape around grasslands in the previous year. The mean body size of A. cineraria was explained by the interaction between flower density in the grassland and the distance to the nearest oilseed rape field in the current year: the flower density positively influenced the mean body size only in grasslands distant from oilseed rape. A. cineraria abundance and body size distribution were not affected by the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. The spatial distribution of oilseed rape fields (during both the current and the previous year) as well as the local density of grassland flowers drive both bee abundance and the mean value of an intraspecific trait (body size) in permanent grasslands. Space-time variations of bee abundance and mean body size in grasslands may have important ecological implications on plant pollination and on interspecific interactions between pollinators. Specifically, a competition between bee species for nesting sites might occur in oilseed rape rich landscapes, thus raising important conservation issues for bee species that do not benefit from oilseed rape resources.",,,,,"Van Reeth, Colin/0000-0002-7070-9838",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,May-22,2018,13,5,,,,,,,e0197684,10.1371/Journal.pone.0197684,,,,,,,WOS:000432785700036,29787595,,,,

During their foraging lives, the ants leave their underground colonies for long distances and return to their starting point with fair accuracy [1, 2]. Their incessantly running path integrator provides them with a continually updated home vector [3-5 ]. Directional input to their path integrator is provided by a visual compass based on celestial cues [6, 7]. However, as path integration is prone to cumulative errors, the ants additionally employ landmark guidance routines [8-11]. At the start of their foraging lives, they acquire the necessary landmark information by performing well-structured learning walks [12,13], including turns about their vertical body axes [14]. When Cataglyphis noda performs these pirouettes, it always gazes at the nest entrance during the longest of several short stopping phases [14]. As the small nest entrance is not visible, the ants can adjust their gaze direction only by reading out their path integrator. However, recent experiments have shown that, for adjusting the goal-centered gaze directions during learning walks, skylight cues are not required [15]. A most promising remaining compass cue is the geomagnetic field, which is used for orientation in one way or the other by a variety of animal species [16-25 ]. Here, we show that the gaze directions during the look-back-to-the-nest behavior change in a predictable way to alterations of the horizontal component of the magnetic field.

The composition of agro-ecological landscapes is thought to have important implications for the production of major crops through its effects on pollinator abundance and behaviour. 2. We explored the roles of land cover and land cover heterogeneity on bee nest distribution for the giant honeybee Apis dorsata, a key species for coffee pollination, in a complex agroforest landscape. We emphasized scaling and non-uniform effects by combining two different approaches of spatial analysis, the point-pattern analysis and surface-pattern analysis. 3. We found non-exclusive, positive effects of agroforests, forest fragments and land-cover heterogeneity on the presence and number of nests. The distribution of nests responded to habitat heterogeneity at small scale (< 100 m), forest fragments at medium scale (< 300 m) and to agroforest at larger scales (500 m to 2 km). Our multiple approaches highlight that the landscape effects were neither linear nor uniform within the study zone. Nests were consistently located in areas of medium agroforest density or medium to high forest density, but were absent where forest fragments are the most concentrated. 4. The agroforest matrix was particularly important in shaping the size of nest aggregates. Nests tended to be few when there is low tree cover at broad scale, while nests were numerous when agroforest patches are abundant within the bees'-foraging range. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study revealed that structurally complex landscapes appear to support bee populations. The spatial arrangement of different land covers affected honeybee nest distributions by providing nesting and foraging-resources across multiple scales. The results suggest that continued intensification of small forest fragments and expansion of large monospecies plantations will be deleterious to the populations of giant honeybees A. dorsata. Fragmentation of the agroforestry matrix at small scales (100s m) does not, however, appear detrimental for A. dorsata as long as sufficient diversified resources are available at the landscape scale (kms).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,MAY,2018,55,3,,,,,1230,1240,,10.1111/1365-2664.13069,,,,,,,WOS:000430059500019,,,,,

In the present study, the floral composition and diversity, flowering spectrum and availability of food resources in natural and man-made habitats in four rural municipalities in Lublin Upland, SE Poland were evaluated. The connection between pollinator-friendly biotopes was also determined and some suggestions are made on creation/supplementation of bee pastures adapted to the arable land structure in eastern Poland (mean acreage 7.65ha). RESULTSForage species richness (S) differed among vegetation types: the highest S value was found in field margins, while mixed forests represented the lowest species richness (meanstandard deviation=37.8 +/- 9.5 vs 16.5 +/- 2.3). In all habitats, the most abundant flowering was recorded in May. Then the blooming abundance decreased until a complete decline at the end of summer. The mean distance between pollinator-friendly biotopes is 2.4 +/- 1.53km, which is out of the flying range/foraging distance of most pollinators. CONCLUSIONShortages of nectar and pollen resources in the agricultural landscape of SE Poland are evident. Therefore it is assumed that the landscape structure requires support in terms of food niches for pollinators and creation/supplementation of bee pastures is necessary, e.g. six to nine patches of 0.025-0.3ha each within an area of 100ha.

In doing so, hoverflies serve a vital role as alternative pollinators, and are suggested to be the most important pollinators after bees and bumblebees. Unless the flower hoverflies are feeding from is large, they do not readily share the space with other insects, but instead opt to leave if another insect approaches. We used high-speed videography followed by 3D reconstruction of flight trajectories to quantify how female Eristalis hoverflies respond to approaching bees, wasps and two different hoverfly species. We found that, in 94% of the interactions, the occupant female left the flower when approached by another insect. We found that compared with spontaneous take-offs, the occupant hoverfly's escape response was performed at similar to 3 times higher speed (spontaneous take-off at 0.20.05 m s(-1) compared with 0.55 +/- 0.08 m s(-1) when approached by another Eristalis). The hoverflies tended to take off upward and forward, while taking the incomer's approach angle into account. Intriguingly, we found that, when approached by wasps, the occupant Eristalis took off at a higher speed and when the wasp was further away. This suggests that feeding hoverflies may be able to distinguish these predators, demanding impressive visual capabilities. Our results, including quantification of the visual information available before occupant take-off, provide important insight into how freely behaving hoverflies perform escape responses from competitors and predators (e.g. wasps) in the wild.",,,,,"Wardill, Trevor/0000-0002-2049-113X; Nordstrom, Karin/0000-0002-6020-6348",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,MAY,2018,221,10,,,,,,,UNSP jeb177162,10.1242/jeb.177162,,,,,,,WOS:000438913100016,29720383,,,,

Similar to individual immune defenses, social immunity, that is antiparasite defenses mounted for the benefit of individuals other than the actor, is predicted to be altered in social groups. The eusocial honey bee (Apis mellifera) secretes glucose oxidase (GOX), an antiseptic enzyme, throughout its colony, thereby providing immune protection to other individuals in the hive. We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the effects of group density on social immunity, specifically GOX activity, body mass and feeding behavior in caged honey bees. Individual honeybees caged in a low group density displayed increased GOX activity relative to those kept at a high group density. In addition, we provided evidence for a trade-off between GOX activity and body mass: Individuals caged in the low group density had a lower body mass, despite consuming more food overall. Our results provide the first experimental evidence that group density affects a social immune response in a eusocial insect. Moreover, we showed that the previously reported trade-off between immunity and body mass extends to social immunity. GOX production appears to be costly for individuals, and potentially the colony, given that low body mass is correlated with small foraging ranges in bees. At high group densities, individuals can invest less in social immunity than at low densities, while presumably gaining shared protection from infection. Thus, there is evidence that trade-offs at the individual level (GOX vs. body mass) can affect colony-level fitness.",,,,"Arnold, Kathryn E/F-8683-2016","Arnold, Kathryn E/0000-0002-6485-6065",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,MAY,2018,8,10,,,,,4852,4859,,10.1002/ece3.4011,,,,,,,WOS:000434093100011,29876063,,,,

Several parasite species are known to infect bumblebees, an important group of pollinators. Task allocation within bumblebee colonies can also cause differences in behaviour. Thus, task allocation may lead to context-dependent impacts of parasites on host behaviour. This study uses Bombus terrestris and its gut trypanosome Crithidia bombi, to investigate the effects of parasitism, task allocation (foraging or nest-work) and their interactions, on olfactory learning. Prior to undergoing the olfactory learning task, bees were orally infected with a field-realistic dose of C. bombi, and observed to determine task allocation. Parasitism did not significantly affect olfactory learning, but task allocation did, with foragers being significantly more likely to learn than nest bees. There was no significant interaction between parasitism and task. These results suggest that C. bombi is unlikely to affect pollination services via changes in olfactory learning of its host if bees are under no environmental or nutritional stress. However, wild and commercial colonies are likely to face such stressors.

Interestingly, no scientific data are available, neither about the past nor the present status of naturally nesting honeybee colonies. We expected near-natural beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests to provide enough suitable nest sites to be a home for feral honey bee colonies in Europe. Here, we made a first assessment of their occurrence and density in two German woodland areas based on two methods, the tracing of nest sites based on forager flight routes (beelining technique), and the direct inspection of potential cavity trees. Further, we established experimental swarms at forest edges and decoded dances for nest sites performed by scout bees in order to study how far swarms from beekeeper-managed hives would potentially move into a forest. We found that feral honey bee colonies regularly inhabit tree cavities in near-natural beech forests at densities of at least 0.11-0.14 colonies/km(2). Colonies were not confined to the forest edges; they were also living deep inside the forests. We estimated a median distance of 2,600 m from the bee trees to the next apiaries, while scout bees in experimental swarms communicated nest sites in close distances (median: 470 m). We extrapolate that there are several thousand feral honey bee colonies in German woodlands. These have to be taken in account when assessing the role of forest areas in providing pollination services to the surrounding land, and their occurrence has implications for the species' perception among researchers, beekeepers and conservationists.

Although many plant species have inducible defences to save metabolic costs of defence in the absence of herbivores, plant responses induced by herbivore attack can have ecological costs. For example, herbivore-induced responses can affect flower traits and alter interactions with flower visitors. Such plant-mediated interactions between herbivores and flower visitors can affect plant reproductive output. Current knowledge on the generality and specificity of plant-mediated herbivore-flower-visitor interactions and its consequences for plant fitness is limited. In this study, we investigated whether a broad range of herbivores feeding on the annual plant Brassica nigra affect interactions with flower visitors, whether the direction of interactions is predicted by the feeding modes (chewing and sap-feeding) and sites (above- and belowground) of the herbivores, and whether it results in fitness consequences for the plant. Our results show that attack of B. nigra by a range of different herbivores influenced plant interactions with mutualist pollinators and an antagonist florivore, the pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus. Pollinator community composition was affected by herbivory, whereas overall pollinator attraction was maintained. Pollinator community composition of uninfested plants differed from that of chewing and root herbivore-infested plants. Main responders in the pollinator communities to changes induced by herbivory were syrphid flies, bumblebees, and solitary bees. Although the preference of pollen beetle adults was not affected by herbivory, beetle larvae performed best on plants infested with the nematode Heterodera schachtii. The changes in pollinator community composition and syrphid fly visitation can explain the observed increase in seed set of root herbivore-infested plants. Interactions of flowering B. nigra plants with mutualist and antagonist insects are well integrated and conflicting interactions do not reduce reproductive output. Our results suggest some degree of specificity in herbivore-flower-visitor interactions with consequences for plant fitness. Specificity of plant responses were determined at the species level as well as the herbivore functional group level, and differed depending on the flower visitor. Because plant reproduction was affected by indirect plant-mediated interactions, these can potentially result in selection on plant strategies to optimize growth, defence and reproduction.",,,,"Lucas-Barbosa, Dani/AAD-8133-2020","Poelman, Erik/0000-0003-3285-613X; Rusman, Quint/0000-0003-0285-7967",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,APR,2018,32,4,,,,,1022,1035,,10.1111/1365-2435.13035,,,,,,,WOS:000429323400017,,,,,

However, the biology of tropical species is still little known. We present data on biology of Megachile brasiliensis Data Torre, Megachile sejuncta Cockerell and Megachile stilbonotaspis Moure found in two remnants of eastern Amazonian forest in northeastern Brazil. The study was conducted using the trap-nest methodology in two different areas during four periods. We collected a total of 24 nests of M. brasiliensis, 26 of M. sejuncta and 28 of M. stilbonotaspis. The differential abundance of collected nests may reflect the population size in each sampled place. The nesting activity was concentrated mainly between July and January and species presented a multivoltine pattern, except for M. sejuncta, which was partly univoltine. Assessed pollen use showed a predominant use of Attalea sp. (Arecaceae) and, for M. stilbonotaspis, Tylesia sp. and Lepidaploa sp. (Asteraceae). Babassu is a very common palm in the studied areas and the studied species seem to have a strong link with it. We also reported change of pollen use by M. sejuncta, probably due to competition with M. brasiliensis, which may have influenced the biased sex ratio observed in M. sejuncta toward males. Parasites reported here were also recorded for other Megachile species, such as Coelioxys, Brachymeria, Meloidae and Pyralidae species. Mites were observed in association with M. stilbonotaspis. The data presented here set up a background that encourages new studies on the ecology of these three Amazonian species, providing tools for proper biodiversity management and conservation.

Almond orchards are often treated with pesticides to control a variety of pests and pathogens, particularly during bloom. While the effects to honey bee health of some insecticides, particularly neonicotinoids, have received attention recently, the impact of other types of insecticides on honey bee health is less clear. In this study, we examined the effects to honey bee forager survival of three non-neonicotinoid pesticides widely used during the 2014 California almond bloom. We collected foragers from a local apiary and exposed them to three pesticides at the label dose, or at doses ranging from 0.5 to 3 times the label dose rate. The selected pesticides included the insect growth regulators methoxyfenozide and pyriproxyfen, and the acaricide bifenazate. We simulated field exposure of honey bees to these pesticides during aerial application in almond orchards by using a wind tunnel and atomizer set up with a wind speed of 2.9 m/s. Experimental groups consisting of 30-40 foragers each were exposed to either untreated controls or pesticide-laden treatments and were monitored every 24 hr over a 10-d period.

In forest landscapes, silvicultural conifer plantations often have reduced and fragmented natural broadleaf forests, which seem to provide more floral resources for bees than do the plantations. 2. This study evaluated the effects of forest characteristics (i.e. elevation, area, edge length, and tree size of natural forests) on pollen diets (plant taxa assemblages of pollen grains in provisions) and total provision mass in oviposited chambers in nests made by a standardised number of Osmia cornifrons bees at 14 sites in a forestry area in central Japan. 3. From April to May, the numbers of nests and chambers per nest increased, and the provision mass per chamber decreased. Main pollen sources were Prunus at higher elevations in April and Wisteria at lower elevations in May, foraging on which increased the numbers of nests and chambers per nest. The provision mass per chamber was smaller at higher elevations in more fragmented natural forests. Decreases in the area of natural forests within the foraging range (400-m radii) of O. cornifrons increased the utilisation of Rubus pollen and decreased the total provision mass. 4.

Although much attention has been devoted to long-range navigation and homing in birds, until recently, very little was known about how birds control flight in a moment-to-moment fashion. A bird that flies rapidly through dense foliage to land on a branch-as birds often do-engages in a veritable three-dimensional slalom, in which it has to continually dodge branches and leaves, and find, and possibly even plan a collision-free path to the goal in real time.

We measured uptake and dissipation of soil-applied imidacloprid and dinotefuran in nectar and leaves of 2 woody plant species, a broadleaf evergreen tree (Ilexxattenuata) and a deciduous shrub (Clethra alnifolia), to assess concentrations to which pollinators and pests might be exposed in landscape settings. Three application timings, autumn (postbloom), spring (prebloom), and summer (early postbloom), were evaluated to see if taking advantage of differences in the neonicotinoids' systemic mobility and persistence might enable pest control while minimizing transference into nectar. Nectar and tissue samples were collected from in-ground plants and analyzed for residues by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) in 2 successive years. Concentrations found in nectar following autumn or spring applications ranged from 166 to 515ng/g for imidacloprid and from 70 to 1235ng/gg for dinotefuran, depending on plant and timing.

Explanations for Mendacibombus distributions can be identified that require only short-distance dispersal along mountain corridors, commensurate with the limited dispersal ability observed for bumblebees. These explanations depend on the timing of uplift of mountain ranges, regional climate change, and climate-niche evolution. The uplift of the QTP may have contributed to the initial Oligocene divergence of the common ancestor of Mendacibombus from other bumblebees, but for the first two thirds of the history of Mendacibombus, only a single lineage has present-day descendants. Divergence of multiple extant Mendacibombus lineages coincided with the Late Miocene-Pliocene uplift of externally connecting mountains, combined with regional climate cooling. These changes provided greater connectivity of suitable habitat, allowing these bumblebees to disperse out of the western QTP via new high bridges, escaping along the mountain corridors of the Tian Shan and Hindu Kush ranges, reaching eventually far to the west (Iberian Peninsula) and to the north-east (Kamchatka).",,,,"Meseguer, Andrea/H-8593-2019","Meseguer, Andrea/0000-0003-0743-404X",,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,MAR,2018,41,3,,,,,461,477,,10.1111/ecog.03074,,,,,,,WOS:000426725400004,,,,,

The present article reports the results of laboratory studies (10-d adult and 22-d larval toxicity studies assessing the chronic toxicity of thiamethoxam to adult honey bees and larvae, respectively) and a colony feeding study, with 6 wk of exposure in an area with limited alternative forage, to provide a prewintering colony-level endpoint. The endpoints following exposure of individuals in the laboratory (10-d adult chronic no-observed-effect concentration [NOEC] for mortality 117g thiamethoxam/kg sucrose solution, 141g thiamethoxam/L sucrose solution; 22-d larval chronic NOEC 102g thiamethoxam/kg diet) are compared with those generated at the colony level, which incorporates sublethal effects (no-observed-adverse-effect concentration [NOAEC] 50g thiamethoxam/L sucrose solution, 43g thiamethoxam/kg sucrose solution). The data for sucrose-fed honey bee colonies support the lack of effects identified in previous colony-level field studies with thiamethoxam. However, unlike these field studies demonstrating no effects, colony feeding study data also provide a threshold level of exposure likely to result in adverse effects on the colony in the absence of alternative forage, and a basis by which to evaluate the potential risk of thiamethoxam residues detected in pollen, nectar, or water following treatment of bee-attractive crops.

High configurational landscape heterogeneity due to small fields and a high amount of field boundaries is hypothesized to enhance farmland biodiversity. Here, we investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming in large- vs. small-scale agricultural landscapes on wild bee communities and their floral resources to improve conservation schemes for pollinators. We sampled bees in Central Germany at the field boundaries of 18 pairs of conventionally and organically managed winter wheat fields along the former iron curtain using pan traps and trap nests. Around traps, we surveyed species richness and flower cover of insect-pollinated forbs. Compared to conventional farming, organic farming was related to higher insect-pollinated forb species richness and flower cover in the field boundaries, presumably due to the lack of herbicide use. Interestingly, small-scale agriculture did not counteract the loss of floral resources under conventional management, as the difference to organic management was even larger in Western small-scale agriculture. Organic farming, but not small-scale agriculture, enhanced species richness of solitary bees, which is in line with their small home ranges. In contrast, bumblebees benefitted only from small-scale agriculture, which matches with their high dispersal ability. Despite similar levels of abundance and diversity of trap-nesting bees in the two landscape types, brood cell parasitism was also higher in small-scale agriculture. Both organic farming and small-scale agriculture directly and indirectly supported different groups of wild bees, suggesting long-term benefits for conservation.

During daily foraging in agricultural landscapes, they encounter a mosaic of patches with nest and foraging habitat and unsuitable matrix. It is insufficiently clear how spatial allocation of nesting and foraging resources and foraging traits of bees affect their daily foraging performance. We investigated potential brood cell construction (as proxy of fitness), number of visited flowers, foraging habitat visitation and foraging distance (pollination proxies) with the model SOLBEE (simulating pollen transport by solitary bees, tested and validated in an earlier study), for landscapes varying in landscape fragmentation and spatial allocation of nesting and foraging resources. Simulated bees varied in body size and nesting preference. We aimed to understand effects of landscape fragmentation and bee traits on bee fitness and the pollination services bees provide, as well as interactions between them, and the general consequences it has to our understanding of the system. This broad scope gives multiple key results. 1) Body size determines fitness more than landscape fragmentation, with large bees building fewer brood cells. High pollen requirements for large bees and the related high time budgets for visiting many flowers may not compensate for faster flight speeds and short handling times on flowers, giving them overall a disadvantage compared to small bees. 2) Nest preference does affect distribution of bees over the landscape, with cavity-nesting bees being restricted to nesting along field edges, which inevitably leads to performance reductions. Fragmentation mitigates this for cavity-nesting bees through increased edge habitat. 3) Landscape fragmentation alone had a relatively small effect on all responses. Instead, the local ratio of nest to foraging habitat affected bee fitness positively through reduced local competition. The spatial coverage of pollination increases steeply in response to this ratio for all bee sizes. The nest to foraging habitat ratio, a strong habitat proxy incorporating fragmentation could be a promising and practical measure for comparing landscape suitability for pollinators. 4) The number of flower visits was hardly affected by resource allocation, but predominantly by bee size. 5) In landscapes with the highest visitation coverage, bees flew least far, suggesting that these pollination proxies are subject to a trade-off between either longer pollen transport distances or a better pollination coverage, linked to how nests are distributed over the landscape rather than being affected by bee size.",,,,"Settele, Josef/A-6371-2009","Settele, Josef/0000-0002-8624-4983",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Feb-14,2018,13,2,,,,,,,e0188269,10.1371/journal.pone.0188269,,,,,,,WOS:000425183500003,29444076,,,,

In addition, research so far has focused on the landscape impacts on bees sampled in cropped fields while the landscape effects on bees inhabiting seminatural habitats are understudied. Here, we investigate the impact of the landscape on wild bee assemblages in 66 phryganic (low scrubland) communities on 8 Aegean islands. We computed landscape metrics (total area and total perimeter-area ratio) in 4 concentric circles (250, 500, 750, and 1000 m) around the center of each bee sampling site including 3 habitat groups (namely phrygana, cultivated land, and natural forests). We further measured the local flower cover in 25 quadrats distributed randomly at the center of each sampling site. We found that the landscape scale is more important than the local scale in shaping abundance and species richness of bees. Furthermore, habitat configuration was more important than the total area of habitats, probably because it affects bees' movement across the landscape. Phrygana and natural forests had a positive effect on bee demographics, while cultivated land had a negative effect. This demonstrates that phryganic specialists drive bee assemblages in these seminatural landscapes. This finding, together with the shown importance of landscape scale, should be considered for the management of wild bees with special emphasis placed on the spatial configuration of seminatural habitats.",,,,"Tscheulin, T./B-9722-2011; Petanidou, Theodora/C-9399-2011","Tscheulin, T./0000-0002-9901-1521; Petanidou, Theodora/0000-0003-1883-0945",,,,,,,,,,,,1672-9609,1744-7917,,,,FEB,2018,25,1,,,,,172,182,,10.1111/1744-7917.12383,,,,,,,WOS:000423106500016,27512960,,,,

We conducted a cost-benefit analysis to assess how managing blue orchard bees (Osmia lignaria Say [Hymenoptera: Megachildae]) alongside honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus [Hymenoptera: Apidae]) can affect profits for almond growers in California. Specifically, we studied how adjusting three strategies can influence profits: (1) number of released O. lignaria bees, (2) density of artificial nest boxes, and (3) number of nest cavities (tubes) per box. We developed an ecological model for the effects of pollinator activity on almond yields, validated the model with published data, and then estimated changes in profits for different management strategies. Our model shows that almond yields increase with O. lignaria foraging density, even where honey bees are already in use. Our cost-benefit analysis shows that profit ranged from -US$1,800 to US$2,800/acre given different combinations of the three strategies. Adding nest boxes had the greatest effect; we predict an increase in profit between low and high nest box density strategies (2.5 and 10 boxes/acre). In fact, the number of released bees and the availability of nest tubes had relatively small effects in the high nest box density strategies. This suggests that growers could improve profits by simply adding more nest boxes with moderate number of tubes in each. Our approach can support grower decisions regarding integrated crop pollination and highlight the importance of a comprehensive ecological economic framework for assessing these decisions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0493,1938-291X,,,,FEB,2018,111,1,,,,,16,25,,10.1093/jee/tox318,,,,,,,WOS:000424973300003,29272519,,,,

More specifically, each bee is set to move according to individual strategies and social interactions, the former involving the desire to reach a target destination, the latter accounting for repulsive/attractive stimuli and for alignment processes. The insects tend in fact to remain sufficiently close to the rest of the population, while avoiding collisions, and they are able to track and synchronize their movement to the flight of a given set of neighbors within their visual field. The resulting collective behavior of the bee cloud therefore emerges from non-local short/long-range interactions. Differently from similar approaches present in the literature, we here test different alignment mechanisms (i.e., based either on an Euclidean or on a topological neighborhood metric), which have an impact also on the other social components characterizing insect behavior. A series of numerical realizations then shows the phenomenology of the swarm (in terms of pattern configuration, collective productive movement, and flight synchronization) in different regions of the space of free model parameters (i.e., strength of attractive/repulsive forces, extension of the interaction regions). In this respect, constraints in the possible variations of such coefficients are here given both by reasonable empirical observations and by analytical results on some stability characteristics of the defined pairwise interaction kernels, which have to assure a realistic crystalline configuration of the swarm.

Its colony is mainly coordinated by the chemical signals such as pheromones produced by queen or brood. Correspondingly, the worker bee developed numerous complicated olfactory sensilla in antennae for detection of these colony chemical signals and nectar/pollen signals in foraging. With the normal development of new emerged workers, young adults (nurse bee) worked in colony at the first 2-3 weeks and then followed by the foraging activity outside of the hive, which give rise to great change of the surrounding chemical signals. However, the olfactory adaption mechanism of worker bee in these processes of behavioral development is still unclear. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of gene expression in Apis mellifera antenna of newly emerged workers, nurses and foragers using transcriptome analysis. Meanwhile, we constructed experimental colonies to collect age-matched samples, which were used to determine whether task is the principal determinant of differential expression. RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that 6 and 14 genes were closely associated with nurse and forager behaviors, respectively.

We firstly reported genes associated with nursing/foraging behavior from antennae and the variations of expression of genes belonging to various olfactory gene families at different development stages.

Physical communication in ants has been demonstrated to play a role as a modulator of behaviours such as alarm and recruitment. Honeybees can communicate the location of a resource using an advanced motor display-the waggle dance. However, no equivalent of the waggle dance has been described for any ant species, and it is widely believed that ants cannot communicate the location of resources using motor displays. One group of researchers report several demonstrations of such communication in Formica ants; however, these results have been largely ignored. More recently some evidence arose that Lasius niger foragers returning from a food source can communicate to outgoing foragers the direction that should be taken at the next bifurcation by means of physical contact on the trail. Here, we make a concerted effort to replicate these results. Although initial results seemed to indicate physical communication, once stringent controls to eliminate pheromone cues were put in place, no evidence for physical communication of food location could be found. This null result was replicated independently by a different research group on a closely related species, L. neglectus. We conclude that neither L. niger nor L. neglectus foragers communicate resource location using physical contact.

About half of the species in the tribe are currently assigned to the genus Eucera and to a few other related genera. In this large genus complex, comprising ca. 390 species, the boundaries between genera remain ambiguous due to morphological intergradation among taxa. Using ca. 6700 aligned nucleotide sites from six gene fragments, 120 morphological characters, and more than 100 taxa, we present the first comprehensive molecular, morphological, and combined phylogenetic analyses of the 'Eucera complex'. The revised generic classification that we propose is congruent with our phylogeny and maximizes both generic stability and ease of identification. Under this new classification most generic names are synonymized under an expanded genus Eucera. Thus, Tetralonia, Peponapis, Xenoglossa, Cemolobus, and Syntrichalonia are reduced to subgeneric rank within Eucera, and Synhalonia is retained as a subgenus of Eucera. Xenoglossodes is reestablished as a valid subgenus of Eucera while Tetraloniella is synonymized with Tetralonia and Cubitalia with Eucera. In contrast, we suggest that the venusta-group of species, currently placed in the subgenus Synhalonia, should be recognized as a new genus. Our results demonstrate the need to evaluate convergent loss or gain of important diagnostic traits to minimize the use of potentially homoplasious characters when establishing classifications. Lastly, we show that the Eucera complex originated in the Nearctic region in the late Oligocene, and dispersed twice into the Old World. The first dispersal event likely occurred 24.2-16.6 mya at a base of a clade of summer-active bees restricted to warm region of the Old World, and the second 13.9-12.3 mya at the base of a clade of spring-active bees found in cooler regions of the Holarctic.

Therefore, the objective of the study was to develop species-specific allometric equations for O. europaea L. subsp. cuspidata using semi-destructive method and evaluate allometric models for estimating the aboveground biomass (AGB). Results and Discussions: After all the necessary biomass calculations were done, seven AGB equations were developed. These regression equations relate AGB with diameter at breast height (DBH), height (H), and density (rho) individually and in combination. Out of seven, four allometric equations were chosen based on goodness-of-fit statistics and three were rejected. The selected models were tested for accuracy based on observed data. The best models selected have higher R-2-adj and lower residual standard error and Akaike information criterion than rejected equations. The relations for all selected models are significant (p < 0.000), which showed strong correlation of AGB with selected dendrometric variables. Accordingly, the AGB was strongly correlated with DBH and was not significantly correlated with wood density and height individually in O. europaea L. subsp. cuspidata allometric equation development.

In the present study, we gathered all scientific data related to the effects of insect-resistant GM crops (mostly corn and cotton, and also oilseed rape, rice, soybean, and wheat) on honey bees. Assessments included feeding honey bees with purified insecticidal toxins or transgenic pollen collected from GM crops producing such toxins, namely protease inhibitors (PIs), Cry or VIP toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis.

Morphological convergences of flower traits have allowed flowers to maximize their attraction to pollinator agents leading to the concept of pollination syndromes. Due to habitat heterogeneity, low water retention and resource availability in the soil, as well as broad altitudinal range of the system, plants often show restricted distributions in rupestrian grasslands. The present study aimed to describe the floral biology and reproductive aspects of Collaea cipoensis, a shrub restricted to small patches alongside watercourses in rupestrian grasslands of Serra do Cipo, Brazil. Specifically, weexamined the dependence on pollinators to set fruits and the functional role of floral visitors (i.e. pollinators, nectar-robbers, nectar-thieves, and florivores). Collaea cipoensis is a strictly xenogamous species and two hummingbirds (Colibri serrirostris and Eupetomena macroura) are its potential pollinators. Although C. serrirostris also behaves as illegitimate visitor, it represents 90% of legitimate visits, thus being the most important pollinator. However, the most common flower visitors are two important nectar-robbers, the bee Trigona spinipes and the syrphid Toxomerus musicus. The species is self-incompatible and pollen-limited, as hand-pollination increased fruit production more than 50%. Still, hand-pollination set only 20% of fruits and 48% of seeds. Overall, the dependence on cross-pollination, the stressful environmental conditions and the high floral visitation rates by illegitimate visitors may limit reproduction of this species, leading to a fitness reduction.

Field studies are needed to determine whether these effects also occur when bees forage on flowering crops grown from neonicotinoid-treated seeds. However, for many reasons the results of field experiments may be inconsistent. For example, neonicotinoid residues in crop nectar and pollen and the availability of alternative nectar and pollen sources vary. In addition to these practical difficulties, different field experiment designs, especially different controls, address different questions. Most field studies on neonicotinoids have compared the performance of colonies adjacent to a bee-attractive crop grown from treated seeds with control colonies adjacent to the same crop grown from untreated seeds. This makes it possible to determine the cost, C, of any insecticide residues but not the overall effect of the crop, B - C, which includes any benefits, B, of the additional pollen and nectar. An alternative and rarely used design, only 1 of the 12 field studies reviewed, determines the overall effect of the crop by siting control colonies out of foraging range of the crop but in the same landscape. This design may be more relevant because bee-attractive crops, such as oilseed rape, are normally grown as alternatives to arable crops that do not provide bee forage, such as wheat and barley. As a result, it is possible that B - C>0 ( or B - C - 0) even if C>0.

The yellow spots were procured from the surface of a number of leaves and other objects from three different localities of Lucknow District of Uttar Pradesh. The size and shapes of these spots vary, ranging from linear to circular. Pollen grains recovered in good frequencies chiefly belong to angiosperms, whereas some gymnosperm pollen was also observed in trace frequencies. Other microbiota include fern spores, fungal remains and insect body parts in lower values. The study broadly suggests that palynomorphs recovered from yellow droppings are not fully airborne; rather, they are the types that honey bees gather from crop fields to feed their young. Brassica campestris and Asteroideae are the dominant plant taxa recorded in yellow rain samples. On investigation, it was noticed that yellow drop falling occurred for a few minutes on limited days during the summer of 2014, when the atmosphere experienced optimal temperature conditions with relatively humid environs. The observation also confirms that the yellow spots are nothing but faecal droppings, as suggested by the bee faeces theory which proposed that the origin of yellow rain is a phenomenon of nature. The study, in addition to aiding in understanding yellow rain occurrence, could also be helpful in aerobiological research, especially in examining the allergenicity of various pollen grains/spores in the area of investigation, causing bronchial asthma, hay fever (allergic rhinitis/pollinosis), nasobronchial allergy and other respiratory disorders along with conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, food allergies and other health ailments.

Trembleya laniflora Cong. (Melastomataceae: Microlicieae) is an endemic species from campo rupestre tropical grassland, with large and white pollen flowers differing from the common purple-colored flowers of the Tribe. We examine the relationship between the distinct floral characteristics of T. laniflora and its pollination syndrome and reproduction ecology. We observed different individuals of T. laniflora randomly sampled in Serra do Cipo, Espinhaco Range, Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. We carried out observations on their reproductive phenology (31 individuals), flower biology (3), pollination (23), and tested the reproductive system (29). Trembleya laniflora presented a seasonal flowering pattern in the dry and post-dry seasons (MayOctober) and set fruits during the dry, post-dry and rainy seasons (June-December). Floral aperture occurred mainly during the night and the first hours of the morning, the period with the greatest availability of fresh flowers and with the highest visitation by Xylocopa bimaculata. Tests identified the species as non-apomictic, self-incompatible and dependent on large bees such as Xylocopa, Bombus, Centris and Ptiloglossa for pollination. Trembleya laniflora showed a specialized pollination system mediated by a restricted group of bees that perform crepuscular buzz pollination. Floral characteristics and reproductive biology of T. laniflora are likely adaptive responses to pollination by large bees foraging during the crepuscular hours. Our results support the pollination syndrome hypothesis, demonstrating a direct relationship between a set of floral characters and the principal pollinators of the species.

The bottom-up modeling paradigm provides an ideal approach to bridging the gap between known mechanisms of individual organisms and unknown spatial temporal dynamics of pollination at the field scale. By linking empirical data to stochastically-based ecological process modeling, we present a spatially-explicit agent-based simulation model that enables exploration of how various factors, including plant spatial arrangements, outcrossing and self-pollination, bee species compositions and weather conditions, in isolation and combination, affect pollination efficiency throughout a blueberry bloom season. The firmly validated open-source model is a useful tool for hypothesis testing and theory development for wild blueberry pollination researches. Sensitivity analysis suggested that fruit set and resulting measures of productivity such as fruit mass and viable seeds per fruit were sensitive to parameterization of blueberry genotype or clone size and the amount of blueberry plant cover in a field. Fruit set due to pollen compatibility was sensitive to ovule number per flower and foraging bee density. Simulation experiments allowed us to compare bee pollination efficiencies at the bee taxon population level (honey bees, bumble bees, and native solitary bees), the effect of foraging distance from bee nest or colony site on fruit set, and test whether the mechanism of gametophytic self-incompatibility (pre- vs. post-zygotic decision making by the plant) in wild blueberry pollination at the field level matters in estimating yield.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-1699,1872-7107,,,,JAN,2018,144,,,,,,94,101,,10.1016/j.compag.2017.11.003,,,,,,,WOS:000425072400011,,,,,

We employ a unique integration of population genetic tools and spatially explicit foraging models to estimate foraging distances and rates of patch visitation for wild bumblebee colonies across three study regions and two seasons. By mapping the locations of 669 wild-caught individual foragers, we find substantial variation in colony-level foraging distances, often exhibiting a 60-fold difference within a study region. Our analysis of visitation rates indicates that foragers display a preference for destination patches with high floral cover and forage significantly farther for these patches, but only in the summer, when landscape-level resources are low. Overall, these results indicate that an increasing proportion of long-distance foraging bouts take place in the summer. Because wild bees are pollinators, their foraging dynamics are of urgent concern, given the potential impacts of global change on their movement and services.

The treated bees with 1 ng clothianidin show a significant increase in total distance moved over the experimental period.

Forager bees direct their nestmates to profitable resources via a complex motor display. Essentially, the dance encodes the polar coordinates to the resource in the field. Unemployed foragers follow the dancer's movements and then search for the advertised spots in the field. Throughout the last decades, biologists have employed different techniques to measure key characteristics of the waggle dance and decode the information it conveys. Early techniques involved the use of protractors and stopwatches to measure the dance orientation and duration directly from the observation hive. Recent approaches employ digital video recordings and manual measurements on screen. However, manual approaches are very time-consuming. Most studies, therefore, regard only small numbers of animals in short periods of time. We have developed a system capable of automatically detecting, decoding and mapping communication dances in real-time. In this paper, we describe our recording setup, the image processing steps performed for dance detection and decoding and an algorithm to map dances to the field. The proposed system performs with a detection accuracy of 90.07%. The decoded waggle orientation has an average error of -2.92 degrees (+/- 7.37 degrees), well within the range of human error.

We explored bumblebees' route development on an array of five artificial flowers in which minimising travel distances between individual feeders conflicted with minimising overall distance. No previous study of bee spatial navigation has been able to follow animals' movement during learning; we tracked bumblebee foragers continuously, using harmonic radar, and examined the process of route formation in detail for a small number of selected individuals. On our array, bees did not settle on visit sequences that gave the shortest overall path, but prioritised movements to nearby feeders. Nonetheless, flight distance and duration reduced with experience. This increased efficiency was attributable mainly to experienced bees reducing exploration beyond the feeder array and flights becoming straighter with experience, rather than improvements in the sequence of feeder visits. Flight paths of all legs of a flight stabilised at similar rates, whereas the first few feeder visits became fixed early while bees continued to experiment with the order of later visits. Stabilising early sections of a route and prioritising travel between nearby destinations may reduce the search space, allowing rapid adoption of efficient routes.",,,,"Chittka, Lars/C-3110-2012; Lim, Ka Sing/B-4480-2012","Chittka, Lars/0000-0001-8153-1732; Lim, Ka Sing/0000-0002-9166-2928; Makinson, James/0000-0001-9772-0802",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,Dec-11,2017,7,,,,,,,,17323,10.1038/s41598-017-17553-1,,,,,,,WOS:000417570500042,29230062,,,,

Bats display remarkable navigation capabilities, ranging from nightly commutes of several kilometers and up to seasonal migrations over thousands of kilometers [5]. Many bats have been suggested to fly along fixed routes termed ""flyways,'' when flying from their roost to their foraging sites [6]. Flyways commonly stretch along linear landscape elements such as tree lines, hedges, or rivers [7]. When flying along a flyway, bats must estimate the distance they have traveled in order to determine when to turn. This can be especially challenging when moving along a repetitive landscape. Some bats, like Kuhl's pipistrelles, which we studied here, have limited vision [8] and were suggested to rely on bio-sonar for navigation. These bats could therefore estimate distance using three main sensory-navigation strategies, all of which we have examined: acoustic flow, acoustic landmarks, or path integration. We trained bats to fly along a linear flyway and land on a platform. We then tested their behavior when the platform was removed under different manipulations, including changing the acoustic flow, moving the start point, and adding wind. We found that bats do not require acoustic flow, which was hypothesized to be important for their navigation [9-15], and that they can perform the task without landmarks. Our results suggest that Kuhl's pipistrelles use internal self-motion cues-also known as path integration-rather than external information to estimate flight distance for at least dozens of meters when navigating along linear flyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,1879-0445,,,,Dec-04,2017,27,23,,,,,3650,+,,10.1016/j.cub.2017.10.012,,,,,,,WOS:000417140100023,29153322,,,,

Populations of this species are highly threatened in large parts of its range due to overexploitation and environmental degradation. In the light of climatic changes, safeguarding the genetic diversity of the species is crucial to foster adaptation and to support its long-term survival. Genetic insight is also relevant to guide sustainable harvesting. This paper has the objective to review information on the species' geographic distribution, reproductive biology, genetic characteristics and existing conservation practices, and to identify knowledge gaps to orientate future conservation and research focus. The literature review revealed that the species is mainly outcrossed and is pollinated by a diversity of vectors, including bats that allow long-pollen dispersal. When bats are absent, pollination is mainly carried out by honey bees and stingless bees and in such case pollen-mediated gene flow is relatively restricted. Data of a large-scale genetic study based on allozyme markers showing a moderate genetic differentiation among populations were reanalyzed using an inverse distance weighted interpolation function. Three distinctive regions of diversity based on allelic richness and expected heterozygosity were identified.

Additionally, GM pollen grains were found in honey collected from honeybees foraging on both GM and non-GM oilseed rape cultivars.

However, the conditions promoting the existence of such systems are still an enigma. We suggest that by focusing on floral similarity between model and mimic, reward levels offered by models, and pollinators' ability to adjust foraging accordingly, the conditions can be better understood. Using spatially-explicit modelling, we examined trait combinations that lead to the survival of deceptive species under a large range of mimic strategies, from Batesian mimicry to general food deception. Unlike previous models studying such systems, we examined model-mimic interactions in the presence of a third, dissimilar species, thus generating a more realistic scenario where pollinators may avoid the model-mimic system altogether. Results showed that overall survival and abundance of species in food deceptive systems depend on the relative reward provided by the participating species and the potential alternatives available. Specifically, the success of a mimic in a Batesian mimicry system depends on high levels of reward provided by its model species relative to potential alternatives in the flower community. On the other hand, the success of a mimic in a general food deception system was higher when the reward offered was lower. Our study suggests that the ability of pollinators to utilize their experience as part of decision-making is highly relevant in promoting mimic survival, thus shedding light on the conditions under which food deception is expected.",,,,"Seifan, Merav/Q-1654-2015","Seifan, Merav/0000-0002-2830-5450",,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,DEC,2017,126,12,,,,,1815,1826,,10.1111/oik.04268,,,,,,,WOS:000416939400015,,,,,

Given the clinical relevance of such injuries, especially in military settings, it is paramount to develop more accurate and reliable on-field evaluation tools. This work presents the design and implementation of the automated assessment of postural stability (AAPS) system, for on-field evaluations following concussion. The AAPS is a computer system, based on inexpensive off-the-shelf components and custom software, that aims to automatically and reliably evaluate balance deficits, by replicating a known on-field clinical test, namely, the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS). The AAPS main innovation is its balance error detection algorithm that has been designed to acquire data from a Microsoft Kinect(A (R)) sensor and convert them into clinically-relevant BESS scores, using the same detection criteria defined by the original BESS test. In order to assess the AAPS balance evaluation capability, a total of 15 healthy subjects (7 male, 8 female) were required to perform the BESS test, while simultaneously being tracked by a Kinect 2.0 sensor and a professional-grade motion capture system (Qualisys AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). High definition videos with BESS trials were scored off-line by three experienced observers for reference scores. AAPS performance was assessed by comparing the AAPS automated scores to those derived by three experienced observers. Our results show that the AAPS error detection algorithm presented here can accurately and precisely detect balance deficits with performance levels that are comparable to those of experienced medical personnel. Specifically, agreement levels between the AAPS algorithm and the human average BESS scores ranging between 87.9% (single-leg on foam) and 99.8% (double-leg on firm ground) were detected. Moreover, statistically significant differences in balance scores were not detected by an ANOVA test with alpha equal to 0.05. Despite some level of disagreement between human and AAPS-generated scores, the use of an automated system yields important advantages over currently available human-based alternatives. These results underscore the value of using the AAPS, that can be quickly deployed in the field and/or in outdoor settings with minimal set-up time. Finally, the AAPS can record multiple error types and their time course with extremely high temporal resolution. These features are not achievable by humans, who cannot keep track of multiple balance errors with such a high resolution. Together, these results suggest that computerized BESS calculation may provide more accurate and consistent measures of balance than those derived from human experts.",,,,,"Napoli, Alessandro/0000-0002-4061-3747; Obeid, Iyad/0000-0002-5796-843X",,,,,,,,,,,,0090-6964,1573-9686,,,,DEC,2017,45,12,,,,,2784,2793,,10.1007/s10439-017-1911-8,,,,,,,WOS:000415726200007,28856486,,,,

Traditional tropical agriculture often entails a form of slash-and-burn land management that may adversely affect ecosystem services such as pollination, which are required for successful crop yields. The Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico has a >4000year history of traditional slash-and-burn agriculture, termed milpa'. Hot Habanero' chilli is a major pollinator-dependent crop that nowadays is often grown in monoculture within the milpa system. 2. We studied 37 local farmers' chilli fields (sites) to evaluate the effects of landscape composition on bee communities. At 11 of these sites, we undertook experimental pollination treatments to quantify the pollination of chilli. We further explored the relationships between landscape composition, bee communities and pollination service provision to chilli. 3. Bee species richness, particularly species of the family Apidae, was positively related to the amount of forest cover. Species diversity decreased with increasing proportion of crop land surrounding each sampling site. Sweat bees of the genus Lasioglossum were the most abundant bee taxon in chilli fields and, in contrast to other bee species, increased in abundance with the proportion of fallow land, gardens and pastures which are an integral part of the milpa system. 4. There was an average pollination shortfall of 21% for chilli across all sites; yet the shortfall was unrelated to the proportion of land covered by crops. Rather, chilli pollination was positively related to the abundance of Lasioglossum bees, probably an important pollinator of chilli, as well indirectly to the proportion of fallow land, gardens and pastures that promote Lasioglossum abundance. 5. Synthesis and applications. Current, low-intensity traditional slash-and-burn (milpa) agriculture provides Lasioglossum spp. pollinators for successful chilli production; fallow land, gardens and pasture therefore need to be valued as important habitats for these and related ground-nesting bee species. However, the negative impact of agriculture on total bee species diversity highlights how agricultural intensification is likely to reduce pollination services to crops, including chilli. Indeed, natural forest cover is vital in tropical Yucatan to maintain a rich assemblage of bee species and the provision of pollination services for diverse crops and wild flowers.",,,,"Paxton, Robert/D-7082-2015; Murray, Tomas E/C-5540-2013; Theodorou, Panagiotis/D-4906-2015","Paxton, Robert/0000-0003-2517-1351; Theodorou, Panagiotis/0000-0002-4056-5300",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,DEC,2017,54,6,,,,,1814,1824,,10.1111/1365-2664.12860,,,,,,,WOS:000415194000022,29200497,,,,

Counts of nest-searching queens in spring and early summer have been used as an indication of preferred nesting habitat, but this relationship has not yet been validated; high densities of nest-searching queens may indicate habitat with few nesting opportunities (meaning that queens have to spend longer looking for them). 2. From mid April 2010, queen bumblebees were counted along 20 transects in grassland and woodland habitats in central Scotland, U.K. The number of inflorescences of suitable forage plants were also estimated at each transect visit.

Searches subsequently revealed 33 bumblebee nests. 4. The number of nest-searching queens on transects was significantly, positively related to the number of nests subsequently found. Estimated floral abundance along the transect did not correlate with numbers of nest-searching queens or with the number of nests found, suggesting that queens do not target their searching to areas that are locally high in spring forage. 5.

Dancing honeybees moved their wings for almost half (47%) of the duration of waggle phases. The number of wing-beating pulses and the combined duration of wing beating were strongly positively correlated with the duration of waggle phases (p<.0014), whereas the mean frequency of wing beats, the mean duration of wing-beating pulses and the mean number of wing beats in one wing-beating pulse were not correlated with the duration of waggle phases (p>.05).

In northern regions oilseed rape belongs to the main forage crops that is mostly cultivated by means of intensive agriculture, including several pesticide treatments. However, in addition to the focal forage crops, pesticides from non-forage crops can spread to wild flowers around fields, and thus the residues in honey would reflect the whole range of, pesticides used in the agricultural landscape. The aim of our study was to clarify which currently used pesticides are present in honey gathered from heterogeneous agricultural landscapes after the end of flowering of oilseed crops. Honey samples (N = 33) were collected from beehives of Estonia during 2013 and 2014, and analysed for residues of 47 currently used agricultural pesticides using the multiresidue method with HPLC-MS/ MS and GC-MS and a single residue method for glyphosate, aminopyralid and clopyralid. Residues of eight different active ingredients with representatives from all three basic pesticide classes were determined. Although no correlation was detected between the cumulative amount of pesticide residues and percent of oilseed crops in the foraging territory, most of the residues are those allowed for oilseed rape treatments. Among all pesticides, herbicide residues prevailed in 2013 but not in 2014. Despite the relatively small agricultural impact of Estonia, the detected levels of pesticide residues sometimes exceeded maximum residue level; however, these concentrations do not pose a health risk to consumers, also acute toxicity to honey bees would be very unlikely.

However, past functional studies have focused largely on seed production; although useful, this focus on seed set does not provide information regarding species-specific contributions to pollen-mediated gene flow. Here we quantify pollen dispersal for individual pollinator species across more than 690 ha of tropical forest. Specifically, we examine visitation, seed production, and pollen-dispersal ability for the entire pollinator community of a common tropical tree using a series of individual-based pollinator-exclusion experiments followed by molecular-based fractional paternity analyses. We investigate the effects of pollinator body size, plant size (as a proxy of floral display), local plant density, and local plant kinship on seed production and pollen-dispersal distance. Our results show that while large-bodied pollinators set more seeds per visit, small-bodied bees visited flowers more frequently and were responsible for more than 49% of all long-distance (beyond 1 km) pollen-dispersal events. Thus, despite their size, small-bodied bees play a critical role in facilitating long-distance pollen-mediated gene flow. We also found that both plant size and local plant kinship negatively impact pollen dispersal and seed production. By incorporating genetic and trait-based data into the quantification of pollination services, we highlight the diversity in ecological function mediated by pollinators, the influential role that plant and population attributes play in driving service provision, and the unexpected importance of small-bodied pollinators in the recruitment of plant genetic diversity.",,,,"Castilla, Antonio R./A-3877-2019","Castilla, Antonio R./0000-0002-4124-738X",,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,,,,,Nov-28,2017,114,48,,,,,12761,12766,,10.1073/pnas.1619271114,,,,,,,WOS:000416891600059,29127217,,,,

We examined the route-choice behavior of foraging honeybees when they encountered a barrier which could be traversed by flying through one of two apertures, positioned side by side. When the bees' choice behavior was averaged over the entire tested population, the two apertures were chosen with equal frequency when they were equally wide. When the apertures were of different width, the bees, on average, showed a preference for the wider aperture, which increased sharply with the difference between the aperture widths. Thus, bees are able to discriminate the widths of oncoming gaps and choose the passage which is presumably safer and quicker to transit. Examination of the behavior of individual bees revealed that, when the two apertures were equally wide, ca. 55% of the bees displayed no side bias in their choices. However, the remaining 45% showed varying degrees of bias, with one half of them preferring the left-hand aperture, and the other half the right-hand aperture. The existence of distinct individual biases was confirmed by measuring the times required by biased bees to transit various aperture configurations: The transit time was longer if a bee's intrinsic bias forced it to engage with the narrower aperture. Our results show that, at the population level, bees do not exhibit 'handedness' in choosing routes; however, individual bees display an idiosyncratic bias that can range from a strong left bias, through zero bias, to a strong right bias. In honeybees, previous studies of olfactory and visual learning have demonstrated clear biases at the population level. To our knowledge, our study is the first to uncover the existence of individually distinct biases in honeybees. We also show how a distribution of biases among individual honeybees can be advantageous in facilitating rapid transit of a group of bees through a cluttered environment, without any centralized decision-making or control.",,,,,"Muthukumarasamy, Srinivasan/0000-0002-2948-6206",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Nov-02,2017,12,11,,,,,,,e0184343,10.1371/journal.pone.0184343,,,,,,,WOS:000414340200001,29095830,,,,

Very few studies, however, have documented how genetic factors relate to behaviour at the colony level. Differences in expression of the foraging gene have been associated with differences in foraging and activity of a wide variety of organisms. We quantified expression of the red imported fire ant foraging gene (sifor) in workers from 21 colonies collected across the natural range of Texas fire ant populations, but maintained under standardized, environmentally controlled conditions. Colonies varied significantly in their behaviour. The most active colonies had up to 10 times more active foragers than the least active colony and more than 16 times as many workers outside the nest. Expression differences among colonies correlated with this colony-level behavioural variation. Colonies with higher sifor expression in foragers had, on average, significantly higher foraging activity, exploratory activity and recruitment to nectar than colonies with lower expression. Expression of sifor was also strongly correlated with worker task (foraging vs. working in the interior of the nest). These results provide insight into the genetic and physiological processes underlying collective differences in social behaviour. Quantifying variation in expression of the foraging gene may provide an important tool for understanding and predicting the ecological consequences of colony-level behavioural variation.",,,,"Bockoven, Alison/L-9807-2016","Bockoven, Alison/0000-0002-2117-1955",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,NOV,2017,26,21,,,,,5953,5960,,10.1111/mec.14347,,,,,,,WOS:000415362500007,28902438,,,,

However, there is often intensive use of systemic pesticides in crops, which can be carried to the colony by forage bees through the collection of contaminated pollen and nectar. Inside the colony, pollen loads are stored by bees that add honey and several enzymes to this pollen. Nevertheless, intra-colonial chronic exposure could induce sublethal effects in young bees exposed to a wide range of pesticides present in these pollen loads. This study was aimed to both determine the survival rate and evaluate the sublethal effects on the hepato-nephrocitic system in response to continuous oral exposure to lower concentrations of neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (TXT) and picoxystrobin fungicide (PXT). Exposure to a single chemical and co-exposure to both pesticides were performed in newly emerged honeybee workers. A significant decrease in the bee survival rates was observed following exposure to TXT (0.001 ng a.i./mu L) and PXT (0.018 ng a.i./mu L), as well as following co-exposure to TXT+PXT/2. After five days of continuous exposure, TXT induced sub-lethal effects in the organs involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, such as the fat body and pericardial cells, and it also induced a significant increase in the hemocyte number. Thus, the hepato-nephrocitic system (HNS) reached the greatest level of activity of pericardial cells as an attempt to eliminate this toxic compound from hemolymph. The HNS was activated at low levels by PXT without an increase in the hemocyte number; however, the mobilization of neutral glycoconjugates from the trophocytes of the fat body was prominent only in this group. TXT and PXT co-exposure induced intermediary morphological effects in trophocytes and pericardial cells, but oenocytes from the fat body presented with atypical cytoplasm granulation only in this group. These data showed that the realistic concentrations of these pesticides are harmful to newly emerged Africanized honeybees, indicating that intra-colonial chronic exposure drastically reduces the longevity of bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticide (TXT) and the fungicide strobilurin (PXT) as in single and co-exposure. Additionally, the sublethal effects observed in the organs constituting the HNS suggest that the activation of this system, even during exposure to low concentrations of theses pesticides, is an attempt to maintain homeostasis of the bees. These data together are alarming because these pesticides can affect the performance of the entire colony. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

African stingless bees have received much less attention by researchers. Our study aims to fill this gap and, therefore, focuses on the African stingless bee Plebeina hildebrandti. Food profitability appears to influence various aspects of the foraging process in stingless bees. To study the effect of food profitability on the foraging process, we trained foragers to artificial feeders containing different food qualities and studied the individual foraging process with respect to food uptake, foraging cycles, as well as food transfer to nestmates. Our results indicate that foragers of P. hildebrandti adjust foraging behaviors according to the food profitability in a way that may increase colony's efficiency. Furthermore, we studied the influence of different food qualities on the vibrational signals produced by foragers during food transfer. Signal duration, pulse duration, and duty cycle appear to be adjusted according to the food quality, i.e., profitability. We measured the duration potential recruits which have direct contact to the forager and asked whether this time is long enough to gain profitability information from the vibrational signals.

Wasps displaced within their probable foraging grounds returned to their nests on the day of release although they oriented randomly upon release; however, wasps fed before release returned sooner, displaying nest-ward orientation. When displaced to places far from their nests, thus expected to be unfamiliar, only a third returned on the day of release showing nest-ward orientation; others oriented randomly and either returned on subsequent days or never. When confined within mosquito-net tents since eclosion and later released to places close to their nests (but unfamiliar), even fed wasps oriented randomly, and only older wasps returned, taking longer time. Thus, contrary to insects inhabiting less-featured landscapes, R. marginata foragers appear to have thorough familiarity with their foraging grounds that enables them to orient and home efficiently after passive displacement. Their initial orientation is, however, determined by an interaction of the information acquired from surrounding landscape and their physiological motivation.

Shifts in insect pollinator phenology generally keep pace with advances in flowering, although there are exceptions.

Consequently, pollination experiments were conducted over 2 yr to explore pollinator dependence and pollination deficit in field-grown courgette in the United Kingdom. Results showed that pollination increased yield by 39% and there was no evidence of pollination limitation on crop yield. This was evidenced by a surprisingly low pollination deficit (of just 3%) and no statistical difference in yield (length grown, circumference, and weight) between open- and hand-pollinated crops. Nonetheless, the high economic value of courgettes means that reducing even the small pollination deficit could still increase profit by similar to 166 pound/ha. Interestingly, 56% of fruit was able to reach marketable size and shape without any pollination.

This species swarms frequently and is extremely successful in urban environments. In addition, it is one of the most popular stingless bee species for beekeeping in Latin America, so nest transportation and trading is common. Nest transportation can change the genetic structure of the host population, reducing inbreeding and increasing homogenization. Here, we evaluate the genetic structure of 17 geographic populations of T. angustula in southern Brazil to quantify the level of genetic differentiation between populations. Analyses were conducted on partially sequenced mitochondrial genes and 11 microsatellite loci of 1002 workers from 457 sites distributed on the mainland and on 3 islands. Our results show that T. angustula populations are highly differentiated as demonstrated by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite markers. Of 73 haplotypes, 67 were population-specific. MtDNA diversity was low in 9 populations but microsatellite diversity was moderate to high in all populations. Microsatellite data suggest 10 genetic clusters and low level of gene flow throughout the studied area. However, physical barriers, such as rivers and mountain ranges, or the presence or absence of forest appear to be unrelated to population clusters. Factors such as low dispersal, different ecological conditions, and isolation by distance are most likely shaping the population structure of this species. Thus far, nest transportation has not influenced the general population structure in the studied area.

Built in 1986, the Balbina Dam resulted in a vast archipelagic landscape containing 3546 primary forest islands of varying sizes and isolation, surrounded by 3129 km(2) of freshwater. Using scent traps, we sampled 34 islands, 14 open-water matrix sites, and three mainland continuous forests, yielding 2870 male orchid bees representing 25 species. Local orchid bee species richness was affected by forest patch area but particularly by site isolation. Distance to forest edges, either within forest areas or into the open-water matrix, was the most important predictor of species richness and composition. Variation in matrix dispersal of individual species to increasingly isolated sites was a key determinant of community structure.

The ABC-PSO algorithm has been optimized to achieve small cost function that are powered using the IEEE 802.21 standard taking into account different available wireless networks, the application requirements and the user preferences to improve QoS. Numerical results demonstrate that the ABC-PSO algorithm compared to the related work has lower cost and delay, higher available bandwidth and less number of handover. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The innate immune system includes the circulating hemocytes (immune cells) that clear pathogens from hemolymph (blood) by phagocytosis, nodulation or encapsulation. Honey bee hemocyte numbers have been linked to hemolymph levels of vitellogenin. Vitellogenin is a multifunctional protein with immune-supportive functions identified in a range of species, including the honey bee. Hemocyte numbers can increase via mitosis, and this recruitment process can be important for immune system function and maintenance. Here, we tested if hemocyte mediated phagocytosis differs among the physiologically different honey bee worker castes (nurses, foragers and winter bees), and study possible interactions with vitellogenin and hemocyte recruitment. To this end, we adapted phagocytosis assays, which-together with confocal microscopy and flow cytometry-allow qualitative and quantitative assessment of hemocyte performance. We found that nurses are more efficient in phagocytic uptake than both foragers and winter bees. We detected vitellogenin within the hemocytes, and found that winter bees have the highest numbers of vitellogenin-positive hemocytes. Connections between phagocytosis, hemocyte-vitellogenin and mitosis were worker caste dependent. Our results demonstrate that the phagocytic performance of immune cells differs significantly between honey bee worker castes, and support increased immune competence in nurses as compared to forager bees. Our data, moreover, provides support for roles of vitellogenin in hemocyte activity.",,,,,"Salmela, Heli/0000-0002-6917-2922",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Sep-06,2017,12,9,,,,,,,e0184108,10.1371/journal.pone.0184108,,,,,,,WOS:000409391200064,28877227,,,,

However, little attention has been paid to man-made structures that can moderate spatial processes affecting pollinator communities. In a large-scale study, we explored the importance of railway embankments for the turnover of pollinator species in agricultural landscapes. Because species differ in vulnerability to landscape composition and patch configuration, we also accounted for body size as well as food specialization of pollinators. Location: Krakow area, Poland. Methods: We sampled pollinating insects (bees, butterflies and hoverflies), at 25 study sites located along railway lines in the region of Krakow, Poland. Control grasslands for the embankments included 19 patches, located among crop fields, in which pollinators were sampled. We assessed the relationships between dissimilarity and distance for bee, butterfly and hoverfly trait groups on embankments and grasslands using Moran's Eigenvector Maps. Results: The dissimilarity for food-non-specialized bees on embankments was spatially structured: sites that were closer together were also less dissimilar in their community composition than more distant ones. Dissimilarity was also spatially aligned for large-bodied butterflies and hoverflies on embankments. The species dissimilarity of pollinators divided into trait-based groups was not spatially structured on grasslands. Main conclusion: Our study highlights the potential function of railway embankments as corridors for at least some pollinator populations. Landscape managers should include railways in green networks to improve spatial processes linked with the distribution and turnover of pollinator species in agricultural landscapes. Thus, railway embankments and their correct management may be a good example of man-made alterations in the environment that meet the demands of both civilization and biodiversity conservation.",,,,"Moron, Dawid/A-8595-2010","Moron, Dawid/0000-0003-3692-7855; Lenda, Magdalena/0000-0001-7824-7220; Skorka, Piotr/0000-0002-3221-296X; Tryjanowski, Piotr/0000-0002-8358-0797; Skorka, Piotr/0000-0002-7486-2928",,,,,,,,,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,,,SEP,2017,23,9,,,,,1090,1097,,10.1111/ddi.12600,,,,,,,WOS:000408647600011,,,,,

However, the impact of short-and long-term temporal resource availability on biodiversity has been less explored. This is highly relevant in tropical agricultural systems for pollinators, as many foraging periods of pollinators extend beyond flowering of any single crop species. In this study, we sought to understand how bee communities in tropical agroecosystems changed between seasons, and if short-and long-term floral resource availability influenced their diversity and abundance. We used a threshold analysis approach in order to explore this relationship at two time scales. This study took place in a region dominated by coffee agroecosystems in Southern Mexico. This was an ideal system because the landscape offers a range of coffee management regimes that maintain heterogeneity in floral resource availability spatially and temporally. We found that the bee community varies significantly between seasons. There were higher abundances of native social, solitary and managed honey bees during the dry season when coffee flowers. Additionally, we found that floral resources from groundcover, but not trees, were associated with bee abundance. Further, the temporal scale of the availability of these resources is important, whereby short-term floral resource availability appears particularly important in maintaining high bee abundance at sites with lower seasonal complementarity. We argue that in addition to spatial resource heterogeneity, temporal resource heterogeneity is critical in explaining bee community patterns, and should thus be considered to promote pollinator conservation.",,,,,"Fisher, Kaleigh/0000-0003-1395-2484",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,SEP,2017,27,6,,,,,1815,1826,,10.1002/eap.1568,,,,,,,WOS:000408814800009,28464529,,,,

Hedgerows are an important component of the landscape in many farming systems across the world, management of which provides a potential mechanism to enhance ecological intensification. Here we investigate the value of hedgerows in Southern England as a source of functionally important taxa, and how hedgerow quality and local landscape composition impact on their potential contribution to sustainable agriculture in arable landscapes. We show that hedgerows are a source habitat for many natural enemies which spill over into neighbouring fields, and that hedgerows provide a valuable forage resource and corridor for movement of pollinators. Hedgerow quality affects these benefits and continuous unbroken hedgerows, with a high diversity of woody species, are more valuable for the provision of bumblebees and Linyphiid spiders, while the presence of trees within the hedgerow supports Lycosid spiders. Floral resources, beyond the woody hedgerow species themselves, are also a key forage resource for hoverflies. The impact of these hedgerows on invertebrate abundance is moderated by local landscape, and hedgerows are a more valuable forage resource for pollinators in more intensely managed landscapes. Our study shows that in order to support abundant and a broad range of natural enemies and pollinators in agricultural landscapes, both hedgerows and local semi-natural habitats need to be protected and managed. The benefit of hedgerows, as a habitat for functionally important taxa depends on hedgerow quality and management practices such as avoiding gaps, high hedge species diversity and maintaining an abundant understory of plants, can improve their value for ecological intensification.",,,,"Mortimer, Simon R/B-5154-2008; Senapathi, Deepa/F-1952-2014; Potts, Simon G/C-7250-2008","Mortimer, Simon R/0000-0001-6160-6741; Senapathi, Deepa/0000-0002-8883-1583; Potts, Simon G/0000-0002-2045-980X; Garratt, Michael/0000-0002-0196-6013",,,,,,,,,,,,0167-8809,1873-2305,,,,Sep-01,2017,247,,,,,,363,370,,10.1016/j.agee.2017.06.048,,,,,,,WOS:000408597800040,,,,,

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Serratula tinctoria L. that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Serratula tinctoria is a gynodioecious perennial forb of open or semi-shaded habitats including grassland, heath, mire, open woodland and scrub and their ecotones. It is found throughout most of England and Wales but it is very rare in Scotland and absent from Ireland. Serratula tinctoria is found in Europe as far north as southern Sweden and Norway. It is absent from much of the Boreal biogeographical zone, including most of Fennoscandia and northern Poland, Russia and the Baltic States, and from the lowland Mediterranean zone. 3. Serratula tinctoria occurs on soils overlying a wide variety of superficial deposits and sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks, including ultramafic rocks. The pH range of these soils is wide, ranging from acidic to moderately alkaline but with nutrient status classed as oligotrophic, or more rarely mesotrophic. In mire or fen habitats, it occurs in topogenous or soligenous situations with a similar soil water pH range. It is able to tolerate a wide spectrum of soil water-table conditions, ranging from very dry to flooded. 4. Serratula tinctoria is pollinated by various insects of the orders Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera, particularly bumblebees, hoverflies and butterflies. It produces phytoecdysteroids, which mimic a hormone that regulates insect development. 5. The seed has a feathery pappus for wind dispersal and establishment is primarily from seed. However, it has strong dispersal limitation with slow migration rates into restored grasslands of 1 m year(-1). The species has a short-term persistent seed bank. Seedling recruitment is enhanced by disturbance that creates bare ground, increasing light flux and lower cover of bryophytes and litter, and reduced by higher nutrient availability and lack of management. 6. Formerly the source of a yellow dye, S. tinctoria has declined in Britain since at least the late 19th Century primarily due to a combination of drainage, ploughing and agricultural improvement and, conversely, lack of management by cutting and grazing in its grassland, heath and mire habitats. There is evidence that the decline slowed or stabilised between the late-1980s and the mid-2000s, in part due to the positive impact of conservation via statutory protection on designated sites and wider measures delivered through agri-environment schemes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,SEP,2017,105,5,,,,,1438,1458,,10.1111/1365-2745.12824,,,,,,,WOS:000407838200026,,,,,

The quantity and diversity of collected pollen can influence the growth and health of honey bee colonies, but little is known about the influence of landscape structure on pollen diet. In a field experiment, we rotated 16 honey bee colonies across 16 agricultural landscapes, used traps to collect samples of collected pollen and observed intra-colonial dance communication to gain information about foraging distances. DNA metabarcoding was applied to analyze mixed pollen samples. Neither the amount of collected pollen nor pollen diversity was related to landscape diversity. However, we found a strong seasonal variation in the amount and diversity of collected pollen in all sites independent of landscape diversity. The observed increase in foraging distances with decreasing landscape diversity suggests that honey bees compensated for lower landscape diversity by increasing their pollen foraging range in order to maintain pollen amount and diversity. Our results underscore the importance of a diverse pollen diet for honey bee colonies.

We describe an experiment that can help distinguish between these models. Participants wore a head-mounted display to carry out a homing task in immersive virtual reality. They viewed three long, thin, vertical poles and had to remember where they were in relation to the poles before being transported (virtually) to a new location in the scene from where they had to walk back to the original location. The experiment was conducted in both a richcue scene (a furnished room) and a sparse scene (no background and no floor or ceiling). As one would expect, in a rich-cue environment, the overall error was smaller, and in this case, the ability to separate the models was reduced. However, for the sparse-cue environment, the view-based model outperforms the reconstruction-based model.

Pollinator foraging varies with the diversity, abundance, and spatial configuration of floral resources. However, the implications of this variation for pollen transfer and ultimately the reproductive success of insect pollinated plants remains unclear, especially for species which are rare or isolated in the landscape. We used a landscape-scale experiment, coupled with microsatellite genotyping, to explore how the floral richness of habitats affected pollinator behavior and pollination effectiveness. Small arrays of the partially self-compatible plant Californian poppy (Eschscholzia californica) were introduced across a landscape gradient to simulate rare, spatially isolated populations. The effects on pollinator activity, outcrossing, and plant reproduction were measured. In florally rich habitats, we found reduced pollen movement between plants, leading to fewer long-distance pollination events, lower plant outcrossing, and a higher incidence of pollen limitation. This pattern indicates a potential reduction in per capita pollinator visitation, as suggested by the lower activity densities and richness of pollinators observed within florally rich habitats. In addition, seed production reduced by a factor of 1.8 in plants within florally rich habitats and progeny germination reduced by a factor of 1.2. We show this to be a consequence of self-fertilization within the partially self-compatible plant, E. californica. These findings indicate that locally rare plants are at a competitive disadvantage within florally rich habitats because neighboring plant species disrupt conspecific mating by co-opting pollinators. Ultimately, this Allee effect may play an important role in determining the long-term persistence of rarer plants in the landscape, both in terms of seed production and viability. Community context therefore requires consideration when designing and implementing conservation management for plants which are comparatively rare in the landscape.",,,,"Vanbergen, Adam J./I-6863-2012; Cavers, Stephen/B-7806-2010","Vanbergen, Adam J./0000-0001-8320-5535; Cavers, Stephen/0000-0003-2139-9236",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,AUG,2017,7,16,,,,,6507,6518,,10.1002/ece3.3186,,,,,,,WOS:000409528000040,28861252,,,,

Although relatively modest in terms of species richness, the Vespidae include species spanning much of the known range of animal social complexity, from solitary nesters to highly eusocial species with some of the largest known colonies and multiple reproductives. Eusocial species differ in behavior and ecology including variation in queen/worker caste differentiation and in diurnal/nocturnal activity. Species differences in overall brain size are strongly associated with brain allometry; relative sizes of visual processing tissues increase at faster rates than antennal processing tissues. The lower relative size of the central-processing mushroom bodies (MB) in eusocial species compared to solitary relatives suggests sociality may relax demands on individual cognitive abilities. However, queens have greater relative MB volumes than their workers, and MB development is positively associated with social dominance status in some species.

We used species distribution models (SDMs) and multivariate analyses to evaluate whether these occurrences represent new escapes from managed colonies or natural dispersal of the species from its southern invaded range. These reports of B. terrestris indicate a northward expansion of this bee. In our analyses, these new areas of occurrences have environmental conditions similar to those observed in the species' southern invaded range, and our SDMs predict that B. terrestris dispersal through the Atacama is possible, although not likely given the occasional flower blooming in that region of Chile.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of landscape context at multiple spatial scales on the abundance of bee pollinators of tomato crops in Brazil. Pollinator abundance was obtained from tomato crops grown in a conventional system in the Cerrado region. Around each tomato field circular buffers of 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 km radius were defined. Inside each buffer the landscapes were manually classified into native and non-native cover and, the proportion of native vegetation, the relative largest patch size, and the distance of the nearest native vegetation to each field were calculated. Pollinator species were categorized into five groups: Exomalopsis, Centris, Bombus/Eulaema, Halictidae, and all buzz pollinators combined (Buzzers). The results showed that the landscape context influenced the abundance of the five groups of tomato pollinators. Bees with a smaller body size, such as Exomalopsis spp., responded at smaller scales, while bees with a larger body size, such as the Centris and Bombus/Eulaema groups, responded at larger scales. The abundance of all pollinator groups increased with native vegetation cover. Most groups showed higher abundances in landscapes with similar-size fragments.

However, links between pollinator activity and multiple paternity are generally lacking, especially for plant species that attract functionally diverse floral visitors. In this study, we separated the influence of two functionally distinct floral visitors (hawkmoths and solitary bees) and characterized their impacts on multiple paternity in a self-incompatible, annual forb, Oenothera harringtonii (Onagraceae). We also situated pollinator-mediated effects in a spatial context by linking variation in multiple paternity to variation in plant spatial isolation. We documented pronounced differences in the number of paternal sires as function of pollinator identity: on average, the primary pollinator (hawkmoths) facilitated mating with nearly twice as many pollen donors relative to the secondary pollinator (solitary bees). This effect was consistent for both isolated and nonisolated individuals, but spatial isolation imposed pronounced reductions on multiple paternity regardless of pollinator identity. Considering that pollinator abundance and pollen dispersal distance did not vary significantly with pollinator identity, we attribute variation in realized mating dynamics primarily to differences in pollinator morphology and behaviour as opposed to pollinator abundance or mating incompatibility arising from underlying spatial genetic structure. Our findings demonstrate that functionally distinct pollinators can have strongly divergent effects on polyandry in plants and further suggest that both pollinator identity and spatial heterogeneity have important roles in plant mating dynamics.",,,,"Fant, Jeremie B/AAA-4962-2019","Fant, Jeremie B/0000-0001-9276-1111; Skogen, Krissa/0000-0002-7868-9632",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,AUG,2017,26,16,,,,,4296,4308,,10.1111/mec.14115,,,,,,,WOS:000407255100014,28334485,,,,

Wolbachia has been found worldwide as an arthropod parasite/mutualist symbiont in a wide range of species, including insects. Differing effects have been identified on physiology and behavior by Wolbachia. However, the effect of Wolbachia infection on the learning ability of their host had never previously been studied. The current study carried out to compare learning ability and memory duration in 2 strains of the parasitoid Trichogramma brassicae: 1 uninfected and 1 infected by Wolbachia. Both strains were able to associate the novel odors with the reward of an oviposition into a host egg. However, the percentage of females that responded to the experimental design and displayed an ability to learn in these conditions was higher in the uninfected strain. Memory duration was longer in uninfected wasps (23.8 and 21.4 h after conditioning with peppermint and lemon, respectively) than in infected wasps (18.9 and 16.2 h after conditioning with peppermint and lemon, respectively). Memory retention increased in response to the number of conditioning sessions in both strains, but memory retention was always shorter in the infected wasps than in the uninfected ones. Wolbachia infection may select for reduced memory retention because shorter memory induces infected wasps to disperse in new environments and avoid competition with uninfected wasps by forgetting cues related to previously visited environments, thus increasing transmission of Wolbachia in new environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1672-9609,1744-7917,,,,AUG,2017,24,4,,,,,569,583,,10.1111/1744-7917.12348,,,,,,,WOS:000406477400004,27090067,,,,

The ability of pollinating insects to discover and evade their predators can affect plant-pollinator mutualisms and have cascading ecosystem effects. Pollinators will avoid flowers with predators, but it is not clear how far away they will move to continue foraging. If these distances are relatively small, the impact of predators on the plant-pollinator mutualism may be lessened. The plant could continue to receive some pollination, and pollinators would reduce the time and energy needed to search for another patch. 2. A native crab spider, Xysticus elegans, was placed on one cluster in a small array of Baccharis pilularis inflorescence clusters, and the preferred short-range foraging distances of naturally visiting pollinators was determined. 3. Nearly all pollinator taxa (honey bees, wasps, other Hymenoptera, and non-bombyliid flies) spent less time foraging on the predator cluster. 4. The key result of this study is that inflorescences within 90 mm of the crab spider were avoided by visiting honey bees and wasps, which spent three-and 18-fold more time, respectively, foraging on more distant flower clusters. 5. Whether honey bees can use olfaction to detect spiders was then tested, and this study provides the first demonstration that honey bees will avoid crab spider odour alone at a food source.",,,,"Nieh, James/H-8705-2014","Nieh, James/0000-0001-6237-0726",,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,1365-2311,,,,AUG,2017,42,4,,,,,469,476,,10.1111/een.12406,,,,,,,WOS:000406345700011,,,,,

Here we assess the relationships between landscape context, pollinator communities (density and diversity) and pollination of oilseed rape in 18 landscapes with proportions of small-holder farming ranging from 10% to 70% in southern China. To quantify the contribution of pollinators to oilseed rape yield, we manipulated pollinator access in a focal oilseed rape field in each landscape using open and closed cages. The pollinator communities in the focal fields were sampled using pan traps. The abundance of wild pollinators increased significantly with the proportion of cultivated land, but the diversity of the wild pollinator communities declined. The responses of pollinator abundance and diversity to cultivated land were best explained at scales of around 1000 m. The abundance of the unmanaged honey bee Apis cerana was positively associated with the proportion of cultivated land, whereas the abundance of the managed A. mellifera was not. A pollination services index (PSI) was calculated by comparing the reproductive investment in seeds between plants with or without pollinator access. PSI was positively correlated with wild pollinator abundance, but not with the abundance of honeybee species. PSI was also not significantly correlated with the area proportion of cultivated land.

Pollinators utilise different habitats to meet resource requirements throughout their life-span and it is widely accepted that their conservation requires a landscape-scale approach. Information on the mechanisms driving insect pollinators at the landscape scale is, however, lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, this novel study explores how pollinators utilise different habitats within a landscape and how utilisation changes over the season. Floral resources and insect pollinators (i.e. bumblebee, butterflies and hoverflies) were monitored during peak pollinator activity periods on a wide range of agricultural and semi-natural habitats in an intensive grassland landscape. The availability of key foraging resources differed between semi-natural habitats and this was strongly linked to their utilisation by pollinators. Floral resources were most abundant and diverse in road verges, riparian buffer strips and open scrub. These were key habitats for butterflies, with road verges and buffer strips also being important for hoverflies and bumblebees. The relative value of semi-natural habitats in providing floral resources changed throughout the season. Pollinators appeared to respond to changes in key floral resources, dynamically using different semi-natural habitats to meet their requirements. Maintaining landscape heterogeneity and improving the quality of semi-natural habitats to ensure resource diversity and continuity is fundamental to pollinator conservation. Regionally targeting agri-environment spending could result in the simplification of agricultural landscapes with consequences on insect pollinators and biodiversity as a whole.",,,,"Brocklehurst, Sarah/J-3733-2013; McCracken, David I/G-6869-2012","Brocklehurst, Sarah/0000-0002-1636-1017; McCracken, David I/0000-0001-5057-0448; Cole, Lorna/0000-0002-3929-0530",,,,,,,,,,,,0167-8809,1873-2305,,,,Aug-01,2017,246,,,,,,157,167,,10.1016/j.agee.2017.05.007,,,,,,,WOS:000405973000018,,,,,

Eduard",,,Individual versus collective decision making: optimal foraging in the group-hunting termite specialist Megaponera analis,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,,,,,,,,,,,,"Collective decision making is one of the main mechanisms of organization in social insects. However, individual decision making can also play an important role, depending on the type of foraging behaviour. In the termite-hunting ant species Megaponera analis information about foraging sites is collected by only a handful of individual scouts that have to convey this information to the colony as accurately as possible to optimize their foraging behaviour. We therefore looked at predictions made by optimal foraging theory to better understand the interplay between collective and individual decision making in this obligate group-raiding predator. We found a clear positive relation between raid size (200-500 ants) and termite abundance at the foraging site thereby confirming predictions of the maximization of energy theory. Furthermore, selectivity of the food source increased with distance, thus confirming central place prediction theory. The confirmation of these theories suggests that individual scouts must be the main driver behind raid size, choice and raiding behaviour. The marginal value theorem was also confirmed by our results: time spent at the hunting ground increased with distance and prey quantity. This raises questions on how foraging time at the food source is regulated in a group-hunting predator. Hunger decreased selectivity of scouts with respect to food sources, while average raid size increased and more scouts left the nest in search of prey, thus implying that scouts are aware of the hunger state of the colony and adapt their decision making accordingly. Remarkably, most central place foraging behaviours in M. analis were not achieved by collective decisions but rather by individual decisions of scout ants. Thus, 1% of the colony (10-20 scouts) decided the fate and foraging efficiency of the remaining 99%. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, little attention has been devoted to the study of this aspect in social insects. A recent study based on a single day of observation showed that colony members of the paper wasp Polistes dominula were spatially arranged on the comb in a predictable way. Alpha females patrolled a small central area of the comb, while subordinates and workers were mostly active in the nest periphery. The present study investigated the existence of a spatial-temporal polyethism in P. dominula by studying whether workers and foundresses change their within-nest spatial behaviour over their lifespan. The results showed that while the age of a worker weakly influenced the probability that she performed a within-nest task or foraged outside, it did not account for any aspect of the wasp's within-nest spatial behaviour. Precisely, the size of the patrolled area, the position on the comb, and the rate of superimposition with other nestmates were all not related to the age of the wasp. Moreover, no evident spatial segregation between young and old individuals occurred on the comb. These findings suggest that other proximate mechanisms underlie the observed colony spatial organization. As the reproductive division of labour was the only factor affecting wasp spatial sorting within the nest, dominance hierarchy and social interactions between and within foundress and workers represent good candidates responsible for the colony's spatial organization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0020-1812,1420-9098,,,,AUG,2017,64,3,,,,,379,385,,10.1007/s00040-017-0557-8,,,,,,,WOS:000405674800009,,,,,

Foragers danced for small, nearby patches of pollen resources during the cool dormant season but danced for 1.6-2.7-fold more distant and more widely dispersed resources during the hot dry season, a time of seasonal drought and floral dearth. Individual foragers collected pollen from a wide variety of species, but colonies focused recruitment on a small subset of common species in flower during each season: 2.7, 6.3, and 10% of all species in bloom during the dormant, growth, and dry seasons, respectively. Pollen foragers danced almost exclusively for cold-adapted native species during the dormant season, equally for native and non-native plants during the short growth season, and primarily for non-native ornamental species during the dry season. Our results suggest that honey bee recruitment behavior and dietary breadth may be influenced by seasonal changes in pollen resources.

This hypothesis implies likely pollinator switches between the yellowand purple-flowering plant individuals. However, pollen flow within and between morphs has never been tested by means of pollen tracking in a dimorphic population under field conditions. We studied a dimorphic population located in the southern ""Wienerwald""-region to obtain frequencies of inter-and intra-morph pollinator switches. Pollinia were marked using dye powder to observe pollen flow, i.e. the spatial distribution of pollen, pollen export and deposition (i.e. male and female reproductive success) as well as the transport distances from donator to receptor plants. For analysing the switching behaviour of pollinators, we labelled yellow-and purple-flowering individuals morph-specifically using two different dye colours. In our study system, yellow-flowering plants were dominant (70% in 2006; 67% in 2014). We labelled 582 pollinia from yellow-and 239 from purple-flowering individuals reflecting the yellowdominance (71%). In total, 473 marked pollinia were exported, of which 72.3% originated from yellow flowers. We found that movements of pollinators from yellow to yellow (YY) flowers dominate (93 of all 155 deposits of labelled pollen) the four possible pollination events by far. Even given the dominance of yellow-flowering plants in our study population, only 70 respective events (out of 155) would have been expected, if switching behaviour was by chance. Therefore, the assumption that pollinators alternate randomly between colour morphs was not supported by our results. The longest pollen transport distance observed was 237m. Moreover, 135 manually conducted cross-pollinations on 47 individuals were evaluated: seed viability analyses indicated no differences between the four possible crosses. Therefore, the dominance of the yellow morph at our study site could be the primary result of the most frequently observed cross-combination (i.e. YY). (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Bee abundance and raw richness increased with restoration age from the low level of the pre-restoration (agricultural) sites to the target level of the remnant prairie within the first 2-3 years after restoration, and these high levels were maintained throughout the entire restoration chronosequence. Bee community composition of the youngest restored sites differed from that of prairie remnants, but 5-7 years post-restoration the community composition of restored prairie converged with that of remnants. Landscape context, particularly nearby wooded land, was found to affect abundance, rarefied richness, and community composition. Partitioning overall beta diversity between sites into species replacement and richness effects revealed that the main driver of community change over time was the gradual accumulation of species, rather than one-to-one species replacement.

If correct, this could unify our understanding of dance following, provide insight into dance information transfer, and offer a way to identify the signal receivers of tremble dance information. Followers showed similar initial attraction to and tracking of dancers. However, waggle dancers were faster than tremble dancers, and follower-forward, -sideways, and -angular velocities were generally similar to the velocities of their respective dancers. Waggle dancers attracted followers from 1.3-fold greater distances away than tremble dancers. Both follower types were attracted to the lateral sides of dancers, but tremble followers were more attracted to the dancer's head, and waggle followers were more attracted to the dancer's abdomen. Tremble dancers engaged in 4-fold more brief food exchanges with their followers than waggle dancers. The behaviors of both follower types are therefore relatively conserved. Researchers can now take the next steps, observing tremble followers to determine their subsequent behaviors and testing the broader question of whether follower attraction and tracking is conserved in a wide range of social insects.",,,,"Nieh, James/H-8705-2014","Nieh, James/0000-0001-6237-0726; Landgraf, Tim/0000-0003-4951-5235",,,,,,,,,,,,2046-6390,,,,,Jun-15,2017,6,6,,,,,810,817,,10.1242/bio.025445,,,,,,,WOS:000403449400009,28432104,,,,

Silviculture is a key source of disturbance in the eastern USA and thus, developing a better understanding of its ramifications for these keystone species is important for effective ecosystem conservation. We sampled bees in 30 forest openings created by group selection harvest as well as 30 sites in adjacent mature forest to examine the extent to which small forest openings support bees, to identify environmental variables influencing bee abundance and diversity, and to gauge their potential to augment bee populations in adjacent unmanaged forest. Bees were significantly more abundant and diverse in forest openings than in mature forest, but species composition did not differ. There was no relationship between opening size and abundance or diversity of bees in openings or adjacent mature forest. Both abundance and diversity were generally positively related to the amount of early-successional habitat on the landscape. Within openings, overall abundance and diversity decreased with vegetation height and increased with a metric representing floral richness and abundance. Notably, social, soft-wood-nesting, and small bees exhibited the opposite pattern in adjacent forest, increasing with vegetation height in openings and decreasing with greater floral richness and abundance within openings. Our results suggest that the creation of small forest openings helps to promote bees both in openings and adjacent mature forest, but this pattern is not consistent for all guilds.

An optical tracking system is designed based on the principle of stereo vision with high-precision and low cost. This system uses optical infrared LEDs that are installed on the surgical instrument as markers and a near-infrared filter is added in front of the Bumblebee2 stereo camera lens to eliminate the interference of ambient light. The algorithm based on the region growing method is designed and used for the marker's pixel coordinates' extraction. In this algorithm, the singular points are eliminated and the gray centroid method is applied to solve the pixel coordinate of the marker's center. Then, the marker's matching algorithm is adopted and three-dimensional coordinates' reconstruction is applied to derive the coordinates of the surgical instrument tip in the world coordinate system. In the simulation, the stability, accuracy, rotation tests, and the tracking angle and area range were carried out for a typical surgical instrument and the miniature surgical instrument. The simulation results show that the proposed optical tracking system has high accuracy and stability. It can meet the requirements of surgical navigation. (C) The Authors.

To assess success in restoring not only biodiversity, but also functionality of communities, we should take into account the re-assembly of species trait composition across taxa. Attaining such functional restoration would depend on the landscape context, vegetation structure, and time since restoration. We assessed how trait composition of plant and pollinator (bee and hoverfly) communities differ between abandoned, restored (formerly abandoned) or continuously grazed (intact) semi-natural pastures. In restored pastures, we also explored trait composition in relation to landscape context, vegetation structure, and pasture management history. Abandoned pastures differed from intact and restored pastures in trait composition of plant communities, and as expected, had lower abundances of species with traits associated with grazing adaptations. Further, plant trait composition in restored pastures became increasingly similar to that in intact pastures with increasing time since restoration. On the contrary, the trait composition of pollinator communities in both abandoned and restored pastures remained similar to intact pastures. The trait composition for both bees and hoverflies was influenced by flower abundance and, for bees, by connectivity to other intact grasslands in the landscape. The divergent responses across organism groups appeared to be mainly related to the limited dispersal ability and long individual life span in plants, the high mobility of pollinators, and the dependency of semi-natural habitat for bees. Our results, encompassing restoration effects on trait composition for multiple taxa along a gradient in both time (time since restoration) and space (connectivity), reveal how interacting communities of plants and pollinators are shaped by different trait-environmental relationships.

For example, fungicides are often applied in combination with other products to control fungal pathogens during almond bloom. However, the effects of fungicides on honey bee health have been so far understudied. To assess the effects of some of the top fungicides used during the 2012 California almond bloom on honey bee forager mortality, we collected foragers from a local apiary and exposed them to fungicides (alone and in various combinations) at the label dose, or at doses ranging from 0.25 to 2 times the label dose rate. These fungicides were Iprodione 2SE Select, Pristine, and Quadris. We utilized a wind tunnel and atomizer set up with a wind speed of 2.9 m/s to simulate field-relevant exposure of honey bees to these agrochemicals during aerial application in almond fields. Groups of 40-50 foragers exposed to either untreated controls or fungicide-laden treatments were monitored daily over a 10-d period.

In Finland, these statistics are available at aggregate national level, and at the level of each of the 15 provinces of the country. Yields of wind-pollinated crops have steadily increased in Finland, while yields of insect-pollinated crops have been highly variable. The largest crop benefitting from insect pollination is turnip rapeseed, which shows first a clear tendency to increased yields from 1980 to 1993, after which there has been a continuous decline in yields at the national average level. Regionally, the trends in turnip rapeseed yield show large variation, so that in six provinces of Finland, the trend has been significantly decreasing; in five provinces, there has been no significant trend; and in two provinces, there has been a significant linear increase in yields. Yield trends in the two other insect-pollinated crops, caraway and black currants, show similar trend variations. However, at the national average level, caraway yields show no significant trend, while black currant yields have increased during the past 6 years. The possible impact on the trends of insect-pollinated crops of three explanatory variables was analyzed. Significant linear correlation was found between the yield trends (slope of the trends) in rapeseed, and the extent of using neonicotinoid seed dressing in the provinces; the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed increased, as the use of neonicotinoid seed dressing increased. Similar significant linear correlation was found for the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed and the complexity of the agricultural landscape in each province; yield trend changed from negative to positive as the proportion of agricultural land of the total terrestrial land area declined from 28% to below 10%. The availability of honey bee colonies with respect to the growing area of crops benefitting from insect pollination also had a linear, significant impact on turnip rapeseed yield trends: yields tended to decline in provinces, where the supply of managed pollinators with respect to demand was low, but tended to increase in provinces, where the number of honey bee colonies were over 30% of the estimated demand. As neither the landscape complexity (proportion of arable land of total terrestrial land area), nor the number of honey bee colonies for pollination have changed significantly over the past 10-20 years, these factors cannot explain the observed differences in the yield trends of the examined insect-pollinated crops. It appears that only the uptake of neonicotinoid insecticide seed dressing about 15 years ago can explain the crop yield declines in several provinces, and at the national level for turnip rapeseed, most likely via disruption of pollination services by wild pollinators.",,,,"Serrano, Jose/A-2854-2009","Serrano, Jose/0000-0002-1565-5216",,,,,,,,,,,,1872-8855,1872-8847,,,,JUN,2017,11,3,,,SI,,449,461,,10.1007/s11829-017-9527-3,,,,,,,WOS:000401742400020,,,,,

Furthermore, we discovered that B. sylvicola populations distributed on the Olympic Peninsula have significantly less average allelic diversity than populations distributed in the Cascade Mountains. Our results suggest that populations distributed in the Olympic Mountains represent a distinct genetic cluster relative to the Cascade Mountains, with B. sylvicola and B. mixtus likely experiencing the greatest degree of population genetic differentiation relative to B. flavifrons and B. melanopygus.

We then assess the suitability of multi-local or extensive conservation to ensure their long-term survival. Results based on inter-population differences show only two out of nine species with significant IBD. European bee populations seem quite connected when their IBD is compared to IBD of other phyla. However, our results based on inter-individual distances show that eight out of nine species display significant IBD. These different results are presumably a consequence of potential limitations of the inter-population approach. Therefore, we speculate that the inter-population approach could result in inaccurate IBD estimations.

Evaluating ""multi-scale"" responses of species to landscape structure is an important framework to be considered, allowing insights about habitat requirements for different groups. We evaluated the response of Brazilian Cerrado's bees (eusocial vs. solitary ones) to both the amount and isolation of remnant vegetation in eight nested multiple-local scales. Response variables included abundance, observed, and estimated species richness, and beta diversity (split into nestedness and turnover resultant dissimilarities). Eusocial species' abundance responded to landscape structure at narrow scales of fragment isolation (250 m of radius from sampling sites), while solitary species' abundance responded to broader scales to fragment area (2000 m). Eusocial species nestedness also responded to landscape features in broader scales (1500 m), especially to increasing fragment isolation. However, all the remaining response variables did not respond to any other landscape variables in any spatial scale considered. Such contrasting responses of the abundances of eusocial vs. solitary species are related to the inherent life-history traits of each group. Important attributes in this context are different requirements on food resources, population features, and flight abilities. Species-specific dispersal abilities may be the main determinants of the nested patterns found for eusocial species at 1500 m. Considering these results, we suggest that different bee groups are considered separately in further landscape analyses, especially in other Brazilian biomes, for a better understanding of landscape effects on these organisms.",,,,"De Marco, Paulo/B-2209-2009; Nogueira, Denis/J-4889-2016; Silva, Daniel Paiva/F-8052-2010","De Marco, Paulo/0000-0002-3628-6405; Nogueira, Denis/0000-0001-8893-7903; Silva, Daniel Paiva/0000-0002-2457-6245",,,,,,,,,,,,1519-566X,1678-8052,,,,JUN,2017,46,3,,,,,264,274,,10.1007/s13744-016-0461-3,,,,,,,WOS:000402734700003,27909951,,,,

The rich angiosperm diversity stems from several factors including variations in geographical distribution and floral morphology, which tend to correlate with different pollinator preference in many taxa. Pollinator diversity varies among different regions, thus range shifts can play an important role in increasing divergence by predisposing clades to floral shifts. Antirrhineae is an ideal model to examine the effect of range shifts and pollination modes on diversification, because the tribe is distributed in the Old World and the New World with representatives exhibiting hummingbird pollination in the New World, and bee pollination in the Old World and the New World. Using ancestral reconstructions and phylogenetic modeling, this study investigated the effects of geographic distribution and pollination modes on the macroevolution of the tribe Antirrhineae. Our age-range correlation analysis showed young nodes had more range overlap than older nodes in the phylogeny, suggesting sympatric speciation as a contributing factor to the diversification of the tribe. We observed similar rates of diversification throughout time with no evident rate shifts within the tribe. Old World and New World lineages have similar speciation rates in Antirrhineae, and pollination mode did not have a significant effect on the diversification of the tribe. However, we found evidence for increased diversification rates through long-distance dispersal events, which occurred between the Old World and the New World four times throughout the evolutionary history of Antirrhineae.

Persistence in fragmented landscapes depends on the maintenance of connectivity among populations, without which genetic diversity may decrease and lead to population declines. Bees are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of low genetic diversity so it is important to understand patterns of dispersal for native bees living in fragmented areas. I used population genetic techniques to characterize patterns of genetic diversity and dispersal for the orchid bee Euglossa imperialis within and among forest fragments in southern Costa Rica, in which the furthest two fragments were 226 km from one another. In addition, I compared results of population genetic analyses conducted with all bees sampled, and results from analyses conducted with a reduced dataset containing only one individual per full sibling family from each site. For both datasets genetic diversity was low within forest fragments, with expected heterozygosity averaging 0.28 for the full dataset and 0.29 for the dataset containing only one full sibling per site. I found no evidence that deforested areas restricted dispersal; pairwise estimates of genetic differentiation among forest fragments averaged 0.01 for the full dataset, and 0 for the dataset containing only one full sibling per site. Genetic distance among sites within forest fragments was significantly correlated to geographic distance for the full dataset, but there was no significant correlation for the dataset that contained only one individual from each full sibling family. This suggests that family structure can drive results of analyses of genetic structure, although reductions in sample sizes following removal of full siblings may have reduced power to detect genetic structure.

Unfortunately, the movements of bees are difficult to measure directly at ecologically relevant scales. A common strategy for quantifying the foraging ranges of social bees is to sample the genotypes of foragers across a landscape. Individual foragers can be assigned to colonies with polymorphic genetic markers, and the dispersion of siblings in space can be used to make inference about colony locations and foraging movements. Several previous studies have sampled sibling genotypes at discrete locations (for example, at regular points along a transect), rather than in continuous space. Restricting the collection of bees to discrete locations presents a number of considerations for sampling design and data analysis.

To evaluate the extent to which H. communis behaves as a generalist and would be able to adapt to novel North American environments, we compare the breadth of its climatic, floral, habitat, and nesting preferences between its native European range and sites where it was first discovered in southern Quebec, Canada. Specifically, we calculate the paired difference index, which approximates species generalism, from a set of bipartite networks linking Hylaeus Fabricius, 1793 species to their respective floral hosts and habitats. Results indicate that H. communis is the most adaptable bee of the European Hylaeus fauna and will likely acclimate to its new environment, being a greater generalist than an already widely established exotic bee, H. hyalinatus Smith, 1842. In southern Quebec, we find that, despite visiting a wide variety of flowering species, it exhibits a strong association with non-native plants and resides almost exclusively in urban settings.

In tunnel widths of 60 and 120 cm, bumblebees control their lateral position by balancing the magnitude of translational optic flow experienced in the lateral visual field of each eye. In wider tunnels, bumblebees use translational optic flow cues in the ventral visual field to control their lateral position and to steer along straight tracks. Our results also suggest that bumblebees prefer to fly over surfaces that provide strong ventral optic flow cues, rather than over featureless ones.

Interspecific mating between closely related species may then occur, with various outcomes ranging from hybridization to reproductive interference. In the case of the Eastern honey bee Apis cerana and the Western honey bee Apis mellifera, an additional possible reproductive outcome has been posited: interspecific sperm triggers queens to produce daughters from unfertilized eggs via thelytokous parthenogenesis. Such an outcome would go unnoticed in natural population mergers, as queens, which are polyandrous, are likely to mate with both conspecific and interspecific males. We performed reciprocal crosses between A. mellifera and A. cerana via artificial insemination, plus control inseminations of saline (five queens per species per treatment), and genetically assessed the sex and origin of any resulting offspring. Neither A. cerana nor A. mellifera queens produced viable female brood after receiving interspecific semen, indicating a high cost of interspecific mating for both species. In two A. cerana colonies headed by cross-inseminated queens, workers responded by activating ovaries and laying eggs that were mainly male but occasionally female (i.e. thelytokous, 2% of brood), despite the queen's continued presence in the nest. We conclude that thelytoky is not a consistent response to interspecific mating by queens of A. mellifera or A. cerana.

Like other stingless bees, this species plays an important ecological role as a pollinator. The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic structure and evolutionary history of P. seridoensis across its current geographic range. Workers from 84 nests from 17 localities were analyzed for COI and Cytb genic regions. The population structure tests (Bayesian phylogenetic inference, AMOVA and haplotype network) consistently characterized two haplogroups (northwestern and eastern), with little gene flow between them, generating a high differentiation between them as well as among the populations within each haplogroup. The Mantel test revealed no isolation by distance. No evidence of a potential geographic barrier in the present that could explain the diversification between the P. seridoensis haplogroups was found. However, Pleistocene climatic changes may explain this differentiation, since the initial time for the P. seridoensis lineages diversification took place during the mid-Pleistocene, specifically the interglacial period, when the biota is presumed to have been more associated with dry conditions and had more restricted, fragmented geographical distribution. This event may have driven diversification by isolating the two haplogroups. Otherwise, the climatic changes in the late Pleistocene must not have drastically affected the population dynamics of P. seridoensis, since the Bayesian Skyline Plot did not reveal any substantial fluctuation in effective population size in either haplogroup.

Honey bees can tolerate high levels of many of these toxic compounds, including the alkaloid nicotine, in their diet without incurring apparent fitness costs. Very little is known about the underlying detoxification processes mediating this tolerance. We examined the metabolic fate of nicotine in newly emerged worker bees using radiolabeled nicotine and LC-MS/MS analysis to determine the kinetic distribution profile of nicotine as well as the absence or presence and identity of any nicotine-derived metabolites. Nicotine metabolism was extensive; virtually no unmetabolised nicotine were recovered from the rectum. The major metabolite found was 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl) butanoic acid, the end product of 2'C-oxidation of nicotine. It is the first time that 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl) butanoic acid has been identified in an insect as a catabolite of nicotine. Lower levels of cotinine, cotinine N-oxide, 3'hydroxy-cotinine, nicotine N-oxide and norcotinine were also detected. Our results demonstrated that formation of 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl) butanoic acid is quantitatively the most significant pathway of nicotine metabolism in honey bees and that the rapid excretion of unmetabolised nicotine does not contribute significantly to nicotine tolerance in honey bees. In nicotine-tolerant insects that do not rely on the rapid excretion of nicotine like the Lepidoptera, it is possible that the 2'C-oxidation of nicotine is the conserved metabolic pathway instead of the generally assumed 5'C-oxidation pathway.

The objective of this research was to determine the environmental toxicity of insecticides, spanning five different modes of action used to control D. citri, to A. mellifera. The insecticides investigated were imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate, spinetoram and diflubenzuron. In laboratory experiments, LD50 values were determined and ranged from 0.10 to 0.53 ng/mu l for imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate and spinetoram. LD50 values for diflubenzuron were > 1000 ng/mu l. Also, a hazard quotient was determined and ranged from 1130.43 to 10893.27 for imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate, and spinetoram. This quotient was < 0.447 for diflubenzuron. In field experiments, residual activity of fenpropathrin and dimethoate applied to citrus caused significant mortality of A. mellifera 3 and 7 days after application. Spinetoram and imidacloprid were moderately toxic to A. mellifera at the recommended rates for D. citri. Diflubenzuron was not toxic to A. mellifera in the field as compared with untreated control plots. Phenoloxidase (PO) activity of A. mellifera was higher than in untreated controls when A. mellifera were exposed to 14 days old residues.

Pollination is a major ecosystem service in which insects, particularly bees, play an important role for the reproduction of most angiosperms. Currently, this service is considered under threat due to reported bee declines. Moderately urbanised areas could be important for pollinators and pollination; however, compared to agricultural and natural systems, they are poorly studied. 2. Here, we investigated the relative effects of local habitat quality and anthropogenic land use across an agricultural to urban gradient for local plant and flying insect communities. We quantified local flower visitor networks and related network architecture to these local and landscape factors using structural equationmodelling. Flower visitor network architecture is often assumed to act as a surrogate for the ecosystem service of pollination. To test this idea, we related network metrics to pollination of four experimental, insect pollinator-dependent plant species. 3. Overall, local land use markedly influenced plant and flying insect communities. Flower richness and bee richness were higher in urban compared to agricultural areas. Flower visitor network metrics (e.g. linkage density) increased with the proportion of urban area surrounding a site. Also, relative to agricultural areas, urban flower visitors were more generalised and foraged from a higher number of plant species, likely a consequence of higher urban flowering plant richness. However, urban bees also visited a lower proportion of the available flowering plants (higher specialisation). Surprisingly, linkage density, network specialisation and flower visitor generality were not related to pollination of our four experimental plants per se. Rather, it was the proportion of urban cover, flying insect abundance and bee richness that were positively related to pollination. 4. Our findings show strong effects of local land use on plant and flying insect communities and flower visitor interaction networks. We observed increased overall visitation rates and pollination services to our experimental plants in urban compared to agricultural areas, despite increased urban flower visitor generality. Indeed, flower visitor network metrics were a poor proxy of provision of the ecosystem service of pollination.

Cane toads were the most frequent visitors to apiaries, followed by bandicoots and corvid birds. Cane toads at apiaries were more abundant and in better body condition (i. e., larger mass relative to snout-urostyle length) than were toads at nearby control sites. Toads at beehives contained more prey items per stomach (mostly bees, which were never recorded in the stomachs of toads from other sites), and adult female toads at beehives had larger livers and ovaries relative to body size. We conclude that commercial apiaries attract cane toads, influence their diets, and increase their feeding rates and reproductive capacity. Like other habitat modifications wrought by agricultural activities, honey bee colonies provide resources that facilitate the spread of cane toads through an otherwise harsh landscape matrix.

While some native bumble bees species collect an increasing proportion of C. scoparius pollen with increasing C. scoparius density, this did not translate into an increased potential for pollination. Rather, measures of effective pollination decline with C. scoparius density. Overall, our results suggest that some bee species may be better at finding resources at highly invaded sites.

Nectar samples of six individuals per species were collected at seven sites in a 2 km radius from each target beehive and plated on YM-Agar to visualise the different morphotypes, which were then identified by sequencing a section of the 26S rDNA gene. Multivariate linear models were used to analyze the effects of all investigated factors on yeast occurrence per tree. Yeast distribution was mainly driven by host identity. The influence of the environmental factors (NO2, height of construction, soil sealing) strongly depended on the radius around the tree, similar to the distance of the sampled beehive. Incidence of specialist nectar-borne yeast species decreased with increasing pollution/urbanization index. Given that specialist yeast species gave way to generalist yeasts that have a reduced dependency on pollinators for between-flower dispersal, our results indicate that increased urbanization may restrict the movement of nectar-specialized yeasts, via limitations of pollinator foraging behavior.",,,,"Verbruggen, Erik/AAF-1018-2019; Rillig, Matthias C./AAE-6980-2019; Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009","Verbruggen, Erik/0000-0001-7015-1515; Rillig, Matthias C./0000-0003-3541-7853; Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,Mar-30,2017,7,,,,,,,,45315,10.1038/srep45315,,,,,,,WOS:000397815900001,28358006,,,,

A major cause of this decline is habitat loss due to agricultural intensification(3). A range of global and national initiatives aimed at restoring pollinator habitats and populations have been developed(4,5). However, the success of these initiatives depends critically upon understanding how landscape change affects key population-level parameters, such as survival between lifecycle stages(6), in target species. This knowledge is lacking for bumblebees, because of the difficulty of systematically finding and monitoring colonies in the wild. We used a combination of habitat manipulation, land-use and habitat surveys, molecular genetics(7) and demographic and spatial modelling to analyse between-year survival of family lineages in field populations of three bumblebee species. Here we show that the survival of family lineages from the summer worker to the spring queen stage in the following year increases significantly with the proportion of high-value foraging habitat, including spring floral resources, within 250-1,000 m of the natal colony. This provides evidence for a positive impact of habitat quality on survival and persistence between successive colony cycle stages in bumblebee populations.

However, the mechanisms by which landscape structure influences pollinator diversity are not well understood. Because flowering plants and pollinators are generally mutualistic, the impact of landscape structure on one can influence the diversity of the other directly or indirectly. Here, we examine the direct and indirect effects of landscape structure on plant and pollinator communities in the naturally patchy, dolomite glade grasslands of the Missouri Ozarks. We quantified landscape spatial structure and the richness of plants and flying invertebrate pollinators in 30 glades. Higher pollinator diversity was not directly related to greater landscape area and connectivity.

Here, we use an SNP-based assay using the plant DNA barcoding locus matK to characterize pollen carriage between cultivated Brassica napus and wild Brassica rapa in three sites across southern England. The assay differentiated B. napus and B. rapa pollen carried by honey bees (Apis melifera), bumblebees (Bombus spp.), mining bees (Andrena spp.) and hoverflies (Syrphidae) captured on B. napus plants 1-2 m from wild B. rapa, and on B. rapa plants at various distances from the crop . Apis individuals foraging on B. rapa and carrying B. napus pollen were rarely found beyond 10 m from the crop. However, Bombus and Andrena individuals captured on B. rapa occasionally carried crop pollen up to 300 m from the source field. Hoverflies carried less pollen overall but featured high proportions of B. napus pollen even at the most distant capture points. We predict that different pollinator species will evoke markedly different patterns of interspecific hybrid formation. We conclude that more exhaustive surveys of this kind will help parameterize future mechanistic models to predict the distribution of hybrids between Genetically Modified B. napus and B. rapa on a landscape scale.

Finally, by analysing waggle dances, we tested if forager size is linked to foraging distance, between and within colonies. We found that the size of foragers significantly increases over the foraging season. Swarming did not appear to affect worker size, but colony size was overall positively linked to wing length and leg width.

We describe a novel pollinator model predicting flower visitation rates by wild central-place foragers (e.g., nesting bees) in spatially explicit landscapes. The model goes beyond existing approaches by: (1) integrating preferential use of more rewarding floral and nesting resources; (2) considering population growth over time; (3) allowing different dispersal distances for workers and reproductives; (4) providing visitation rates for use in crop pollination models. We use the model to estimate the effect of establishing grassy field margins offering nesting resources and a low quantity of flower resources, and/or late-flowering flower strips offering no nesting resources but abundant flowers, on bumble bee populations and visitation rates to flowers in landscapes that differ in amounts of linear seminatural habitats and early mass-flowering crops. Flower strips were three times more effective in increasing pollinator populations and visitation rates than field margins, and this effect increased over time. Late-blooming flower strips increased early-season visitation rates, but decreased visitation rates in other late-season flowers. Increases in population size over time in response to flower strips and amounts of linear seminatural habitats reduced this apparent competition for pollinators. Our spatially explicit, process-based model generates emergent patterns reflecting empirical observations, such that adding flower resources may have contrasting short- and long-term effects due to apparent competition for pollinators and pollinator population size increase. It allows exploring these effects and comparing effect sizes in ways not possible with other existing models.

These declines may have significant ecological consequences, because bumblebees pollinate a large range of plant species. Our study was carried out in heathlands, open semi-natural habitats that have decreased considerably due to human activities. We analysed how floral resources affect bumblebee communities throughout the colony lifetime at three scales: plot scale, heathland patch scale, and landscape scale. Floral density at the plot scale and spruce plantations at the landscape scale influenced bumblebee communities. The abundance of bumblebees on ericaceous species was higher when the landscape included a substantial proportion of unsuitable foraging habitat (i.e., spruce plantations). Both life history traits and colony life cycle stage influenced bumblebee responses to the availability of floral resources. Bumblebees were more affected by floral resources during the colony development phase than during the nest-foundation or mating phases. Moreover, bumblebees of species that form large colonies needed larger quantities of favourable foraging habitat, compared with small-colony bees, and their proportion decreased in habitats dominated by spruce plantations. In conclusion, the conservation of plant-bumblebee interactions will require management at a larger spatial scale than the restricted protected habitats.

We suggest the neuropeptide families allatostatin A (AstA), allatotropin (AT), short neuropeptide F (sNPF), and tachykinin (TK) as potential candidates. Based on a neuropeptidomic analysis in Camponotus floridanus, nano-LC-ESI MS/MS was used to identify these neuropeptides biochemically in Cataglyphis fortis. Furthermore, we show that all identified peptide families are present in the central brain and ventral ganglia of C. fortis whereas in the retrocerebral complex only sNPF could be detected. Immunofluorescence staining against AstA, AT, and TK in the brain revealed arborizations of AstA- and TK-positive neurons in primary sensory processing centers and higher order integration centers, whereas AT immunoreactivity was restricted to the central complex, the antennal mechanosensory and motor center, and the protocerebrum. For artificially dark-kept ants, we found that TK distribution changed markedly in the central complex from days 1 and 7 to day 14 after eclosion. Based on functional studies in Drosophila, this age-related variation of TK is suggestive of a modulatory role in locomotion behavior in C. fortis. We conclude that the general distribution and age-related changes in neuropeptides indicate a modulatory role in sensory input regions and higher order processing centers in the desert ant brain. J.

In this study, we appraised results from taxonomy, genetics, phylogenetics, phylogeography and pollination ecology to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus Galvezia. Location Peru, continental Ecuador and Galapagos. Methods We sequenced the nuclear ribosomal ITS and two plastid regions, ndhF and ndhF-rpL32, to infer the origin of Galvezia and patterns of colonization to and across the Galapagos archipelago, based on Bayesian inference and statistical parsimony analyses. To investigate genetic diversity and differentiation within G.leucantha, we screened the genome of six populations and obtained 194 AFLP fingerprints. Autogamy tests and pollination network analyses were performed to evaluate the colonization potential and to investigate the structure of the pollinators' assemblage of Galvezia. Results Relationships of seven nucleotide-substitution haplotypes and 11 nucleotide-substitution ribotypes of Galvezia revealed monophyly for the Galapagos species. Dating estimates indicated divergence of the insular Galvezia lineage in the Middle-Upper Pleistocene (0.66-0.09Ma). In addition, distribution of genotypes (seven haplotypes, eight ribotypes) across the three continental species showed geographical differentiation, while low differentiation and distribution of G.leucantha. AFLP genetic diversity is relatively high (H-T=0.109), but a low proportion of the total allelic variance is attributed to variation among subspecies/islands (H-b=0.035, hierarchical AMOVA: 3.77% of total variance). The endemic bee (Xylocopa darwinii) accounted for 87.30% of the floral visits to G.leucantha.

There is growing proof that bees are regularly exposed to mixtures of agrochemicals, but most research has been focused on managed bees living in farmland, whereas little is known about exposure of wild bees, both in farmland and urban habitats. To determine exposure of wild bumblebees to pesticides in agricultural and urban environments through the season, specimens of five different species were collected from farms and ornamental urban gardens in three sampling periods. Five neonicotinoid insecticides, thirteen fungicides and a pesticide synergist were analysed in each of the specimens collected. In total, 61% of the 150 individuals tested had detectable levels of at least one of the compounds, with boscalid being the most frequently detected (35%), followed by tebuconazole (27%), spiroxamine (19%), carbendazim (11%), epoxiconazole (8%), imidacloprid (7%), metconazole (7%) and thiamethoxam (6%). Quantifiable concentrations ranged from 0.17 to 54.4 ng/g (bee body weight) for individual pesticides. From all the bees where pesticides were detected, the majority (71%) had more than one compound, with a maximum of seven pesticides detected in one specimen. Concentrations and detection frequencies were higher in bees collected from farmland compared to urban sites, and pesticide concentrations decreased through the season. Overall, our results show that wild bumblebees are exposed to multiple pesticides when foraging in agricultural and urban landscapes. Such mixtures are detected in bee tissues not just during the crop flowering period, but also later in the season. Therefore, contact with these combinations of active compounds might be more prolonged in time and widespread in the environment than previously assumed. These findings may help to direct future research and pesticide regulation strategies to promote the conservation of wild bee populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess bee-mediated pollen dispersal on a smaller scale, we conducted paternity analyses within a focal population, and quantified within-population spatial genetic structure in four populations. Gene flow was limited to certain nearby populations within continuous forest blocks, whereas drift appeared to dominate on larger scales. Limited long-distance gene flow was supported by within-population patterns; gene flow was biased towards nearby plants, and significant small-scale spatial genetic structure was detected within populations. These findings suggest that, although female euglossine bees might be effective at moving pollen within populations, and perhaps within forest blocks, their contribution to gene flow on the regional scale seems too limited to counteract genetic drift in patchily distributed tropical plants.

The total area of early flowering crops had a consistent negative impact on bumblebee density and species richness throughout the season, while late flowering crops had a positive impact in the beginning of the season before their bloom, suggesting a carry-over effect from previous years. The negative effects of early flowering crops could be due to competition of bumblebees with honey-bees, which are widely used in these crops. Bumblebee density and species richness were clearly negatively correlated with the total area of forest and flower-poor land use areas, including grass fields and cereals. In contrast, bumblebees were positively associated with most linear elements in the landscape (especially pasture and cropland verges), except for roads, which negatively affected bumblebee densities, possibly due to increased mortality, since the quality of the flower resources did not differ from other linear elements. Our results show that the quality and the spatial and temporal distribution of flower resources within the landscape are important drivers for bumblebees, but can create counterintuitive distribution patterns depending on the temporal and spatial resolution of the survey. Increasing flower resources in linear elements and the amount of late mass-flowering crops may be viable management measures to improve conditions for bumblebees in moderately intensified landscapes.

M.",,,Promoting diverse communities of wild bees and hoverflies requires a landscape approach to managing meadows,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"There is ongoing concern regarding the observed decline in pollinator populations. Managing agricultural landscapes through agri-environment schemes (AES) supports biodiversity and could counteract pollinator population declines. We investigated whether alterations to current AES grassland mowing regimes would increase the abundance and species richness of wild bees and hoverflies. Furthermore, we investigated the response of different nesting and feeding guilds of wild bees and hoverfiies, respectively, to these regimes. The three experimental mowing regimes were: (i) first cut not before 15 June, before the beginning of summer (Swiss AES management, control meadows); (ii) first cut delayed until 15 July (delayed meadows); (iii) as for control meadows but leaving 10-20% uncut as a refuge (refuge meadows). The rationale behind the delayed and refuge mowing regimes was extending the availability of floral resources for pollinators, while also providing refugia for species that may be directly impacted by mowing. Hoverflies and wild bees were collected in 2014 and 2015, respectively, using pan-trapping and sweep-netting, once before and once after the first cut. The two collecting methods showed contrasting results. While there was no difference in the abundance or richness of wild bees between the meadows when using pan traps, following the first cut, sweep-netting resulted in a higher abundance and richness of wild bees in delayed and refuge meadows compared to control meadows. Pan-trapping detected a higher abundance of hoverflies in delayed compared to refuge meadows, whereas sweep-netting detected a higher abundance in delayed and refuge compared to control meadows, after the first cut. Saprophagous hoverflies were more abundant in the control and delayed than refuge meadows following the first cut, when sampled with pan traps. Predatory hoverfiies were more abundant and species rich in delayed and refuge compared to control meadows following the first cut, when sampled by sweep netting. Our study demonstrates that simple alterations to a common AES grassland mowing regime can enhance populations of pollinators and natural enemies of crop pests. Furthermore, the contrasting response of the life-history guilds indicates that promoting heterogeneous management practices Within the landscape is important for supporting diverse communities, and maintaining key ecosystem services such as pollination and biocontrol.

Data collection on interactions between organisms and their environment has traditionally been conducted by on-site human observations, a time-consuming enterprise that could explain the shortage of around-the-clock observations of free-ranging wild animals. In this paper, I outline a time-efficient procedure to collect data on flower-visiting animals. The objectives were, first, to model diel activity rhythms by using cosine-based mixed-effects regression models (cosinor method) on data from an established automatic video monitoring system and, secondly, to test the use of a cheap off-the-shelf digital camera modified for automated monitoring of flower visitors. Two different model systems were studied: foraging bumblebees visiting focal white clovers, monitored around-the-clock (193h) to model diel activity; and honeybees visiting thistles, monitored over a shorter period (5h) to test the applicability and reliability of a new method for monitoring pollinators. The data were automatically entered and processed using R-scripts after manual filtering of the images, obviating the need for manual data entry prior to analysis. For diel activity in bumblebees, the model that gave the best fit included the 24-h fundamental period and one harmonic, a 12-h period to modulate the signal, together with temperature. The bumblebees were exclusive diurnal, with activity starting about 5h after sunrise, peaking sharply in the afternoon and ending about 1h before sunset. In addition to time of day, activity also increased with temperature. The off-the-shelf digital camera, Canon PowerShot((R)), with motion detection script, was triggered by every flower-visiting honeybee. In addition to recorded visitor frequency and visitor duration, it enabled high-resolution images, which could be important for species identification. Automatic camera recording is advantageous for close-up monitoring, compared with continuous video recording, because the latter demands more time and effort in reviewing the material. It could be used to study a range of different species such as pollinators, on-plant behaviour of herbivorous animals, cavity dwellers or cavity breeders. Moreover, the procedures for automatic data entry, data processing and statistical analysis for modelling diel activity rhythms could have great relevance for researchers using other types of camera monitoring systems operating 24h per day.",,,,"Steen, Ronny/Q-2740-2019; Steen, Ronny/D-4924-2015","Steen, Ronny/0000-0002-2465-8136; Steen, Ronny/0000-0002-2465-8136",,,,,,,,,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,,,FEB,2017,8,2,,,,,203,213,,10.1111/2041-210X.12654,,,,,,,WOS:000395092500007,,,,,

To study the role of such temporal cues for odorant detection and source localization, one needs odorant delivery devices that are capable of mimicking the temporal stimulus statistics of natural odor plumes.

Here, we present an olfactory stimulator that features precise control of high-bandwidth stimulus dynamics, which allows generating arbitrary fluctuating binary odorant mixtures. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the stimulator's performance and use it to demonstrate that odor background affects the temporal resolution of insect olfactory receptor neurons, and we present a hitherto unknown odor pulse- tracking capability of up to 60 Hz in Kenyon cells, which are higher order olfactory neurons of the insect brain. This stimulator might help investigating whether and how animals use temporal stimulus cues for odor detection and source localization.

Many spiders use conspicuous body colouration to lure prey, yet the perceptual basis of such deception remains largely unknown. Here we use knowledge of visual perception in key pollinator groups (bees and flies) to test whether colour-based lures resemble floral signals. We addressed this question at two levels: first according to the spectral reflectance of Australian orb-web spiders and flowers across a broad continental range, and second in reference to polymorphic variation in the species Gasteracantha fornicata. Analysis at the community level supported the hypotheses for broad-scale convergence among spider and flower signals. Moreover, data for G. fornicata indicate that each lure morph presents a signal biased towards the colouration of sympatric flowers. This analysis identified fly- and/or bee-pollinated plants whose flowers are likely to be indistinguishable from each G. fornicata colour morph. Our findings support the hypothesis that deceptive colour-based lures exploit prey preferences for floral resources.

Estimates of the typical distance from their nest that bees will fly to forage are useful when planning their deployment in commercial pollination or ecosystem management. Stingless bees (Meliponini) are social bees that live in colonies comprising a queen and many workers. They pollinate several key tropical crops and can be housed and transported in hives. Thus, there is increasing interest in their use as managed pollinators in regions where they occur naturally, including Australia. Here, we use a mark and release method to estimate the homing range of the most commonly propagated species of Australian stingless bee, Tetragonula carbonaria (Smith), where homing range serves as a proxy for foraging flight range.

But it has not been clear if observed benefits of floral enhancements result from greater population growth, which is critical for the long-term success of conservation, or from mobile foragers aggregating in high-resource locations. Experimental evidence is only beginning to emerge in favor of the former mechanism and it is not well-established how different aspects of floral resources affect population growth. For example, bumble bee colonies may benefit from greater overall floral abundance, richness, or relative dominance of resource species. Because bumble bees are highly mobile, resource variability in the surrounding landscape is also important for colonies and may mediate local-scale effects. We experimentally assessed the growth and reproduction of bumble bee colonies (Bombus impatiens) deployed in grasslands in different local-and landscape-scale resource environments. We found that floral dominance, rather than the overall abundance or richness of floral resources, was the most important local factor for colony growth and reproduction. This may reflect more efficient foraging on a few numerically dominant and abundant resource species. Local-and landscape-scale predictor variables had interacting effects On colony growth and reproduction, suggesting that foraging distance depends on where in the landscape efficiently used resources are located. Our results provide further evidence that conservation strategies aimed at enhancing floral resources can increase bumble bee population growth. However, the most effective forth of floral enhancement may vary among bee species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It has since spread very rapidly and has caused significant mortality among honeybees and native entomofauna. It also poses a risk to humans because its sting provokes allergic reactions. The objectives of this study were the following: (i) to disentangle the roles played by human-mediated dispersal and self-mediated dispersal in the species' rapid range expansion and (ii) to estimate the intensity of control measures in France and determine what needs to be done to slow the hornet's spread and dramatically reduce its population densities. A mathematical model was developed to describe the hornet's potential spread. This model included parameters describing the population growth rate, carrying capacity, self-mediated dispersal, human-mediated dispersal and the efficacy of control measures (i.e. the destruction of detected nests). Model parameters were estimated using 2004-2009 occurrence data for France and the model was then validated using 2013 occurrence data. Several scenarios were tested: human-mediated dispersal was present or absent and control intensity varied. Then, the species' spread in coming years was simulated (from 2013 to 2020). Despite some uncertainty on the value of the parameters, this model is relatively robust. Human-mediated dispersal may not be necessarily responsible for the hornet's rapid range expansion; the species could spread rapidly on its own. It is likely that to date, an average of 30-40% of detected nests have been destroyed each year. Increasing the percentage of destroyed nests from 30 to 60% could reduce the species' spread by 17% and its nest density by 29%. If 95% of nests are destroyed, the species' spread and nest density could decline by 43% and 53%, respectively.Synthesis and applications. The mathematical model developed in this study shows that human-mediated dispersal of the invasive yellow-legged hornet may not be the only factor explaining the hornet's rapid range expansion and that controlling this invasive pest is still possible. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reduce self-mediated dispersal and to intensify and improve control measures to diminish the species' impact and prevent its further spread. Control measures could combine the mechanical removal and destruction of individuals or infested materials with biological control techniques.",,,,,"Robinet, Christelle/0000-0002-4933-4656",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,FEB,2017,54,1,,,,,205,215,,10.1111/1365-2664.12724,,,,,,,WOS:000393322600022,,,,,

Concerns at these declines have led to the development of flower-rich agri-environment schemes as a way to enhance bee diversity and abundance. Whilst the effect of these schemes on bumblebee species (Bombus spp.) has been well studied, their impact on the wider bee community is poorly understood. We used direct observations of foraging bees and pollen load analysis to quantify the relative contribution that sown flowers (i.e. those included in agri-environment scheme seed mixes) make to the pollen diets of wild solitary bees on Higher Level Stewardship farms (HLS) implementing pollinator-focused schemes and on Entry Level Stewardship farms (ELS) without such schemes in southern England, UK. HLS management significantly increased floral abundance, and as the abundance of sown flowers increased, these sown plants were utilized for pollen by a greater proportion of the solitary bee species present. However, the overall proportion of pollen collected from sown plants was low for both direct observations (270%) and pollen load analysis (233%). At most only 25 of the 72 observed species of solitary bee (347%) were recorded utilizing sown plants to a meaningful degree. The majority of solitary bee species did not collect pollen from flower species sown for pollinators. Total bee species richness was significantly associated with plant species richness, but there was no difference in the total species richness of either bee or flowering plant species between HLS and ELS farms.Synthesis and applications. Our results show that the majority of solitary bee species present on farmland in the south-east of England collect most of their pollen from plants that persist unaided in the wider environment, and not from those included in agri-environment schemes focused on pollinators. If diverse bee communities are to be maintained on farmland, existing schemes should contain an increased number of flowering plant species and additional schemes that increase the diversity of flowering plants in complementary habitats should be studied and trialled.",,,,"Wood, Thomas/I-7025-2019; Goulson, David/A-2462-2010","Wood, Thomas/0000-0001-5653-224X; Goulson, David/0000-0003-4421-2876; holland, john/0000-0003-3742-7035",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,FEB,2017,54,1,,,,,323,333,,10.1111/1365-2664.12718,,,,,,,WOS:000393322600034,,,,,

It has been hypothesized that sun-basking behaviour may contribute to nest heating because of both heat carriage into the nest by sun-basking workers, and catabolic heat production from the mobilization of the workers' lipid reserves. We investigated sun-basking behaviour in laboratory colonies of F. polyctena exposed to an artificial heat source. Observations on identified individuals revealed that not all ants bask in the sun. Sun-basking and non-sun-basking workers did not differ in body size nor in respiration rates. The number of sun-basking ants and the number of their visits to the hot spot depended on the temperature of both the air and the hot spot. To investigate whether sun basking leads to a physiological activation linked with increased lipolysis, we measured respiration rates of individual workers as a function of temperature, and compared respiration rates of sun-basking workers before and two days after they were allowed to expose themselves to a heat source over 10 days, at self-determined intervals. As expected for ectothermic animals, respiration rates increased with increasing temperatures in the range 5 to 35 degrees C. However, the respiration rates of sun-basking workers measured two days after a long-term exposure to the heat source were similar to those before sun basking, providing no evidence for a sustained increase of the basal metabolic rates after prolonged sun basking. Based on our measurements, we argue that self-heating of the nest mound in early spring has therefore to rely on alternative heat sources, and speculate that physical transport of heat in the ant bodies may have a significant effect.",,,,"Kadochova, Stepanka/Q-5664-2017","Kadochova, Stepanka/0000-0003-1369-3929",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Jan-23,2017,12,1,,,,,,,e0170570,10.1371/journal.pone.0170570,,,,,,,WOS:000396129000071,28114396,,,,

This is in spite of the fact that the availability of natural habitat has been identified as a critical factor influencing the diversity and abundance of beneficial crop insects, including native pollinators. We examined the effect of the type of field edge habitat (forested or deforested) on the abundance and diversity of bee species foraging in 15 managed lowbush blueberry fields in the vicinity of St. Stephens, New Brunswick, Canada. Additionally, we tested whether edge habitat type was associated with differences in pollen limitation, fruit set, and seed set of adjacent lowbush blueberry plants. Finally, we used GIS to determine the influence of larger scale land use patterns on the pollinator community and crop success of individual fields. Our forested field edges were distinguished as having lower light availability, greater canopy cover, and a greater bee nesting habitat index than deforested edges. Forested edges also had a greater diversity of bees. In particular, they supported more species of cleptoparasitic bees than deforested edges. Meanwhile, the abundance of non-parasitic (i.e., pollen-seeking) bees was greater along deforested edges. Blueberry plants along deforested edges tended to have more flowers, higher fruit set and marginally higher seed set than plants along forested edges. We found no difference in pollen limitation between edge types, suggesting that differences in fruit set were due to resource limitation. At the landscape level, we found no association among the amount of forest cover surrounding a field and the abundance or diversity of pollinators. However, on the forested edges of fields, we did find a positive correlation between the amount of forest surrounding a field and the abundance of pollinators. Our finding that forested edges had greater nesting habitat index and higher diversity of bees together suggest that the maintenance of areas of natural habitat within agricultural ecosystems helps to support greater pollinator diversity.

We then examined the impacts of turbulence on bumblebee flight in a wind tunnel. Rolling instabilities increased in turbulence, but only at higher wind speeds. Bees displayed higher mean wingbeat frequency and stroke amplitude in these conditions, as well as increased asymmetry in stroke amplitude-suggesting that bees employ an array of active responses to enable flight in turbulence, which may increase the energetic cost of flight.

In two study regions in southwest France and southeast Australia, we used a RLQ analysis (three-table ordination method) to link bee traits with habitat amount and fragment isolation measured at the landscape scale. We found that bee ecological traits shifted at the community-level in association with landscape gradients, whereas species-level associations among bee traits and phylogenetic clustering in bee communities were of only minor importance in determining such shifts. We found that traits such as body size and nest location were closely linked to habitat amount and fragmentation. We also observed regionally-specific relationships among ecological traits, suggesting that the regional species pool can play an important role in determining the response of bee communities to habitat amount and fragmentation.

Studies completed on the macro-and micro-contents from dung deposited in a mountain cave in Catalonia during the 1970-1980s, preceding the socio-economic changes in the area, was supplemented by the testimony of the last shepherd alive in the area. This information was also compared with evidence from aerial photographs of the area surrounding the cave taken in 1956 and 2009. Although taphonomic distortion of the dung shape precluded its assignment to its producers based on morphology, information from the organic remains reflects the agro-pastoral activities in the mountainous area of the Catalan coast. A lack of calcium phosphate and abundant phytolith and epidermal remains from wild species indicates that the dung was excreted by ovicaprines, who sheltered in the cave during spells of adverse weather. These indicators also signify that the animals fed only on natural vegetation. Insect remains in the dung include fragments of chafers, dung and ground beetles, bees and ants, and whilst the latter may have foraged in the cave, the others may have been accidentally ingested by herbivores. The nannofossils and diatoms found in the dung derive from tertiary crops 4 km away from the cave but within the range of the ovicaprine herd. The lack of cereal and vegetable remains in the dung is consistent with the ethnographic record that shepherds and farmers could not afford to supplement the herds' diet with fodder crops or grain, a consequence of the low productivity of the local subsistence agriculture.

Introduced entomophilous non-native plants usually become well integrated into the diet of generalist pollinators. This integration can affect the entire recipient plant-pollinator network. Effects vary from facilitative to competitive, and understanding the factors that govern such variability is one of the fundamental goals in invasion ecology. Species traits determine the linking patterns between plant and pollinator species. Therefore, trait similarity among plants or among pollinators might modulate how they affect each other. 2. We conducted a flower removal experiment to investigate the effects of the non-native entomophilous legume Hedysarum coronarium on the pollination patterns of a Mediterranean shrubland plant-pollinator network. Specifically, we explored whether effects were influenced by similarity with the resident plant species in flower morphology (papilionate vs. non-papilionate), and whether effects on the pollinator community were influenced by similarity in functional group with its main visitor species (bees vs. non-bees). In addition, we explored whether Hedysarum had an effect on the identity of interactions. For this purpose, we calculated the interaction rewiring, that is the number of plant-pollinator interactions that were gained or lost after invasion. 3. Hedysarum was well integrated into the diet of 15 generalist pollinators having the honeybee as its main visitor species. Such integration did not affect visitation rates, normalized degree (i. e. proportion of pollinators they are visited by) nor niche overlap (i. e. proportion of plant species they share pollinators with) of plants, irrespective of their flower morphology. Only the proportion of honeybee visits to resident plants decreased with invasion. On the other hand, Hedysarum reduced visitation rates and niche overlap of pollinators, mainly those of bee species. Finally, we observed that changes in the foraging behaviour of the honeybee were positively associated with the interaction rewiring involving the rest (92 taxa) of pollinators. 4. In conclusion, pollinators show a plastic use of floral resources, responding to the presence of non-native plants. When the non-native attracts highly competitive pollinators such as the honeybee, plasticity is especially significant in pollinators that are functionally close to that competitive pollinator. The result is an interaction rewiring, probably due to pollinators avoiding competition with the honeybee. Though this plasticity might not quantitatively affect the pollination of plants, consequences on their reproduction and the functioning of the network can derive from the interaction rewiring.",,,,"Montero-Castano, Ana/M-8541-2015","Montero-Castano, Ana/0000-0003-2631-0085",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,JAN,2017,31,1,,,,,142,152,,10.1111/1365-2435.12712,,,,,,,WOS:000394372700016,,,,,

In this study we collected data on bees and wasps along two sides of a large road in Sweden using yellow pan traps. We then analyzed if the species composition differed between the two sides of the road; first for the whole community, and then only for the smallest species (which typically are poorer dispersers). As a complement, we analyzed if different vegetation variables differed between the two sides of the road, as this may also affect differences in species composition. Finally, we analyzed if species richness and abundance in general differed between the two sides and how these two response variables were explained by the vegetation variables. There was a significant difference in species composition between the eastern and the western side of the road when analyzing the whole community, and this relationship became even stronger when the largest species were excluded. The vegetation variables did not strongly differ between the two sides, and there was no difference in species richness and abundance of bees and wasps either. Abundance was, however, explained by the number of flowering plants in the surroundings of the trap. Even though using a rather limited data set, our results indicate that large roads may act as barriers on the movement of bees and wasps, especially for small species with poor dispersal ability.

The high genetic differentiation among populations of Encholirium horridum L.B.Sm. indicates low gene flow for this species that occurs exclusively on granitic inselbergs in South-east Brazil. Here we describe reproductive and pollination attributes of this bromeliad assessing how they influence the current degree of genetic isolation among populations. The mating system, estimated using five microsatellites markers, indicated allogamy and low pollen pool structure. The breeding system assessed by hand-pollination treatments supported partial self-incompatibility combined with inbreeding depression. Flowers of E. horridum are bell-shaped with crepuscular/nocturnal anthesis, and high nectar production, suggesting chiropterophily. Its pollination system was actually generalist but bats and hummingbirds were more frequent than hawkmoths and crepuscular bees. The high local abundance and large floral display per individual plant contributed to short distance pattern of pollen movement by pollinators. At the intra-population level, this pollinator foraging pattern, with inbreeding depression, promotes low seed viability and individual variations on outcrossing rate. At the inter-population level, those features led to low gene flow. Overall, heterozygosity, maintained by self-incompatibility and inbreeding depression, and pollination by vertebrates described here for E. horridum are consistent with other attributes that are predicted for inselberg plants by the OCBIL theory, such as reduced dispersability and genetic isolation among populations. Those characteristics contribute to the isolation of E. horridum populations and heighten the importance of population-based conservation strategies for taxa that occur exclusively in those naturally fragmented inselbergs.",,,,"Freitas, Leandro/E-6975-2011; Wolowski, Marina/H-1852-2013","Freitas, Leandro/0000-0002-4146-2514; Wolowski, Marina/0000-0001-5481-1472",,,,,,,,,,,,0067-1924,1444-9862,,,,,2017,65,4,,,,,315,326,,10.1071/BT16232,,,,,,,WOS:000406131200002,,,,,

The goals of this paper are to clarify the identity of these specimens, assess the species limits of E. coerulescens, and to evaluate suitability of habitats in the USA for this adventive species. Herein, we revise the species in the coerulescens group using morphological features of both sexes and confirm that the specimens of Eufriesea from the USA are E. coerulescens.

Travel route optimization or resource acquisition constraints usually lead to repeated sequences of visits, which may have major evolutionary and ecological implications. However, the study of this behavior has been impaired by a lack of concepts and methodologies. We here formally define routine movement behavior, provide an index that quantifies the degree of repetitiveness in movement sequences in terms of minimal conditional entropy, and design a flexible procedure that detects the specific subsequences that are repeated. We demonstrate our framework using computer simulations and real-world movement data of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus) introduced into a novel environment. The simulation example showed that our methods can suitably reveal the increase in the level of routine movement behavior during home range (HR) establishment. Black-tailed deer did not show such an increase, suggesting that HR establishment occurred very fast. In both examples, our procedure determining the subsequences that are repeated provides a precise visualization of routine movements. Our approach solves limitations in the study of routine movement behavior and thus opens promising perspectives for the study of the linkages between cognition, foraging strategies, and environments.

The diversity indices achieved through the short-term surveys were similar to or higher than those obtained from long-term studies. The low recapture rate of euglossine males seems to be the result of their long-distance dispersal capacity.

Once established, random fluctuations in birth and death rates may reduce the diversity of ecologically equivalent species if local populations are not replenished by immigrating individuals. Consequently, three key processes drive community assembly: dispersal limitation, ecological filtering, and ecological drift. However, disentangling the relative contribution of these processes remains a challenge in community ecology. We used a binomial generalized linear mixed model to test whether the occurrences of solitary bees within 46 communities in southeast Norway were driven by (1) dispersal limitation, that is, the geographic distance to the nearest site where conspecifics occurred; (2) ecological filtering, that is, if forb species richness selected for non-Ericaceae-affiliated species; and (3) ecological drift, that is, if small, isolated communities were dominated by regionally common species. The regression slopes from the model for each potential driver of community composition were compared with those expected under a null model, in which species were treated as ecologically equivalent. Both dispersal limitation and ecological filtering influenced the probability of species occurring within communities. The occurrence of species decreased with elevation, and this relationship depended on the relative commonness of species and their floral preferences. For non-Ericaceae-affiliated species, the patterns of occurrence mirrored that expected under the null (neutral) model, resulting in the same patterns as would be expected under ecological drift. In contrast, the response of Ericaceae-affiliated species differed from what would be expected from the null model. Our results also indicate that processes leading to neutral dynamics in species compositions drive a large part of the gradient in species richness in Norwegian bee communities. These processes seem related to sampling effects so that large and interconnected communities have a higher probability of including regionally rare species than small, isolated communities. Our results suggest that targeting habitats-where the influence of ecological filtering is expected to be greater than that of neutral dynamics-can increase the success of habitat management plans aimed at promoting rare species.",,,,"Potts, Simon G/C-7250-2008; Moe, Stein R./G-1507-2011","Potts, Simon G/0000-0002-2045-980X; Moe, Stein R./0000-0003-1005-3192; Sydenham, Markus Arne Kjaer/0000-0002-7711-2399",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,JAN,2017,8,1,,,,,,,e01650,10.1002/ecs2.1650,,,,,,,WOS:000396526300026,,,,,

For crops that are bee-pollinated, model predictions of outcrossing rates depend on the movement hypothesis used for the pollinators. Previous work studying pollen spread by honeybees, the most important pollinator worldwide, was based on the assumption that honeybee movement can be well approximated by Brownian motion. A number of recent studies, however, suggest that pollinating insects such as bees perform Levy flights in their search for food. Such flight patterns yield much larger rates of spread, and so the Brownian motion assumption might significantly underestimate the risk associated with GM pollen outcrossing in conventional crops. In this work, we propose a mechanistic model for pollen dispersal in which the bees performtruncated Levy flights. This assumption leads to a fractional- order diffusion model for pollen that can be tuned to model motion ranging from pure Brownian to pure Levy. We parametrize our new model by taking the same pollen dispersal dataset used in Brownian motion modelling studies.

Differences in dispersion capacity, which is greater in B. morio, likely influence their phylogeographic patterns. This study asks which processes best explain the patterns of genetic variation observed in B. morio and B. pauloensis, shedding light on the phenomena that shaped the range of local populations and the spatial distribution of intra-specific lineages. Results: Results suggest that Pleistocene climatic oscillations directly influenced the population structure of both species. Correlative species distribution models predict that the warmer conditions of the Last Interglacial contributed to population contraction, while demographic expansion happened during the Last Glacial Maximum. These results are consistent with physiological data suggesting that bumblebees are well adapted to colder conditions. Intra-specific mitochondrial genealogies are not congruent between the two species, which may be explained by their documented differences in dispersal ability. Conclusions: While populations of the high-dispersal B. morio are morphologically and genetically homogeneous across the species range, B. pauloensis encompasses multiple (three) mitochondrial lineages, and show clear genetic, geographic, and morphological differences. Because the lineages of B. pauloensis are currently exposed to distinct climatic conditions (and elevations), parapatric diversification may occur within this taxon.

This is thought to be particularly useful when a species of interest is spread out over a large area and sampling is constrained. We used occupancy modelling to estimate the probability of three phylogenetically independent pairs of native-introduced species [Megachile campanulae (Robertson)-Megachile rotundata (Fab.), Megachile pugnata Say-Megachile centuncularis (L.), Osmia pumila Cresson-Osmia caerulescens (L.)] (Apoidea: Megachilidae) being present when repeated sampling did not always find them. Our study occurred along a gradient of urbanization and used nest boxes (bee hotels) set up over three consecutive years. Occupancy modelling discovered different patterns to those obtained by species detection and abundance-based data alone. For example, it predicted that the species that was ranked 4th in terms of detection actually had the greatest occupancy among all six species. The native M. pugnata had decreased occupancy with increasing building footprint and a similar but not significant pattern was found for the native O. pumila. Two introduced bees (M. rotundata and M. centuncularis), and one native (M. campanulae) had modelled occupancy values that increased with increasing urbanization. Occupancy probability differed among urban green space types for three of six bee species, with values for two native species (M. campanulae and O. pumila) being highest in home gardens and that for the exotic O. caerulescens being highest in community gardens.

The proposed radar transmits two closely located frequencies to the transponder, and the transponder transmits a response signal at a mixed frequency. Because the frequency of the response signal is different from those of the clutter and leakage signals, the isolation is significantly improved. For a traditional harmonic radar, the leakage signals should be suppressed to a sensitivity lower than -106 dBm to avoid interference. The proposed radar requires only attenuation of leakage signals to a level lower than -8 dBm to avoid low-noise amplifier saturation. Harmonic radar transponders are compatible with the proposed radar system without additional design. This paper also proposes a new method for maintaining the correlation of transmitter and receiver phase noise. Field test results demonstrate that leakage signal interference in the proposed radar is far lower than that in the harmonic radar.

Thus, the fitness of pollinator populations significantly affects pollination services, because adult body size is determined by the resource availability at the larval stage.

Bee diet breadth has been associated with sensitivity to agricultural intensification, but much of this analysis has been conducted at the categorical level of generalist or specialist, and it is not clear to what extent the level of generalisation within generalist species is also associated with species persistence. We used pollen load analysis to quantify the pollen diets of wild solitary bees on 19 farms across southern England, UK. A total of 72 species of solitary bees were recorded, but only 31 species were abundant enough to allow for formal diet characterisation. The results broadly conformed to existing literature with the majority of species polylectic and collecting pollen from a wide range of plants. Pollen load analysis consistently identified pollens from more plant species and families from each bee species than direct observation of their foraging behaviour. After rarefaction to standardise pollen load sample sizes, diet breadth was significantly associated with frequency of occurrence, with more generalist bees present on more farms than less generalist bees. Our results show that the majority of bee species present on farmland in reasonable numbers are widely variable in their pollen choices, but that those with the broadest diet were present on the greatest number of farms.

To better understand potential effects of intercropping on bee communities, we investigated visitation of bees within three replicates of four treatments of loblolly pine in Mississippi, U.S.A.: 3-4 year old pine plantations and 9-10 year old pine plantations with and without intercropped switchgrass.

Although causes of the declines remain unclear, environmental factors may be responsible. We focused on the potential environmental determinants of local populations of wild honeybees, Apis cerana japonica, in Japan. This subspecies has little genetic variation in terms of its mitochondrial DNA sequences, and genetic variations at nuclear loci are as yet unknown. We estimated the genetic structure and environmental determinants of local genetic diversity in nuclear microsatellite genotypes of fathers and mothers, inferred from workers collected at 139 sites. The genotypes of fathers and mothers showed weak isolation by distance and negligible genetic structure. The local genetic diversity was high in central Japan, decreasing toward the peripheries, and depended on the climate and land use characteristics of the sites. The local genetic diversity decreased as the annual precipitation increased, and increased as the proportion of urban and paddy field areas increased. Positive effects of natural forest area, which have also been observed in terms of forager abundance in farms, were not detected with respect to the local genetic diversity.

We therefore developed a software tool, BEESCOUT, to theoretically examine how bees might explore a landscape and distribute their scouting activities over time and space. An image file can be imported, which is interpreted by the model as a ""forage map"" with certain colours representing certain crops or habitat types as specified by the user. BEESCOUT calculates the size and location of these potential food sources in that landscape relative to a bee colony. An individual-based model then determines the detection probabilities of the food patches by bees, based on parameter values gathered from the flight patterns of radar-tracked honeybees and bumblebees. Various ""search modes"" describe hypothetical search strategies for the long-range exploration of scouting bees. The resulting detection probabilities of forage patches can be used as input for the recently developed honeybee model BEEHAVE, to explore realistic scenarios of colony growth and death in response to different stressors. In example simulations, we find that detection probabilities for food sources close to the colony fit empirical data reasonably well. However, for food sources further away no empirical data are available to validate model output. The simulated detection probabilities depend largely on the bees' search mode, and whether they exchange information about food source locations. Nevertheless, we show that landscape structure and connectivity of food sources can have a strong impact on the results. We believe that BEESCOUT is a valuable tool to better understand how landscape configurations and searching behaviour of bees affect detection probabilities of food sources. It can also guide the collection of relevant data and the design of experiments to close knowledge gaps, and provides a useful extension to the BEEHAVE honeybee model, enabling future users to explore how landscape structure and food availability affect the foraging decisions and patch visitation rates of the bees and, in consequence, to predict colony development and survival.

Their nest contains food stores in the form of honey and pollen, as well as the brood, the queen and the bees themselves. These resources have to be defended against a wide range of predators and parasites, a task that is performed by specialized workers, called guard bees. Guards tune their response to both the nature of the threat and the environmental conditions, in order to achieve an efficient trade-off between defence and loss of foraging workforce. By releasing alarm pheromones, they are able to recruit other bees to help them handle large predators. These chemicals trigger both rapid and longer-term changes in the behaviour of nearby bees, thus priming them for defence. Here, we review our current understanding on how this sequence of events is performed and regulated depending on a variety of factors that are both extrinsic and intrinsic to the colony.

To counter parasitic threats, honey bees possess effective immune systems. Because immune responses are predicted to cause substantial physiological costs for infected individuals, they are expected to trade off with other life history traits that ultimately affect the performance and fitness of the entire colony. Here, we tested whether the initial onset of an infection negatively impacts the flight behaviour of honey bee workers, which is an energetically demanding behaviour and a key component of foraging activities. To do this, we infected workers with the widespread fungal pathogen Nosema apis, which is recognised and killed by the honey bee immune system. We compared their survival and flight behaviour with non-infected individuals from the same cohort and colony using radio frequency identification tags (RFID). We found that over a time frame of four days post infection, Nosema did not increase mortality but workers quickly altered their flight behaviour and performed more flights of shorter duration.

However, if conducted appropriately their contribution is most valuable. In this paper we identify the requirements of a large-scale monitoring study for the assessment of side-effects of clothianidin seed-treated winter oilseed rape on three species of pollinating insects (Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis) and present how these requirements were implemented. Two circular study sites were delineated next to each other in northeast Germany and comprised almost 65 km(2) each. At the reference site, study fields were drilled with clothianidin-free OSR seeds while at the test site the oilseed rape seeds contained a coating with 10 g clothianidin and 2 g beta-cyfluthrin per kg seeds (EladoA (R)).

Adding honeybees suppressed bumblebee densities in field borders and road verges in homogeneous landscapes whereas no such effect was detected in heterogeneous landscapes. The proportional abundance of bumblebee species with small foraging ranges was lower at honeybee sites than at control sites in heterogeneous landscapes, whereas bumblebee communities in homogeneous landscapes were dominated by a single species with long foraging range irrespective of if honeybees were added or not.

Despite the ecological and economic importance of wild bees and the fact that several species are now managed for pollination services worldwide, little is known about how land use and beekeeping practices jointly influence gene flow. Using stingless bees as a model system, containing wild and managed species that are presumed to be particularly susceptible to habitat degradation, here we examine the main drivers of tropical bee gene flow. We employ a novel landscape genetic approach to analyse data from 135 populations of 17 stingless bee species distributed across diverse tropical biomes within the Americas. Our work has important methodological implications, as we illustrate how a maximum-likelihood approach can be applied in a meta-analysis framework to account for multiple factors, and weight estimates by sample size. In contrast to previously held beliefs, gene flow was not related to body size or deforestation, and isolation by geographic distance (IBD) was significantly affected by management, with managed species exhibiting a weaker IBD than wild ones. Our study thus reveals the critical importance of beekeeping practices in shaping the patterns of genetic differentiation across bee species. Additionally, our results show that many stingless bee species maintain high gene flow across heterogeneous landscapes. We suggest that future efforts to preserve wild tropical bees should focus on regulating beekeeping practices to maintain natural gene flow and enhancing pollinator-friendly habitats, prioritizing species showing a limited dispersal ability.",,,,"Carvalheiro, Luisa/D-9414-2012; Acosta, Andre Luis/H-2036-2012; Alves, Denise Araujo/J-2047-2019; Francisco, Flavio O./J-6098-2012; Jaffe, Rodolfo/K-3230-2013; De la Rua, Pilar/A-4578-2009; Giannini, Tereza C/F-2676-2012; Giannini, Tereza/AAA-2958-2019; Imperatriz-Fonseca, Vera Lucia/H-5582-2012","Carvalheiro, Luisa/0000-0001-7655-979X; Acosta, Andre Luis/0000-0002-4244-9637; Alves, Denise Araujo/0000-0001-6525-427X; Francisco, Flavio O./0000-0002-0104-6575; Jaffe, Rodolfo/0000-0002-2101-5282; De la Rua, Pilar/0000-0002-0058-1402; Imperatriz-Fonseca, Vera Lucia/0000-0002-1079-2158; Arias, Maria Cristina/0000-0003-1477-101X; Giannini, Tereza/0000-0001-9830-1204",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,NOV,2016,25,21,,,,,5345,5358,,10.1111/mec.13852,,,,,,,WOS:000386353200007,27662098,,,,

Little is known about what exactly is learned when an animal seeks to become familiar with the environment. Navigating animals explore the environment for safe return to an important place (e.g., a nest site) and to travel between places [4]. Flying central-place foragers like honeybees (Apis mellifera) extend their exploration into distances from which the features of the nest cannot be directly perceived [5-10]. Bees perform short-range and long-range orientations flights. Short-range flights are performed in the immediate surroundings of the hive and occur more frequently under unfavorable weather conditions, whereas long-range flights lead the bees into different sectors of the surrounding environment [11]. Applying harmonic radar technology for flight tracking, we address the question of whether bees learn landscape features during their first short-range or long-range orientation flight. The homing flights of single bees were compared after they were displaced to areas explored or not explored during the orientation flight. Bees learn the landscape features during the first orientation flight since they returned faster and along straighter flights from explored areas as compared to unexplored areas. We excluded a range of possible factors that might have guided bees back to the hive based on egocentric navigation strategies (path integration, beacon orientation, and pattern matching of the skyline).

Predicting the drift pattern of this type of dust is challenging because the particles are very irregular in terms of size, shape, density, internal porosity and chemical composition. In this work, a 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of seed treatment dust drift was developed and validated with wind tunnel data. In the wind tunnel experiment, dust abraded from pesticide-treated seed was separated in three size fractions and released from a point source at a height of 0.7 m at three air velocities. Dust deposition was measured at six distances on the wind tunnel floor. The physicochemical properties of the dust samples were measured and implemented in the CFD model. Lagrangian tracking was used to calculate the dust particle trajectories. The simulated dust deposition patterns agreed with those observed in the wind tunnel trials. It was demonstrated that an accurate, particle size-dependent description of the shape, chemical content and internal porosity of the dust particles was necessary to achieve good validation results. The CFD model can be used as a basis for the simulation of dust drift in the field during sowing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Many foraging tasks rely on vision, e.g. spatial orientation and detection of food sources and nest entrances. Meliponini workers are usually small, which sets limits on eye morphology and thus quality of vision. Limitations are expected both on acuity, and thus on the ability to detect objects from a distance, as well as on sensitivity, and thus on the foraging time window at dusk and dawn. In this study, we determined light intensity thresholds for flight under dim light conditions in eight stingless bee species in relation to body size in a Neotropical lowland rainforest. Species varied in body size (0.8-1.7 mm thorax-width), and we found a strong negative correlation with light intensity thresholds (0.1-79 lx). Further, we measured eye size, ocelli diameter, ommatidia number, and facet diameter. All parameters significantly correlated with body size.

Nectar is a resource that exists along a continuum of quality in terms of sugar concentration and is the primary energy source for bees. Alternative sugar sources exist, including fruit juice, which generally has lower energetic value than nectar. We observed many honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata) foraging on juice from fallen guava (Psidium guajava) fruit near others foraging on nectar. To investigate whether fruit and nectar offered contrasting benefits of quality and quantity, we compared honeybee foraging performance on P. guajava fruit versus two wildflowers growing within 50 m, Richardia brasiliensis and Tridax procumbens. Bees gained weight significantly faster on fruit, 2.72 mg/min, than on either flower (0.17 and 0.12 mg/min, respectively). However, the crop sugar concentration of fruit foragers was significantly lower than for either flower (12.4% vs. 37.0% and 22.7%, respectively). Fruit foragers also spent the most time handling and the least time flying, suggesting that fruit juice was energetically inexpensive to collect. We interpret honeybee foraging decisions in the context of existing foraging models and consider how nest-patch distance may be a key factor for central place foragers choosing between resources of contrasting quality and quantity. We also discuss how dilute solutions, such as fruit juice, can help maintain colony sugar-water balance. These results show the benefits of feeding on resources with contrasting quality and quantity and that even low-quality resources have value.",,,,"Alves, Denise Araujo/J-2047-2019; Bento, Jose Mauricio Simoes/A-9759-2008","Alves, Denise Araujo/0000-0001-6525-427X; Bento, Jose Mauricio Simoes/0000-0001-8655-5178",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,OCT,2016,6,19,,,,,7156,7165,,10.1002/ece3.2478,,,,,,,WOS:000385626100034,28725389,,,,

Neither the presence nor the quantity of N. ceranae were at low, natural levels of infection had any effect on flight distance or duration, but presence of DWV reduced flight distance by two thirds and duration by one half. Quantity of DWV was shown to have a significant, but weakly positive relation with flight distance and duration, however, the low amount of variation that was accounted for suggests further investigation by dose-response assays is required.

Pesticide exposure may cause behavioural changes that interfere with these processes, with consequences for colony persistence and delivery of pollination services. 2. We investigated the impact of chronic exposure (5-43 days) to field-realistic levels of a neonicotinoid insecticide (2.4 pph thiamethoxam) on foraging ability, horning success and colony size using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in free-flying bumblebee colonies. 3. Individual foragers from pesticide-exposed colonies carried out longer foraging bouts than untreated controls (68 vs. 55 min). Pesticide-exposed bees also brought back pollen less frequently than controls indicating reduced foraging performance. 4. A higher proportion of bees from pesticide-exposed colonies returned when released 1 km from their nests; this is potentially related to increased orientation experience during longer foraging bouts. We measured no impact of pesticide exposure on homing ability for bees released from 2 km, or when data were analysed overall. 5. Despite a trend for control colonies to produce more new workers earlier, we found no overall impacts of pesticide exposure on whole colony size. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that field-realistic neonicotinoid exposure can have impacts on both foraging ability and homing success of bumblebees, with implications for the success of bumblebee colonies in agricultural landscapes and their ability to deliver crucial pollination services.

We examine here one of the largest bee genera, the genus Megachile - the dauber and leafcutting bees. Besides presenting a phylogeny based on five nuclear genes (5480 aligned nucleotide positions), we attempt to use the phylogenetic signal of mitochondria] DNA barcodes, which are rapidly accumulating and already include a substantial proportion of the known species diversity in the genus. We used barcodes in two ways: first, to identify particularly divergent lineages and thus to guide taxon sampling in our nuclear phylogeny; second, to augment taxon sampling by combining nuclear markers (as backbone for ancient divergences) with DNA barcodes. Our results indicate that DNA barcodes bear phylogenetic signal limited to very recent divergences (3-4 my before present). Sampling within clades of very closely related species may be augmented using this technique, but our results also suggest statistically supported, but incongruent placements of some taxa. However, the addition of one single nuclear gene (LW-rhodopsin) to the DNA barcode data was enough to recover meaningful placement with high Glade support values for nodes up to 15 million years old. We discuss different proposals for the generic classification of the tribe Megachilini. Finding a classification that is both in agreement with our phylogenetic hypotheses and practical in terms of diagnosability is particularly challenging as our analyses recover several well supported clades that include morphologically heterogeneous lineages. We favour a classification that recognizes seven morphologically well-delimited genera in Megachilini: Coelioxys, Gronoceras, Heriadopsis, Matangapis, Megachile, Noteriades and Radoszkowskiana. Our results also lead to the following classification changes: the groups known as Dinavis, Neglectella, Ewymeda and Phaenosarus are reestablished as valid subgenera of the genus Megachile, while the subgenus Alocanthedon is placed in synonymy with M. (Callomegachile), the subgenera Parachalicodoma and Largella with M. (Pseudomegachile), Anodonteutricharaea with M. (Paracella), Platysta with M. (Eurymella), and Grosapis and Eumegachile with M. (Megachile) (new synonymies).

Here, we investigate this by characterizing the performance of bumblebees, B. terrestris, landing on a flat platform at two different orientations (horizontal and vertical) and at four different light intensities (ranging from 600 lx down to 19 lx). As light intensity decreased, the bees modified their body position and the distance at which they extended their legs, suggesting that the control of landing in these insects is visually mediated. Nevertheless, the effect of light intensity was small and the landings were still well controlled, even in the dimmest light.

Using honeybees radar-tracked during their orientation flights in a novel landscape, we assess for the first time how two emerging infectious diseases (Nosema sp. and the Varroa-associated Deformed wing virus (DWV)) affect bees' behavioural performance and search strategy. Nosema infection, unlike DWV, affected the spatial scale of orientation flights, causing significantly shorter and more compact flights.

We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of these surprising insights, arguing that Levy search patterns are an emergent property of fundamental characteristics of neuronal and sensory components of the decision-making process, making them robust against diverse physiological effects of pathogen infection and possibly other stressors.",,,,"Lim, Ka Sing/B-4480-2012; Osborne, Juliet/I-6776-2012; Paxton, Robert/D-7082-2015","Lim, Ka Sing/0000-0002-9166-2928; Paxton, Robert/0000-0003-2517-1351",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,Sep-12,2016,6,,,,,,,,32612,10.1038/srep32612,,,,,,,WOS:000382887700001,27615605,,,,

There is compelling evidence that small species are more susceptible than large species. The impact of habitat fragmentation on intraspecific body-size distribution, however, is yet unexplored. Objectives We tested habitat fragmentation, a major driver of pollinator loss, for its impact on intraspecific body-size distributions of solitary wild-bee species. Subsequently, we tested individual body size for its impact on pollination services. Methods We sampled 1272 individuals of the four most common Andrena wild bee species in 22 newly established flowering fields (0.21-0.41 ha) in Hessen, Central Germany, over two consecutive years. Study sites were located in a ca. 80 ha landscape context of increasing habitat fragmentation. We analysed the pollen loads of the most abundant species. Results Body size within local populations of the two medium-sized bees increased with fragmentation, suggesting intraspecific selection for higher dispersal capacity. Pollen analysis carried out for the most common species revealed that larger individuals visited a significantly smaller plant spectrum. Habitat fragmentation may thus alter pollination services without necessarily affecting species richness or composition. Conclusions Systematic body-size variation at the population level thus explains the considerable variability between simple community measures and ecosystem functioning. Filtering processes at the individual level require increased understanding for targeting pollination services under current and future land-use change.",,,,"Warzecha, Daniela/I-4334-2019; Wolters, Volkmar/B-4635-2010; Jauker, Frank/I-5823-2017","Jauker, Frank/0000-0003-4137-9072",,,,,,,,,,,,0921-2973,1572-9761,,,,SEP,2016,31,7,,,,,1449,1455,,10.1007/s10980-016-0349-y,,,,,,,WOS:000382906500004,,,,,

However, knowledge of how the proteome controls MG development and functionality at the different physiological stages of worker bees is still lacking. We characterized and compared the proteome across different ages of MGs in Italian bees (ITBs) and Royal Jelly (RJ) bees (RJBs), the latter being a line bred for increasing RJ yield, originating from the ITB. All 2000 proteins that were shared by differently aged MGs in both bee lines (>4000 proteins identified in all) were strongly enriched in metabolizing protein, nucleic acid, small molecule, and lipid functional groups. The fact that these shared proteins are enriched in similar groups in both lines suggests that they are essential for basic cellular maintenance and MG functions. However, great differences were found when comparing the proteome across different MG phases in each line. In newly emerged bees (NEBs), the unique and highly abundant proteins were enriched in protein synthesis, cytoskeleton, and development related functional groups, suggesting their importance to initialize young MG development. In nurse bees (NBs), specific and highly abundant proteins were mainly enriched in substance transport and lipid synthesis, indicating their priority may be in priming high secretory activity in lipid synthesis as larval nutrition. The unique and highly abundant proteins in forager bees (FBs) were enriched in lipid metabolism, small molecule, and carbohydrate metabolism. This indicates their emphasis on 2-heptanone synthesis as an alarm pheromone to enhance colony defense or scent marker for foraging efficiency. Furthermore, a wide range of different biological processes was observed between ITBs and RJBs at different MG ages. Both bee stocks may adapt different proteome programs to drive gland development and functionality. The RJB nurse bee has reshaped its proteome by enhancing the rate of lipid synthesis and minimizing degradation to increase 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid synthesis, a major component of RJ, to maintain the desired proportion of lipids in increased RJ production. This study contributes a novel understanding of MG development and lipid metabolism, and a potential starting point for lipid or pheromone biochemists as well as developmental geneticists.",,,,"Li, Jianke/K-8139-2013; Han, Bin/P-3240-2017","Han, Bin/0000-0001-6974-8699",,,,,,,,,,,,1535-3893,1535-3907,,,,SEP,2016,15,9,,,,,3342,3357,,10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00526,,,,,,,WOS:000382713300037,27517116,,,,

However, it is unknown how increasing areas of mass-flowering crops like oilseed rape (Brassica napus; OSR) or a decrease of seminatural habitats (SNH) change the temporal and spatial availability of pollen resources for honey bee colonies, and thus foraging distances and frequency in different habitat types. We studied pollen foraging of honey bee colonies in 16 agricultural landscapes with independent gradients of OSR and SNH area within 2 km and used waggle dances and digital geographic maps with major land cover types to reveal the distance and visited habitat type on a landscape level. Mean pollen foraging distance of 1347 decoded bee dances was 1015 m (+/- 26 m; SEM). In spring, increasing area of flowering OSR within 2 km reduced mean pollen foraging distances from 1324 m to only 435 m. In summer, increasing cover of SNH areas close to the colonies (within 200 m radius) reduced mean pollen foraging distances from 846 to 469 m. Frequency of pollen foragers per habitat type, measured as the number of dances per hour and hectare, was equally high for SNH, grassland, and OSR fields, but lower for other crops and forests. In landscapes with a small proportion of SNH a significantly higher density of pollen foragers on SNH was observed, indicating that pollen resources in such simple agricultural landscapes are more limited. Overall, we conclude that SNH and mass-flowering crops can reduce foraging distances of honey bee colonies at different scales and seasons with possible benefits for the performance of honey bee colonies. Further, mixed agricultural landscapes with a high proportion of SNH reduce foraging densities of honey bees in SNH and thus possible competition for pollen resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,SEP,2016,26,6,,,,,1920,1929,,10.1890/15-1840.1,,,,,,,WOS:000383358000025,27755712,,,,

The proportion of impervious surfaces at the landscape scale had a negative effect on wild bee abundance and species richness, whereas local flower composition had no effect.

For this purpose, we developed a mechanistic, energetics-based model for a single day of nectar foraging in complex landscape mosaics. Net energetic efficiency determined resource patch choice. In one version of the model a single optimal patch was selected each hour. In another version, recruitment of foragers was simulated and several patches could be exploited simultaneously. Resource availability changed during the day due to depletion and/or intrinsic properties of the resource (anthesis). The model accounted for the impact of patch distance and size, resource depletion and replenishment, competition with other nectar foragers, and seasonal and diurnal patterns in availability of nectar-providing crops and wild flowers. From the model we derived simple rules for resource patch selection, e.g., for landscapes with mass-flowering crops only, net energetic efficiency would be proportional to the ratio of the energetic content of the nectar divided by distance to the hive. We also determined maximum distances at which resources like oilseed rape and clover were still energetically attractive. We used the model to assess the potential for pesticide exposure dilution in landscapes of different composition and complexity. Dilution means a lower concentration in nectar arriving at the hive compared to the concentration in nectar at a treated field and can result from foraging effort being diverted away from treated fields. Applying the model for all possible hive locations over a large area, distributions of dilution factors were obtained that were characterised by their 90-percentile value. For an area for which detailed spatial data on crops and off-field semi-natural habitats were available, we tested three landscape management scenarios that were expected to lead to exposure dilution: providing alternative resources than the target crop (oilseed rape) in the form of (i) other untreated crop fields, (ii) flower strips of different widths at field edges (off-crop in-field resources), and (iii) resources on off-field (semi-natural) habitats. For both model versions, significant dilution occurred only when alternative resource patches were equal or more attractive than oilseed rape, nearby and numerous and only in case of flower strips and off-field habitats. On an area-base, flower strips were more than one order of magnitude more effective than off-field habitats, the main reason being that flower strips had an optimal location. The two model versions differed in the predicted number of resource patches exploited over the day, but mainly in landscapes with numerous small resource patches. In landscapes consisting of few large resource patches (crop fields) both versions predicted the use of a small number of patches.",,,,"Focks, Andreas/O-1186-2015","Focks, Andreas/0000-0002-9031-0808",,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,Aug-16,2016,4,,,,,,,,e2293,10.7717/peerj.2293,,,,,,,WOS:000381344900004,27602273,,,,

Recent studies on bumblebees have showed how solitary foragers can learn traplines, minimising travel costs between multiple replenishing feeding locations. Here we demonstrate a similar routing strategy in the honeybee (Apis mellifera), a major pollinator known to recruit nestmates to discovered food resources. Individual honeybees trained to collect sucrose solution from four artificial flowers arranged within 10 m of the hive location developed repeatable visitation sequences both in the laboratory and in the field. A 10-fold increase of between-flower distances considerably intensified this routing behaviour, with bees establishing more stable and more efficient routes at larger spatial scales.

The available data are, however, geographically and taxonomically unrepresentative; most data are from North America and Western Europe, overrepresenting bumblebees and raising concerns that model results may not be generalizable to other regions and taxa. To assess whether the geographic and taxonomic biases of data could undermine effectiveness of models for conservation policy, we have collated from the published literature a global dataset of bee diversity at sites facing land-use change and intensification, and assess whether bee responses to these pressures vary across 11 regions (Western, Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe; North, Central and South America; Australia and New Zealand; South East Asia; Middle and Southern Africa) and between bumblebees and other bees. Our analyses highlight strong regionally-based responses of total abundance, species richness and Simpson's diversity to land use, caused by variation in the sensitivity of species and potentially in the nature of threats.

Decades of research have revealed that flying insects control speed, altitude, and trajectory by a simple strategy of maintaining or balancing the translational velocity of images on the eyes, known as pattern velocity. It has been proposed that birds may use a similar algorithm but this hypothesis has not been tested directly. We examined the influence of pattern velocity on avian flight by manipulating the motion of patterns on the walls of a tunnel traversed by Anna's hummingbirds. Contrary to prediction, we found that lateral course control is not based on regulating nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity. Instead, birds closely monitored feature height in the vertical axis, and steered away from taller features even in the absence of nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity cues. For vertical course control, we observed that birds adjusted their flight altitude in response to upward motion of the horizontal plane, which simulates vertical descent. Collectively, our results suggest that birds avoid collisions using visual cues in the vertical axis. Specifically, we propose that birds monitor the vertical extent of features in the lateral visual field to assess distances to the side, and vertical pattern velocity to avoid collisions with the ground. These distinct strategies may derive from greater need to avoid collisions in birds, compared with small insects.",,,,"Altshuler, Douglas L./E-5786-2011","Altshuler, Douglas L./0000-0002-1364-3617; Fellows, Tyee/0000-0003-2656-8537",,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,,,,,Aug-02,2016,113,31,,,,,8849,8854,,10.1073/pnas.1603221113,,,,,,,WOS:000380586600076,27432982,,,,

The conditions for presence/absence of pollinators are therefore complex and rely upon a combination of biotic and abiotic factors. To date there has been no easily available method for landowners to determine the potential of pollination delivery across the land effectively and rapidly. In this paper we develop a method that uses freely available datasets to remotely estimate the relative provision of pollination service delivery provided by bees across Europe at a 300 m-pixel resolution.

A common goal is to detect range shifts in response to climate change, including changes in the centre of the population's distribution (the centre of gravity, COG), population boundaries and area occupied. Conventional estimators, such as the abundance-weighted average (AWA) estimator for COG, confound range shifts with changes in the spatial distribution of available survey data and may be biased when the distribution of survey data shifts over time. AWA also does not estimate the standard error of COG in individual years and cannot incorporate data from multiple survey designs. To explicitly account for changes in the spatial distribution of survey effort, we propose an alternative species distribution function (SDF) estimator. The SDF approach involves calculating distribution metrics, including COG, population boundary and area occupied, directly from the predicted species distribution or density function. We illustrate the SDF approach using a spatiotemporal model that is available as an r package. Using simulated data, we confirm that the SDF substantially decreases bias in COG estimates relative to the AWA estimator. We then illustrate the method by analysing data from two data sets spanning 1977-2013 for 18 marine fishes along the U.S. West Coast. In our case study, the SDF estimator shows significant northward shifts for six of 18 species (with southward shifts for only 2), where two species (darkblotched and greenstriped rockfishes) have both a northward shift and a decreased area occupied. Pelagic species (e.g. Pacific hake and spiny dogfish) have more variable distribution than bottom-associated species. We also find substantial differences between AWA and SDF estimates of COG that are likely caused by shifts in sampling distribution (which affect the AWA but not the SDF estimator). We caution that common estimators for range shift can yield inappropriate inference whenever sampling designs have shifted over time. We conclude by suggesting further improvements in model-based approaches to analysing climate impacts, including methods addressing the impact of local and regional temperature changes on species distribution.",,,,"Thorson, James T/O-7937-2014; Pinsky, Malin L./K-2884-2015; Thorson, James T/H-8771-2019","Thorson, James T/0000-0001-7415-1010; Pinsky, Malin L./0000-0002-8523-8952; Thorson, James T/0000-0001-7415-1010",,,,,,,,,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,,,AUG,2016,7,8,,,,,990,1002,,10.1111/2041-210X.12567,,,,,,,WOS:000382505900013,,,,,

Virus infection induces changes in plant volatile emission profiles, and this can make plants more attractive to insect herbivores, such as aphids, that act as viral vectors. However, it is unknown if virus-induced alterations in volatile production affect plant-pollinator interactions. We found that volatiles emitted by cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-infected tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and Arabidopsis thaliana plants altered the foraging behaviour of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Virus-induced quantitative and qualitative changes in blends of volatile organic compounds emitted by tomato plants were identified by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. Experiments with a CMV mutant unable to express the 2b RNA silencing suppressor protein and with Arabidopsis silencing mutants implicate microRNAs in regulating emission of pollinator-perceivable volatiles. In tomato, CMV infection made plants emit volatiles attractive to bumblebees. Bumblebees pollinate tomato by 'buzzing' (sonicating) the flowers, which releases pollen and enhances self-fertilization and seed production as well as pollen export. Without buzz-pollination, CMV infection decreased seed yield, but when flowers of mock-inoculated and CMV-infected plants were buzz-pollinated, the increased seed yield for CMV-infected plants was similar to that for mock-inoculated plants. Increased pollinator preference can potentially increase plant reproductive success in two ways: i) as female parents, by increasing the probability that ovules are fertilized; ii) as male parents, by increasing pollen export. Mathematical modeling suggested that over a wide range of conditions in the wild, these increases to the number of offspring of infected susceptible plants resulting from increased pollinator preference could outweigh underlying strong selection pressures favoring pathogen resistance, allowing genes for disease susceptibility to persist in plant populations. We speculate that enhanced pollinator service for infected individuals in wild plant populations might provide mutual benefits to the virus and its susceptible hosts.",,,,"Bruce, Toby JA/H-3131-2011; Carr, John/H-5646-2016; Carr, John Peter/N-7707-2019; Furzer, Oliver/Q-8581-2019; Groen, Simon/G-2443-2012","Bruce, Toby JA/0000-0002-9912-0605; Carr, John/0000-0002-5028-2160; Carr, John Peter/0000-0002-5028-2160; Cunniffe, Nik/0000-0002-3533-8672; Furzer, Oliver/0000-0002-3536-9970; Murphy, Alex/0000-0002-2226-8759; Davis, Christopher/0000-0003-2665-0127",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7366,1553-7374,,,,AUG,2016,12,8,,,,,,,e1005790,10.1371/journal.ppat.1005790,,,,,,,WOS:000383376000028,27513727,,,,
J,"Dorado, J; Vazquez, DP",,,,"Dorado, Jimena; Vazquez, Diego P.",,,Flower diversity and bee reproduction in an arid ecosystem,PEERJ,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: Diverse flower communities are more stable in floral resource production along the flowering season, but the question about how the diversity and stability of resources affect pollinator reproduction remains open. High plant diversity could favor short foraging trips, which in turn would enhance bee fitness. In addition to plant diversity, greater temporal stability of floral resources in diverse communities could favor pollinator fitness because such communities are likely to occupy the phenological space more broadly, increasing floral availability for pollinators throughout the season. In addition, this potential effect of flower diversity on bee reproduction could be stronger for generalist pollinators because they can use a broader floral spectrum. Based on above arguments we predicted that pollinator reproduction would be positively correlated to flower diversity, and to temporal stability in flower production, and that this relationship would be stronger for the most generalized pollinator species. Materials and Methods: Using structural equation models, we evaluated the effect of these variables and other ecological factors on three estimates of bee reproduction (average number of brood cells per nest per site, total number of brood cells per site, and total number of nests per site), and whether such effects were modulated by bee generalization on floral resources. Results: Contrary to our expectations, flower diversity had no effect on bee reproduction, stability in flower production had a weakly negative effect on one of the bee reproductive variables, and the strength of the fitness-diversity relationship was unrelated to bee generalization. In contrast, elevation had a negative effect on bee reproduction, despite the narrow elevation range encompassed by our sites. Discussion: Flower diversity did not affect the reproduction of the solitary bees studied here. This result could stem from the context dependence of the diversity-stability relationship, given that elevation had a positive effect on flower diversity but a negative effect on bee reproduction. Although high temporal stability in flower production is expected to enhance pollinator reproduction, in our study it had a weakly negative-instead of positive-effect on the average number of brood cells per nest. Other environmental factors that vary with elevation could influence bee reproduction. Our study focused on a small group of closely-related bee species, which cautions against generalization of our findings to other groups of pollinators. More studies are clearly needed to assess the extent to which pollinator demography is influenced by the diversity of floral resources.",,,,,"Vazquez, Diego P./0000-0002-3449-5748",,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,Jul-26,2016,4,,,,,,,,e2250,10.7717/peerj.2250,,,,,,,WOS:000380154300005,27547556,,,,

Pollen is the primary source of proteins and lipids for bees, and the concentrations of these nutrients in pollen can vary widely among host-plant species. Therefore we hypothesized that foraging decisions of bumble bees are driven by both the protein and lipid content of pollen. By successively reducing environmental and floral cues, we analyzed pollen-foraging preferences of Bombus impatiens in (i) host-plant species, (ii) pollen isolated from these host-plant species, and (iii) nutritionally modified single-source pollen diets encompassing a range of protein and lipid concentrations. In our semifield experiments, B. impatiens foragers exponentially increased their foraging rates of pollen from plant species with high protein: lipid (P:L) ratios; the most preferred plant species had the highest ratio (similar to 4.6:1). These preferences were confirmed in cage studies where, in pairwise comparisons in the absence of other floral cues, B. impatiens workers still preferred pollen with higher P: L ratios. Finally, when presented with nutritionally modified pollen, workers were most attracted to pollen with P: L ratios of 5: 1 and 10: 1, but increasing the protein or lipid concentration (while leaving ratios intact) reduced attraction. Thus, macronutritional ratios appear to be a primary factor driving bee pollen-foraging behavior and may explain observed patterns of host-plant visitation across the landscape. The nutritional quality of pollen resources should be taken into consideration when designing conservation habitats supporting bee populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,,,,,Jul-12,2016,113,28,,,,,E4035,E4042,,10.1073/pnas.1606101113,,,,,,,WOS:000379694100009,27357683,,,,

Several studies have examined the impact of forest proximity on plant pollination ecology, but concentrated on single crop species. However, it can be more informative to investigate multiple crop and pollinator species in a community, because different pollinator groups may respond differently to forest distance. We evaluated flower visitor diversity, visitation frequency, and fruit set for three crop species (rambutan, durian and mango) in 10 pairs of mixed fruit orchards. Each pair consisted of one orchard near to (< 1 km) and one orchard far from (> 7 km) the forest edge. Rambutan fruit set was significantly influenced by distance to forest. The main visitors of rambutan flowers were stingless bees. In contrast, the dominant visitors to durian and mango flowers were nectarivorous bats and flies, respectively, and the fruit set of these crops were not significantly influenced by distance to forest. However, durian fruit set was negatively affected by distance to the nearest cave inhabited by nectarivorous bats. This study demonstrates that both caves and forests can be important pollinator sources for agricultural crops, and that the dispersal success of pollinators is related to isolation from source habitats. Maintaining forest patches and limestone karsts may provide stepping stones across fragmented landscapes, and attract greater numbers of pollinators to agricultural areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0266-4674,1469-7831,,,,JUL,2016,32,,4,,,,269,279,,10.1017/S0266467416000353,,,,,,,WOS:000379973500001,,,,,

The knowledge of relatedness among the males attending the aggregations and the distance that they disperse from their natal nests to aggregations may provide important data to effectively conserve these bees. Here, we estimated these properties for Tetragonisca angustula (Latreille, 1811) males. Microsatellite molecular markers were used to genotype bees sampled from local nests and in mating swarms in order to identify the nests of origin of males and maternal genotypes of concerning queens. The distances from assigned nests to the mating swarms allowed us to estimate the distances travelled by males. A genetic relationship analysis was conducted to verify whether T.angustula males were closely related to nests where they aggregated. A pairwise relatedness analysis was also performed among all T.angustula males in each mating swarm. Our results demonstrated that T.angustula mating swarms received dozens to hundreds of males from several colonies (up to 70). Only two of the five mating swarms contained any males that were closely related to the bees from the new nests in construction. The relatedness among males was also extremely low. Yet, dispersal distance of T.angustula males ranged hundreds of meters up to 1.6km, with evidence of reaching 2.25km according to their flight radius obtained from their foraging area for locality.

The temporal polyethism schedule is sensitive to colony perturbations that may lead to adaptive changes in task allocation, maintaining colony homeostasis. Though social insects can be infected by a range of parasites, little is known of how these parasites impact within-colony behaviour and the temporal polyethism schedule. We use honey bees (Apis mellifera) experimentally infected by two of their emerging pathogens, Deformed wing virus (DWV), which is relatively understudied concerning its behavioural impact on its host, and the exotic microsporidian Nosema ceranae. We examined parasite effects on host temporal polyethism and patterns of activity within the colony. We found that pathogens accelerated the temporal polyethism schedule, but without reducing host behavioural repertoire. Infected hosts exhibited increased hyperactivity, allocating more time to self-grooming and foraging-related tasks. The strength of behavioural alterations we observed was found to be pathogen specific; behavioural modifications were more pronounced in virus-treated hosts versus N. ceranae-treated hosts, with potential benefits for the colony in terms of reducing within-colony transmission.

Consequences may range from reproductive competition to facilitation, but the ecological drivers determining the type and magnitude of such indirect interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the role of the spatial scale of invader presence and spatially contingent behavioural responses of different pollinator groups as potential key drivers, using the invasive Oxalis pes-caprae and the self-incompatible native annual Diplotaxis erucoides as a model system. Three treatments were assigned to native focal plants: (1) invader present at the landscape scale (hectares) but experimentally removed at the floral neighbourhood scale (pa); (2) invader present at both scales (pp); (3) invader absent at both scales (aa). Interestingly, we found pronounced spatially contingent differences in the responses of pollinators: honeybees and bumblebees were strongly attracted into invaded sites at the landscape scale, translating into native plant visitation facilitation through honeybees, while bumblebees almost exclusively visited Oxalis. Non-corbiculate wild bees, in contrast, showed less pronounced responses in foraging behavior, primarily at the floral neighborhood scale. Average heterospecific (Oxalis) pollen deposition onto stigmas of Diplotaxis was low (<1 %), but higher in the pp than in the pa treatment. Hand-pollination of Diplotaxis with Oxalis and conspecific pollen, however, reduced seed set by more than half when compared to hand-pollination with only conspecific pollen. Seed set of Diplotaxis, finally, was increased by 14 % (reproductive facilitation) in the pp treatment, while it was reduced by 27 % (reproductive competition) in the pa treatment compared to uninvaded populations.

Thermal tolerance of diverse organisms often varies predictably with latitude, with upper thermal limits changing little and lower thermal limits decreasing with latitude. Despite similarly steep gradients in environmental temperatures across altitude, few studies have investigated altitudinal variation in critical thermal limits. We estimated critical thermal minimum (CTmin), critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and recovery temperature (T-rec) by tracking righting response of three bumble bee species during thermal ramps: Bombus huntii collected from 2180 m asl, and Bombus bifarius and Bombus sylvicola collected from 3290 m asl in Wyoming, USA. Overall, larger bees could tolerate more extreme temperatures, likely due to a thermal inertia driven lag between core body temperatures and air temperatures. Despite their smaller size, high altitude bumble bees tolerated colder air temperatures: they had similar to 1 degrees C lower Crmin and recovered from cold exposure at similar to 3-4 degrees C lower air temperatures. Conversely, low altitude bees tolerated similar to 5 degrees C hotter air temperatures. These altitudinal differences in thermal tolerance parallel differences in average daily minimum (1.2 degrees C) and maximum (7.5 degrees C) temperatures between these sites.

Since so far the evidence for monocausal explanations is equivocal, involvement of multiple stressors is generally assumed. We here focus on various aspects of forage availability, which have received less attention than other stressors because it is virtually impossible to explore them empirically. We applied the colony model BEEHAVE, which links within-hive dynamics and foraging, to stylized landscape settings to explore how foraging distance, forage supply, and ""forage gaps"", i.e. periods in which honeybees cannot find any nectar and pollen, affect colony resilience and the mechanisms behind. We found that colony extinction was mainly driven by foraging distance, but the timing of forage gaps had strongest effects on time to extinction. Sensitivity to forage gaps of 15 days was highest in June or July even if otherwise forage availability was sufficient to survive. Forage availability affected colonies via cascading effects on queen's egg-laying rate, reduction of new-emerging brood stages developing into adult workers, pollen debt, lack of workforce for nursing, and reduced foraging activity. Forage gaps in July led to reduction in egg-laying and increased mortality of brood stages at a time when the queen's seasonal egg-laying rate is at its maximum, leading to colony failure over time. Our results demonstrate that badly timed forage gaps interacting with poor overall forage supply reduce honeybee colony resilience. Existing regulation mechanisms which in principle enable colonies to cope with varying forage supply in a given landscape and year, such as a reduction in egg-laying, have only a certain capacity. Our results are hypothetical, as they are obtained from simplified landscape settings, but they are consistent with existing empirical knowledge.

Approaches combining reproductive biology and fine-scale spatial genetic structure analyses using ten microsatellite markers in 49 individuals sampled in the only remaining large population of V. humblotii were employed to unravel the reproductive strategies of this species. The results showed that V. humblotii displays unscented flowers and is allogamous and pollinator-dependent although also self-compatible.

A high genotypic diversity (G/N = 0.88) and a phalanx clonal growth are detected, and seed dispersal is higher than pollen dispersal. The phalanx distribution of the repeated genotypes (ramets arisen from the same genet) is responsible for significant autocorrelations detected at small distances. Limited inbreeding was detected although geitonogamy could have been enhanced by vegetative reproduction. This study highlights the need to perform interdisciplinary studies to unravel the reproductive strategy of clonal plant species with a deceptive pollination system. (C) 2016 SAAB.

The age of an insect strongly influences many aspects of behavior and reproduction. The interaction of age and behavior is epitomized in the temporal polyethism of honey bees in which young adult bees perform nurse and maintenance duties within the colony, while older bees forage for nectar and pollen. Task transition is dynamic and driven by colony needs. However, an abundance of precocious foragers or overage nurses may have detrimental effects on the colony. Additionally, honey bee age affects insecticide sensitivity. Therefore, determining the age of a set of individual honey bees would be an important measurement of colony health. Pteridines are purine-based pigment molecules found in many insect body parts. Pteridine levels correlate well with age, an wild caught insects maybe accurate age by measuring pteridine levels. The relationship between pteridines and age varies with a number of internal and external factors among many species. Thus far, no studies have investigated the relationship of.. pteridines with age in honey bees. Methods. We established single-cohort colonies to obtain age-matched nurse and forager bees. Bees of known ages were also sampled from colonies with normal demographics. Nurses and foragers were collected every 3-5 days for up to 42 days. Heads were removed and weighed before pteridines were purified and analyzed using previously established fluorometric methods. Results. Our analysis showed that pteridine levels significantly increased with age in a linear manner in both single cohort colonies and colonies with normal demography. Pteridine levels were higher in foragers than nurses of the same age in bees from single cohort colonies. Head weight significantly increased with age until approximately 28-days of age and then declined for both nurse and forager bees in single cohort colonies. A similar pattern of head weight in bees from colonies with normal demography was observed but head weight was highest in 8-day old nurse bees and there was no relationship of head weight with age of foragers. Discussion. Although the relationship between pteridine levels and age was significant, variation in the data yielded a +4-day range in age estimation, This allows an unambiguous method to determine whether a bee may be a young nurse or old forager in colonies with altered demographics as in the case of single cohort colonies. Pteridine levels in bees do not correlate with age as well as in other insects. However, most studies used insects reared under tightly controlled laboratory conditions, while we used free-living bees, The dynamics of head weight change with age is likely to be due to growth and atrophy of the hypopharyngeal glands. Taken together, these methods represent a useful tool for assessing the age of an insect. Future studies utilizing these methods will provide a more holistic view of colony health.",,,,,"Healy, Kristen/0000-0002-3208-6537",,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,Jun-30,2016,4,,,,,,,,e2155,10.7717/peerj.2155,,,,,,,WOS:000378797400003,27413635,,,,

By attaching altitude loggers to nesting Purple Martins and collecting prey delivered to their nestlings, we determined the flight altitudes of ants and other insects. We then tested hypotheses relating ant body size and reproductive ecology to flight altitude. Purple Martins flew up to 1,889 meters above ground, and nestling provisioning trips ranged up to 922 meters. Insect communities were structured by body size such that species of all sizes flew near the ground but only light insects flew to the highest altitudes. Ant maximum flight altitudes decreased by 60% from the lightest to the heaviest species. Winged sexuals of social insects (ants, honey bees, and termites) dominated the Purple Martin diet, making up 88% of prey individuals and 45% of prey biomass. By transferring energy from terrestrial to aerial food webs, mating swarms of social insects play a substantial role in aerial ecosystems.

Although entomologists have used direct observation and mark-and-recapture techniques as tracking methods, there are drawbacks such as low recapture rates in the case of marking techniques. The objective of this study was to quantitatively examine adhesive bond strength between radar tag and insect body and to evaluate the effect of tag attachment on flight behavior and capacity of five economically important insect species, including three pest species, Riptortus pedestris (Hemiptera: Alydidae), Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae), and Ricania sp. (Hemiptera: Ricaniidae) and two pollinators, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae). The adhesive bond strength was substantially different among these five insect species, but the strength was sufficiently strong for operational use in harmonic radar tagging except in Ricania sp. Bond strength on B. terrestris was 817 +/- 43.65 g-forces, which was the strongest among the five species tested, while that on Ricania sp. was 1.7 +/- 0.20 g-forces, which was the weakest. For all insects, no significant correlation between bond strength and insect body size was observed. The radar tag attachment affected the flight behavior and capacity of five insect species in different ways. The radar tag attachment did not significantly affect the propensity of R. pedestris, L. delicatula, or B. terrestris to takeoff compared to untagged individuals. However, the takeoff propensities of A. mellifera and Ricania sp. were negatively affected by the radar tag attachment. Flight capacities of R. pedestris, A. mellifera, and B. terrestris were not affected by the tag attachment compared to untagged individuals, but the flight capacity of Ricania sp. was negatively affected by the tag attachment. The results of this study indicate that the radar technique has promising potential for R. pedestris, L delicatula, and B. terrestris. However, this technique may have limited potential for A. mellifera and Ricania sp. because the radar tag can significantly affect their flight behavior.

We investigated whether local and landscape characteristics are important correlates of bee (Hymenoptera: Apiformes) abundance and species richness in urban community gardens. We worked in 19 gardens in the California central coast and sampled bees with aerial nets and pan traps. We measured local characteristics (i.e., vegetation and ground cover) and used the USGS National Land Cover Database to classify the landscape surrounding our garden study sites at 2 km scales. We classified bees according to nesting type (i.e., cavity, ground) and body size and determined which local and landscape characteristics correlate with bee community characteristics. We found 55 bee species. One landscape and several local factors correlated with differences in bee abundance and richness for all bees, cavity-nesting bees, ground-nesting bees, and different sized bees. Generally, bees were more abundant and species rich in bigger gardens, in gardens with higher floral abundance, less mulch cover, more bare ground, and with more grass. Medium bees were less abundant in sites surrounded by more medium intensity developed land within 2 km. The fact that local factors were generally more important drivers of bee abundance and richness indicates a potential for gardeners to promote bee conservation by altering local management practices. In particular, increasing floral abundance, decreasing use of mulch, and providing bare ground may promote bees in urban gardens.",,,,"Philpott, Stacy/M-3486-2019; Philpott, Stacy M/F-2330-2011","Philpott, Stacy/0000-0002-8338-3806; Philpott, Stacy M/0000-0002-8338-3806",,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,1938-2936,,,,JUN,2016,45,3,,,,,592,601,,10.1093/ee/nvw025,,,,,,,WOS:000381910800007,27034445,,,,

Habitat fragmentation can limit connectivity between populations and gene flow between bumblebee populations can be limited by open water and human altered landscapes, however the influence of landscape features on gene flow has only been examined in non-declining species. The ruderal bumblebee, Bombus ruderatus, was successfully introduced to and is now relatively common in New Zealand, providing an opportunity to examine the biology of a species that is now rare in its native range in the UK. In this study, we examine the genetic structuring of B. ruderatus populations in the South Island of New Zealand and we demonstrate that a relatively simple classification of the landscape, into either good or poor foraging habitat at coarse resolution (800 m(2)), can predict levels of gene flow. We found populations of B. ruderatus as far apart as 160 km showing no significant genetic differentiation. However, this level of gene flow appears to be reliant upon continuous suitable habitat, as other populations < 100 km apart were found to be significantly differentiated. These results suggest that corridors of continuous habitat are required to facilitate gene flow over large distances for this species.",,,,"Bartlett, Michael/AAH-2944-2019","Bartlett, Michael/0000-0002-4253-6589",,,,,,,,,,,,1566-0621,1572-9737,,,,JUN,2016,17,3,,,,,703,713,,10.1007/s10592-016-0816-7,,,,,,,WOS:000376087200016,,,,,

In the context of global environmental change, specific dispersal strategies have to be understood and foreseen if we like to prevent general biodiversity impoverishment or the spread of allochthonous diseases. We explored the genetic structure and potential population mixing on the recently range expanding European bee-eater Merops apiaster. In addition, the species is suspected of harbouring and disseminating the most relevant disease for bees and apiculture, Nosema microsporidia. In agreement with complementary ringing recovery data and morphometric measurements, genetic results on two mitochondrial genes and 12 microsatellites showed a reasonably well-structured population partitioning along its breeding distribution. Microsatellite results indicated that not only did a few birds recently disperse long distance during their return migrations and change their natal breeding areas, but also that a group of allochthonous birds together founded a new colony. Although we did not provide evidence on the direct implication of birds in the widespread of Nosema parasites, our finding on the long-distance dispersal of bird flocks between remote breeding colonies adds concern about the role of European bee-eaters in the spread of such disease at a large, inter-continental scale.

Ground nesting bees were positively associated with recently-burnt sites, which provide bare soil and therefore nesting sites for this group of bees. Polylectic bees were positively associated with twice-burnt sites, indicating the dominance of generalist bee species.

Fire can affect bees directly through exposure to heat and smoke. Direct effects include mortality, injury, and displacement affecting at most two generations adults and any immature progeny present during the fire. To study the direct effects of fire on bees, two criteria must be met. First, bees must be sampled soon after the fire event, before colonists arrive from outside the burn. Second, sampling locations must be far enough into the burned habitat to ensure that bees observed are survivors, and not foragers nesting outside the burn. 2. Bees were systematically sampled far inside (>7 km) and outside the burn perimeter immediately following a massive wildfire that burned primarily at night in sagebrush steppe habitat. Because adult females sleep in their nests, it was hypothesised that females of species with nests >10 cm underground would be safe from lethal heat. Whereas females with shallow or above-ground nests would be vulnerable. It was also hypothesised that fire would kill proportionately more males, as they typically sleep above ground. 3. Adult bees were present at all burned sample sites 14 and 21 days after the fire started, Many females were observed transporting pollen, indicative of active nest provisioning. Among the guild of bees surveyed at wild sunflowers (the only surviving flowering plant), fewer species were active within the burn. Guild composition was significantly altered, particularly by loss or depletion of several (but not all) sunflower specialists. Sex ratios did not shift, possibly due to surviving males aggregating in remaining patches of sunflowers.",,,,"Cane, James H/C-1636-2019","Cane, James H/0000-0002-4745-382X",,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,1365-2311,,,,JUN,2016,41,3,,,,,317,326,,10.1111/een.12304,,,,,,,WOS:000379942100010,,,,,

We found that pollen foragers had more-concentrated nectar (61.8 %) than nectar foragers (43.8 %). Further analysis revealed that the sugar concentration of the crop load increased significantly with waggle duration, an indicator of food-source distance, in both groups of foragers. Crop volume also increased with waggle duration. The results support our argument that foragers use concentrated nectar when the need for sugar is high and suggest that they precisely adjust the amount of sugar in the crop by altering both volume and nectar concentrations. We also investigated the impact of the area where foragers receive nectar on the crop load concentration at departure. Although nectar and pollen foragers tend to load nectar at different areas in the nest, area did not have a significant effect on crop load concentration.

Many non-rewarding orchid species mimic the signals of co-occurring food flowers and thereby attract food-seeking animal pollinators. These signals are often visually complex with a colour pattern that contrasts between outer and central parts. The significance of this colour complexity for the pollination success of flowers of deceptive orchids has scarcely been investigated. 2. We tested the effects of the colour patterns of the food-deceptive orchid Paphiopedilum micranthum on bumblebee visitation choices and pollination success using behavioural experiments in a community context. Using comparative phylogenetic analysis and a bee vision model, we also compared the colour patterns of P. micranthum with those of its congeners and sympatric food flowers. 3. The probability of both long-range approach and close-up choice by bumblebees to orchids was all enhanced in communities with food flowers similar in colour pattern to the orchid. Probability of long-range approach and close-up choice was negatively correlated with colour distance between orchid and food flowers in floral outer and centre, respectively. Flowers of P. micranthum that were manipulated to reduce visual complexity had reduced male and female pollination success. 4. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the outer floral colour of P. micranthum is apomorphic and thus likely represents an evolutionary innovation, whereas the central colour is plesiomorphic and thus likely to function in the bumblebee pollination system as an exaptation. The contrast between the inner and outer colours appears to exploit visual preferences of bumblebees acquired during foraging on local food plants with similar colour patterns. 5.

Thus, food sites should often be visited in order of proximity. However, resources vary in multiple attributes, so it may be beneficial to bypass some sites to visit others first. We used a foraging experiment on wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda to determine whether they prioritize high-reward food sites over low-reward sites. Five baited platforms were set in a pentagon within the range of one group. Trials usually consisted of single foragers but when multiple individuals participated, food competition occurred. In phase 1, platforms were baited equally. Individuals immediately found the shortest path and there was no relationship between experience and distance travelled. From phase 1, expected numbers of first visits to each platform were calculated for phases 2 and 3, where one or two platforms were six times more rewarding than others. In combined results from all trials with high-reward sites, individuals did not travel to highly rewarding platforms first, unless competitors were present. Vervets that foraged alone usually accessed food sites in order of proximity and saved on travel costs (consistent with a nearest-neighbour rule or a convex hull heuristic), regardless of the location of high-reward site(s); while monkeys in competition prioritized high-reward sites (a 'take-the-best' or gravity heuristic) and sometimes bypassed low-reward sites in an attempt to increase food acquisition at the expense of travel costs. When two sites were six times more rewarding, travel patterns changed to a greater focus on high-reward sites by single foragers and a tendency to ignore low-reward platforms. These results confirm that vervets integrate distance/reward information over multiple food sources, show spatial discounting in the right circumstances and optimize their routing decisions in different ways depending on the social context.

Flowering crops offer pulsed and abundant floral resources (i.e., mass flowering crops) that might promote pollinator spill-over between cultivated and adjacent natural areas. We explored pollinator patterns in the mass flowering legume crop Hedysarum coronarium and its influence on the bee pollinator communities of adjacent shrublands in a heterogeneous and patchy agricultural landscape: We studied the temporal (i.e., during vs. after mass flowering in adjacent shrublands) and spatial (i.e., inside crops, adjacent and distant shrublands during mass flowering) functional pollinator spill-over. The honeybee was highly attracted to Hedysarum crops, yet its abundance and that of other bee species visiting native plants in adjacent shrublands did not differ during and after Hedysarum mass flowering. However, at the landscape scale, the honeybee and the other bee species were less abundant in shrublands adjacent to Hedysarum crops compared to distant ones; their visitation rates showing a similar trend. These results show that some mass flowering crops can influence pollinator patterns in the surrounding landscape by competing for generalist pollinators with native plants. The characteristics of the crop species and the landscape can modulate and determine the role of mass flowering crops as competitors or supporters of wild pollinators for adjacent natural areas.

Here, we analyze how bee abundance and their effects on cucumber production in tropical homegardens is driven by factors measured on three spatial scales; the (1) homegarden scale (flower cover of the focal homegarden); the (2) adjacent-habitat scale (amount of homegarden habitat within a 200 m radius around the focal homegarden); and the (3) landscape scale (distance of the focal homegarden to the nearest forest from 0 to 2200 m). We also evaluate bee responses according to functional traits such as body size. We found that bees were affected by factors on multiple spatial scales. On the homegarden scale, the percentage flower cover best predicted pollinator attraction, if, on the adjacent-habitat scale the percentage of surrounding homegardens was at least 20%. On the landscape scale, bee abundance, mainly of small species, increased when homegardens were closer to the forest. Increasing abundance of flower-visiting bees increased cucumber yield, with solitary bees being the most abundant flower visitors. We predicted that a 50% loss in bee abundance would translate into a 47% yield and associated income decline. Homegardens with a flower cover of 50%, being surrounded by a homegarden area of 50% and being established <100 m from the forest can translate in a nine-fold higher yield and income compared to homegardens with low flower cover (<15%), and isolated from other homegardens (<20%) and the forest (>1500 m). Our work suggests that farmers need to be aware of management practices not only at the local and landscape scale but also on the adjacent-habitat scale. Only then farmers can increase wild bee populations to reduce crop yield gaps through pollination services. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, high honey bee densities may have an impact on local pollen and nectar availability, which in turn may negatively affect other pollinators. This is exacerbated by the ability of honey bees to recruit foragers to highly rewarding flower patches. We measured floral resource consumption in rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris) in 21 plots located at different distances from apiaries in the scrubland of Garraf Natural Park (Barcelona), and related these measures to visitation rates of honey bees, bumblebees (Bombes terrestris) and other pollinators. In the same plots, we measured flower density, and used pan traps to characterize the wild bee community. Flower resource consumption was largely explained by honey bee visitation and marginally by bumblebee visitation. Ada accounting for flower density, plots close to apiaries had lower wild bee biomass. This was due to a lower abundance of large bee species, those more likely to be affected by honey bee competition+ We conclude that honey bees are the main contributors to pollen/nectar consumption of the two main dowering plants in the scrubland, and that at the densities currently occurring in the park (3.5 hives/km(2)) the wild bee community is being affected.

We tested predictions of FoF in two globally invasive fire ants, Solenopsis geminata (FABRICIUS, 1804) and S. invicta (BUREN, 1972). Colonies of these species may produce two different monogyne queen types-claustral queens with heavy abdomens that found colonies independently, and parasitic queens with small abdomens that enter conspecific nests. Claustral and parasitic queens were similarly sized, but the abdomens of claustral queens weighed twice as much as those of their parasitic counterparts. Their heavier abdomens adversely impacted morphological predictors of flight ability, resulting in 32-38% lower flight muscle ratios, 55-63% higher wing loading, and 32-33% higher abdomen drag. In lab experiments maximum flight durations in claustral S. invicta queens decreased by about 18 minutes for every milligram of abdomen mass. Combining our results into a simple fitness tradeoff model, we calculated that an average parasitic S. invicta queen could produce only 1/3 as many worker offspring as a claustral queen, but could fly 4 times as long and have a 17-to 36-fold larger potential colonization area.

Across the three pollinator groups, we found pronounced areal range expansions (>53%) and modelled range shifts towards the north (all taxa: 17-22 km), west (bees: 14 km) and east (butterflies: 11 km). The importance of specific functional traits for explaining distributional changes varied among pollinator groups. Larval diet preferences (i.e. carnivorous vs. herbivorous/detritivorous and nitrogen values of host plants, respectively) were important for hoverflies and butterflies, adult body size for hoverflies, and flight period length for all groups.

The bivoltine bee Andrena bicolor is reported to be polylectic and oligolectic (on Campanula) in the spring and summer generations, respectively. Neurological constraints are assumed to govern pollen diet in bees. However, evidence comes predominantly from studies with oligolectic bees. We have investigated how sensory constraints influence the innate foraging behavior of A. bicolor and have tested whether bees of different generations evolved behavioral and sensory polyphenism to cope better with the host flowers available in nature when they are active. Results: Behavioral and sensory polyphenisms were tested in choice assays and electroantennographic analyses, respectively. In the bioassays, we found that females of both generations (1) displayed a similar innate relative reliance on visual and olfactory floral cues irrespective of the host plants tested; (2) did not prefer floral cues of Campanula to those of Taraxacum (or vice versa) and (3) did not display an innate preference for yellow and lilac colors. In the electroantennographic analyses, we found that bees of both generations responded to the same set of compounds. Conclusion: Overall, we did not detect seasonal polyphenism in any trait examined. The finding that bees of both generations are not sensory constrained to visit a specific host flower, which is in strict contrast to results from studies with oligolectic bees, suggest that also bees of the second generation have a flexibility in innate foraging behavior and that this is an adaptive trait in A. bicolor.

Because of its exponential diffusion and its serious threat to the local honeybee colonies (and to humans as well), restraint measures are currently under investigation. We developed and tested an harmonic radar capable of tracking the flying trajectory of these insects, once equipped with a small transponder, in their natural environment. Several hornets were captured close to a small cluster of honeybee hives, tagged with different transponders and then released in order to follow the flight toward their nest. On-field testing proved an initial maximum detection range of about 125m in a hilly and woody area. A number of detections were clearly recorded, and preferential directions of flight were identified. The system herein described is intended as a first low-cost harmonic radar; it proved the capability to track the hornets while flying and it permitted to test the tagging techniques. Several upgrades of the system have been identified during this work and are extensively described in the last chapter. The designed system has three major advantages over conventional harmonic radars. First and most importantly, it adopts advanced processing techniques to suppress clutter and to improve target detection. Second, it allows radar operations in complex environments, generally hilly and rich in vegetation.

Their contribution to this essential ecosystem service has been threatened over recent decades by changes in land use, which have led to declines in their populations. In order to design effective conservation measures, it is important to understand the effects of variation in landscape composition and structure on the foraging activities of worker bumble bees. This is because the viability of individual colonies is likely to be affected by the trade-off between the energetic costs of foraging over greater distances and the potential gains from access to additional resources. We used field surveys, molecular genetics, and fine resolution remote sensing to estimate the locations of wild bumble bee nests and to infer foraging distances across a 20-km(2) agricultural landscape in southern England, UK. We investigated five species, including the rare B. ruderatus and ecologically similar but widespread B. hortorum. We compared worker foraging distances between species and examined how variation in landscape composition and structure affected foraging distances at the colony level. Mean worker foraging distances differed significantly between species. Bombus terrestris, B. lapidarius, and B. ruderatus exhibited significantly greater mean foraging distances (551, 536, and 501 m, respectively) than B. hortorum and B. pascuorum (336 and 272 m, respectively). There was wide variation in worker foraging distances between colonies of the same species, which was in turn strongly influenced by the amount and spatial configuration of available foraging habitats. Shorter foraging distances were found for colonies where the local landscape had high coverage and low fragmentation of seminatural vegetation, including managed agri-environmental field margins. The strength of relationships between different landscape variables and foraging distance varied between species, for example the strongest relationship for B. ruderatus being with floral cover of preferred forage plants. Our findings suggest that management of landscape composition and configuration has the potential to reduce foraging distances across a range of bumble bee species. There is thus potential for improvements in the design and implementation of landscape management options, such as agri-environment schemes, aimed at providing foraging habitat for bumble bees and enhancing crop pollination services.",,,,"Redhead, John/E-6750-2012; Bourke, Andrew/E-5271-2011","Redhead, John/0000-0002-2233-3848; Sumner, Seirian/0000-0003-0213-2018",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,APR,2016,26,3,,,,,726,739,,10.1890/15-0546,,,,,,,WOS:000374840500007,27411246,,,,

However, colony density and arrangement strategies are not generally based on replicated scientific trials, so there is considerable uncertainty regarding effectiveness of different practices. We address this problem with experiments in almond orchards in south-east Australia, considering impacts on honeybee pollen foraging and fruit set. We examined the effect of distance from colony location on the depletion rate of pollen from flowers near (similar to 40m) and far (260-490m) from colonies in almond orchards. We assessed pollen loads of 950 flowers in total, collected at four times of day (9-9:30h, 11-11:30h, 13-13:30h and 15-15:30h), from 8 near:far pairs. We also surveyed fruit set on nearly 900 trees in replicated transects over two seasons to determine the effect of distance from colony when using large placements of colonies (similar to 120 colonies, N=581 trees), and effect of colony density when using smaller placements of colonies (N=313 trees). Flowers near colonies maintained an approximately constant mean pollen load over the course of the day, indicating that the rate of pollen released by flowers was matched by the rate of pollen collection by bees. Flowers far from colonies increased in pollen load over the course of the day, indicating relatively less pollen-collecting activity, so that by 15:30h they had, on average, 46% more than flowers near colonies. Fruit set declined with distance by 22% over 850m, consistent with the observation that pollen foraging declines over distance from colony. Fruit setalso declined with colony density from 46% at 68 colonies per ha to 33% at 28 colonies per ha. Synthesis and applications. Pollen-collecting activity is relatively low at flowers far from honeybee colonies, creating a risk of lost yield through underpollination.

Nutritional models suggest that social information transfer increases the ability of foragers with closely aligned nutritional needs to find nutrients and maintain a balanced diet. However, whether or not collective foraging is adaptive in a heterogeneous group composed of individuals with differing nutritional needs is virtually unexplored. Here we develop an evolutionary agent-based model using concepts of nutritional ecology to address this knowledge gap. Our aim was to evaluate how collective foraging, mediated by social retention on foods, can improve nutrient balancing in individuals with different requirements. The model suggests that in groups where inter-individual nutritional needs are unimodally distributed, high levels of collective foraging yield optimal individual fitness by reducing search times that result from moving between nutritionally imbalanced foods. However, where nutritional needs are highly bimodal (e.g. where the requirements of males and females differ) collective foraging is selected against, leading to group fission. In this case, additional mechanisms such as assortative interactions can coevolve to allow collective foraging by subgroups of individuals with aligned requirements.

In the present work we analyze social communication processes used by V. germanica when exploiting undepleted food sources. For this purpose, we investigated the arrival pattern of wasps at a protein bait and evaluated whether a forager recruited conspecifics in three different situations: foragers were able to return to the nest (full communication), foragers were removed on arrival (communication impeded), or only one forager was allowed to return to the nest (local enhancement restricted). Results demonstrated the existence of recruitment in V. germanica, given that very different patterns of wasp arrivals and a higher frequency of wasp visits to the resource were observed when communication flow between experienced and naive foragers was allowed. Our findings showed that recruitment takes place at a distance from the food source, in addition to local enhancement. When both local enhancement and distant recruitment were occurring simultaneously, the pattern of wasp arrival was exponential. When recruitment occurred only distant from the feeder, the arrival pattern was linear, but the number of wasps arriving was twice as many as when neither communication nor local enhancement was allowed. Moreover, when return to the nest was impeded, wasp arrival at the bait was regular and constant, indicating that naive wasps forage individually and are not spatially aggregated. In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate recruitment in V. germanica at a distance from the food source by modelling wasps' arrival to a protein-based resource.

These relationships are often phylogenetically shared; thus quantifying allometric relationships may allow for estimating difficult-to-measure traits across species. One such trait, proboscis length in bees, is assumed to be important in structuring bee communities and plant-pollinator networks. However, it is difficult to measure and thus rarely included in ecological analyses. We measured intertegular distance (as a measure of body size) and proboscis length (glossa and prementum, both individually and combined) of 786 individual bees of 100 species across 5 of the 7 extant bee families (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila). Using linear models and model selection, we determined which parameters provided the best estimate of proboscis length. We then used coefficients to estimate the relationship between intertegular distance and proboscis length, while also considering family. Using allometric equations with an estimation for a scaling coefficient between intertegular distance and proboscis length and coefficients for each family, we explain 91% of the variance in species-level means for bee proboscis length among bee species. However, within species, individual-level intertegular distance was a poor predictor of individual proboscis length. To make our findings easy to use, we created an R package that allows estimation of proboscis length for individual bee species by inputting only family and intertegular distance. The R package also calculates foraging distance and body mass based on previously published equations. Thus by considering both taxonomy and intertegular distance we enable accurate estimation of an ecologically and evolutionarily important trait.",,,,"Gibbs, Jason/B-9353-2018; Cariveau, Daniel/AAB-9336-2020","Gibbs, Jason/0000-0002-4945-5423; ",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Mar-17,2016,11,3,,,,,,,e0151482,10.1371/journal.pone.0151482,,,,,,,WOS:000372580300076,26986000,,,,

However, the individual salt preferences of water-collecting bees were not known. We measured the proboscis extension reflex (PER) response of Apis mellifera water foragers to 0-10% w/w solutions of Na, Mg and K, ions that provide essential nutrients. We also tested phosphate, which can deter foraging. Bees exhibited significant preferences, with the most PER responses for 1.5-3% Na and 1.5% Mg. However, K and phosphate were largely aversive and elicited PER responses only for the lowest concentrations, suggesting a way to deter bees from visiting contaminated water. We then analyzed the salt content of water sources that bees collected in urban and semi-urban environments. Bees collected water with a wide range of salt concentrations, but most collected water sources had relatively low salt concentrations, with the exception of seawater and swimming pools, which had >0.6% Na. The high levels of PER responsiveness elicited by 1.5-3% Na may explain why bees are willing to collect such salty water. Interestingly, bees exhibited high individual variation in salt preferences: individual identity accounted for 32% of variation in PER responses. Salt specialization may therefore occur in water foragers.",,,,"Nieh, James/H-8705-2014","Nieh, James/0000-0001-6237-0726; Lau, Pierre/0000-0002-9755-2949",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,Mar-15,2016,219,6,,,,,790,796,,10.1242/jeb.132019,,,,,,,WOS:000372061500008,26823100,,,,

Pollinator-dependent crops rely on mobile animals like bees for crop production, and the spatial relationship between floral resources and nest location for these central-place foragers influences the delivery of pollination services. Current models that map pollination coverage in agricultural regions utilize landscape-level estimates of floral availability and nesting incidence inferred from expert opinion, rather than direct assessments. Foraging distance is often derived from proxies of bee body size, rather than direct measurements of foraging that account for behavioral responses to floral resource type and distribution. The lack of direct measurements of nesting incidence and foraging distances may lead to inaccurate mapping of pollination services. We examined the role of local-scale floral resource presence from hedgerow plantings on nest incidence of ground-nesting bees in field margins and within monoculture, conventionally managed sunflower fields in California's Central Valley. We tracked bee movement into fields using fluorescent powder. We then used these data to simulate the distribution of pollination services within a crop field. Contrary to expert opinion, we found that ground-nesting native bees nested both in fields and edges, though nesting rates declined with distance into field. Further, we detected no effect of field-margin floral enhancements on nesting. We found evidence of an exponential decay rate of bee movement into fields, indicating that foraging predominantly occurred in less than 1% of medium-sized bees' predicted typical foraging range. Although we found native bees nesting within agricultural fields, their restricted foraging movements likely centralize pollination near nest sites. Our data thus predict a heterogeneous distribution of pollination services within sunflower fields, with edges receiving higher coverage than field centers. To generate more accurate maps of services, we advocate directly measuring the autecology of ecosystem service providers, which vary by crop system, pollinator species, and region. Improving estimates of the factors affecting pollinator populations can increase the accuracy of pollination service maps and help clarify the influence of farming practices on wild bees occurring in agricultural landscapes.",,,,"Ponisio, Lauren C/C-3785-2019","Ponisio, Lauren C/0000-0002-3838-7357; Rominger, Andrew/0000-0003-3755-4480",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,MAR,2016,26,2,,,,,438,447,,10.1890/15-0033,,,,,,,WOS:000374118700010,27209786,,,,

Three years of data on the spatio-temporal distributions of 91 bee species show that seasonal patterns of abundance and species richness in human-altered landscapes varied significantly less compared to natural habitats in which floral resources are relatively scarce in the dry summer months.

Recent studies showed that diverse wild bee assemblages are more efficient pollinators than honeybees. In urban ecosystems pollination services are also important, for example for the reproduction of many plant species in parks, for the production of vegetables and fruits in home gardens, as well as other animals depending on bee-pollinated plants. 2. This study investigates the effect of 'urbanity' on the abundance, species richness and community structure of wild bees foraging at city trees and quantifies the contribution of wild bees and honeybees to successful pollination. Four common city tree species in Berlin, Germany, were sampled in three parks defined as ` green spaces' and compared with trees in more ` urban areas'. 3. In total, 57 wild bee species foraged at the observed trees representing 19 % of all known species in Berlin. Wild bee species richness showed only small differences between green spaces and urban areas even though social species were found more frequently in green areas. Wild bees visited flowers more frequently in green areas, whereas the numbers of honeybee flower visits were higher in urban areas. Wild bee but not honeybee flower visits showed a positive relationship with the reproductive success of trees. 4. The results suggest that wild bees are important pollinators of city trees that dominate the pollinator community in green spaces. To support wild bee communities green spaces should be preserved and tree species with floral reward should be planted and preserved in urban areas.",,,,"Petermann, Jana/E-2130-2013","Petermann, Jana/0000-0002-3898-5656",,,,,,,,,,,,1752-458X,1752-4598,,,,MAR,2016,9,2,,,,,97,107,,10.1111/icad.12145,,,,,,,WOS:000371223200002,,,,,

We provide detailed data showing that N. ceranae infection significantly accelerated the age polyethism of young bees, causing them to exhibit behaviours typical of older bees. Bees with high N. ceranae spore counts had significantly increased walking rates and decreased attraction to queen mandibular pheromone. Infected bees also exhibited higher rates of trophallaxis (food exchange), potentially reflecting parasite manipulation to increase colony infection.

J,"Shepherd, M; Lee, DJ",,,,"Shepherd, Mervyn; Lee, David J.",,,Gene flow from Corymbia hybrids in northern New South Wales,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"Some of the most productive taxa for forestry are interspecific F-1 hybrids grown as exotics in the tropics and subtropics. Attributes of resilience, adaptability and vigour which engender the hybrids for wood production, may also exacerbate the risk they present from gene flow to native species gene pools or to local ecologies as weeds. To determine the biological and genetic factors that influence the extent of hybridisation, we examine the distribution and genealogy of wildlings surrounding plantings of locally-exotic Corymbia torelliana (Section Cadageria) near native C. henryi (Section Maculatae) in northern New South Wales. Our study showed pre-mating and pre- and post-zygotic barriers were incomplete, with in situ generation and natural establishment of both F-1 hybrids (n = 3) and advanced generation hybrids under the disturbed conditions bordering native forest. As hybrids were located on alluvial flats exposed to frost, they also likely have an extended ecological range relative to native C. henryi. Despite the likely generation of large viable seed crops on F-1 trees at the site over many years, establishment success and survival of advanced generation hybrids may be low, as only 5 immature and no mature advanced generation hybrids were identified. Propagation and genetic analysis of a seed crop from one F-1 wildling showed early survival and vigour of seedlings in cultivation was high, and that at least for some F-1 in some seasons, backcrossing to the recurrent native C henryi parent is favoured (60%), whereas selfing (10%) and crossing with other F-1 (30%) was less frequent. Transport of seed by stingless bees probably accounted for long distance dispersal from C torelliana, but this mechanism does not appear to supplement gravity-dispersal of seed from the F-1. Coupled with other evidence from studies of bee behaviour, controlled pollination in Corymbia sp., and long-term fitness in second generation eucalypt hybrids, we anticipate gene flow via pollen rather than seed will be the greater challenge for managing the risk of introgression of C. torelliana ancestry into native species from the planted F-1 hybrid. If large sources of F-1 pollen become available to compete with native pollen, gene flow will probably be frequent and hybrids may establish in disturbed conditions and in habitats beyond the ecological range of their native parent. Further study is needed to determine the degree to which outbreeding depression and poor survival inhibits on-going gene flow. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Because termites have unique life-history traits and significant interspecific differences exist regarding their nesting and foraging habits, comparative studies on PO activity can shed light on the general principles influencing immune investment against the backdrop of sociality, reproductive potential, and gender. We quantified PO activity across four termite species ranging from the phylogenetically basal to the most derived, each with their particular nesting/foraging strategies. Our data indicate that PO activity varies across species, with soil-dwelling termites exhibiting significantly higher PO levels than the aboveground wood nester species which in turn have higher PO levels than arboreal species. Moreover, our comparative approach suggests that pathogenic risks can override reproductive potential as a more important driver of immune investment. No gender-based differences in PO activities were recorded. Although termite PO activity levels vary in accordance with a priori predictions made from life-history theory, our data indicate that nesting and foraging strategies (and their resulting pathogenic pressures) can supersede reproductive potential and other life-history traits in influencing investment in PO. Termites, within the eusocial insects, provide a unique perspective for inferring how different ecological pressures may have influenced immune function in general and their levels of PO activity, in particular.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-1042,1432-1904,,,,FEB,2016,103,1-Feb,,,,,,,UNSP 14,10.1007/s00114-016-1338-3,,,,,,,WOS:000370876000014,26838762,,,,

To investigate the effects of changing conditions on fitness, we conducted field experiments using the central-place-foraging alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundata), examining the changes in sex allocation when presented with changes in flight distance required to obtain resources. The results suggest that changes in flight distance to resources during the year's flight season altered subsequent allocation decisions: mothers experiencing long flight distance to resources early in the season and short flight distance later in the season generated a greater proportion of female offspring than mothers experiencing the opposite. During the second half of the season, however, it was current experimental conditions significantly impacting decisions with those mothers residing near the resources producing a greater portion of female offspring than those far from resources, regardless of flight distances experienced earlier in the year.

The cultivation of lulo outside of its native range, for example in European glasshouses, requires the presence of efficient pollinators to enable high fruit set and yield. Until now, the suitability of Bombus terrestris L., native to Europe and commonly used in agriculture, has been untested for this purpose. In this study, the pollen-collecting behaviour of B. terrestris when visiting lulo flowers was investigated. It was shown that B. terrestris adopted the lulo as a pollen source, and on average visited three flowers per minute, had five buzzing events per stay and foraged for 15 s on a single flower, independently of the previous number of visits and level of bruising to the anthers. The pollination efficiency of five different treatments was evaluated: (i) exclusion of bees, (ii) single and (iii) multiple visits of B. terrestris, (iv) self- and (v) cross-pollination by hand. The results clearly demonstrated that, for fruit set, pollination is crucial. It was also found that lulo flowers can be successfully self- pollinated, but give 25% fewer fruit set compared with pollination via multiple bumblebee visits, or cross-pollination by hand. Fruit set, seed set and fruit size were as high with pollination by B. terrestris as with cross-pollination by hand, indicating that this bumblebee is an appropriate pollinator for lulo. However, B. terrestris was conspicuously less effective when a flower was visited only once. Therefore, when growing lulos commercially, multiple bumblebee visits should be encouraged, but it is likely that the behaviour of B. terrestris would ensure this anyway.

For that reason, the development of a protocol to standardize thermal assays is necessary. In this sense, infrared thermography solves some of the problems allowing us to take continuous temperature measurements without handling the individuals, an important fact in cold-blooded organisms like insects. Here, we present a working protocol based on infrared thermography to estimate both cold and heat thermal stress in insects. We analyse both the change in the body temperature of individuals and their behavioural response. In addition, we used partial least squares regression for the statistical analysis of our data, a technique that solves the problem of having a large number of variables and few individuals, allowing us to work with rare or endemic species. To test our protocol, we chose two species of congeneric, narrowly distributed dung beetles that are endemic to the southeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. With our protocol we have obtained five variables in the response to cold and twelve in the response to heat. With this methodology we discriminate between the two flightless species of Jekelius through their thermal response. In response to cold, Jekelius hernandezi showed a higher rate of cooling and reached higher temperatures of stupor and haemolymph freezing than Jekelius punctatolineatus. Both species displayed similar thermoregulation ranges before reaching lethal body temperature with heat stress. Overall, we have demonstrated that infrared thermography is a suitable method to assess insect thermal responses with a high degree of sensitivity, allowing for the discrimination between closely related species.

D.",,,Determination of selected environmental contaminants in foraging honeybees,TALANTA,,,,,,,,,,,,"Colony losses of honeybees have been of great concern in the last years. To explain these losses, several studies have been reported, and various factors, such as pathogens and pesticides, have been considered as possible causes. Nevertheless, organic contaminants, rather than pesticides, are continuously released to the environment, and can be intercepted by honeybees during foraging with the possible consequent damage. Azoles and organophosphorus esters have been selected in this work as environmental contaminants to be monitored in honeybees. A fast and robust method has been developed to determine these organic pollutants in honeybees. It is based on matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD), which performs sample dispersion with extraction and clean up in the same step, followed by LC-ESI-MS/MS determination. Recoveries of the method varied between 73% and 119% and MQLs ranged from 0.8 to 4 ng g(-1). Honeybee samples from ten apiaries located in different regions were analyzed applying the developed method. Azole compounds were found at low levels, but not in all samples, while organophosphorus esters were found in most samples whatever location. Tris-(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate, TCPP, and tributyl phosphate, TBP, were detected in all honeybees samples at levels higher than the rest of organophosphates analyzed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While most pesticide research has focused on honey bees, there has been less work on native bee populations. To determine the exposure of native bees to pesticides, bees were collected from an existing research area in northeastern Colorado in both grasslands (20132014) and wheat fields (2014). Traps were deployed bi-monthly during the summer at each land cover type and all bees, regardless of species, were composited as whole samples and analyzed for 136 current-use pesticides and degradates. This reconnaissance approach provides a sampling of all species and represents overall pesticide exposure (internal and external). Nineteen pesticides and degradates were detected in 54 composite samples collected. Compounds detected in >2% of the samples included: insecticides thiamethoxam (46%), bifenthrin (28%), clothianidin (24%), chlorpyrifos (17%), imidacloprid (13%), fipronil desulfinyl (7%; degradate); fungicides azoxystrobin (17%), pyraclostrobin (11%), fluxapyroxad (9%), and propiconazole (9%); herbicides atrazine (19%) andmetolachlor (9%). Concentrations ranged from 1 to 310 ng/g for individual pesticides. Pesticides were detected in samples collected from both grasslands and wheat fields; the location of the sample and the surrounding land cover at the 1000 m radius influenced the pesticides detected but because of a small number of temporally comparable samples, correlations between pesticide concentration and land cover were not significant. The results show native bees collected in an agricultural landscape are exposed to multiple pesticides, these results can direct future research on routes/timing of pesticide exposure and the design of future conservation efforts for pollinators.

Considering its natural origin, pollen may be contaminated with pollutants due to hidden environmental factors and extensive application of pesticides. Because of their environmental persistence and prevalence in various environmental mediums, POPs can be encountered by forage bees and carried back to hives. The aim of the present study was to develop an analytical method for simultaneous determination of trace levels of 16 PAHs, 14 OCPs and 7 PCBs in bee pollen. Methods: A new method was developed using QuEChERS/GC-MS. For the initial extraction step, QuEChERS Extract Tubes based on the AOAC method for the acetate-buffered version were used. The following tubes were used for the subsequent cleanup step: dispersive tubes. Results: Recoveries of target analytes under optimized conditions ranged from 51.3% to 138.8%. Limits of detection and limits of quantification were lesser or equal to 5.8 and 19.2 mu g/kg, respectively. The correlation coefficients of 37 target analytes were higher than 0.99. This study lays the foundation for the further research into bee pollen as an environmental indicator. Conclusion: The method is simple, economical, effective and robust for simultaneous analysis of 37 kinds of POPs in bee pollen matrix.

The survey was conducted in 2009-2012, in the Lublin Province, SE Poland. Data on the bee forage flora were obtained while making floristic charts along 60 transect plots x 300 m, with a total length of 18 000 m, for each type of linear structure. Forage bee flora was compared with respect to species richness, diversity, and evenness indices. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to characterize relationship between species composition and environmental variables. The bee forage species richness and abundance were significantly greater on railway embankments than on road verges. The composition of species varied considerably; the number of bee forage species common to both habitats was only approximately 38% in entire data set. Most good-value bee forage species were recorded along the embankments of railways with an intermediate traffic volume. Bee forage species diversity benefits from the location of habitat elements (forests or meadows), primarily if the distance is <50 m. The lack of dense patches of valuable bee forage species in the road verges was related to the high density of non-nectariferous graminoids. Our results demonstrate how the value of man-made areas in an agricultural ecosystem can vary with respect to floral resources across the landscape, suggesting that it is inappropriate to generalize about agricultural systems as a whole without first addressing differences among habitats.",,,,,"Wrzesien, Malgorzata/0000-0002-9503-5403; Denisow, Bozena/0000-0001-6718-7496",,,,,,,,,,,,0001-6977,2083-9480,,,,,2016,85,3,,,,,,,UNSP 3509,10.5586/asbp.3509,,,,,,,WOS:000385711100008,,,,,

Each bee species has long been reported to exhibit unique foraging patterns and time, and it is very likely that bee foraging activities play a significant role in the phenolic composition of honeys. This work aims to justify the potential relationship between species-specific foraging activities and phenolic composition of honeys, to distinguish polyphenolic profiles and to identify possible floral markers in each type of Malaysian honey studied. Seventeen samples of Malaysian gelam, acacia, nenas, tualang, and kelulut honeys were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Total phenolic contents ranged from 1.92 to 14.84 mg/g of honey, in nenas and gelam honey, respectively. Fifteen phenolic compounds were identified, probably affected by the bee foraging preference. The highest number was seen in kelulut honey (Trigona spp.) while the lowest were in tualang honey (10 compounds, Apis dorsata). Apis cerana indica showed the highest phenolic acid and flavonoid contents (8.74 mg/g honey) compared to the other bee species, probably due to less selective floral preference, longer duration and early foraging time as well as small body size that influence their foraging activity. Similarity in two dominant polyphenols from polyhenolic profiles between acacia and tualang honeys (naringenin and ellagic acid), and between gelam and kelulut honeys (ellagic acid and benzoic acid) suggesting that the floral source of unifloral honey is an equally important food source for the analyzed multifloral honey, was confirmed by PCA analysis. This work assumes that competition between bee species for nectar and pollen might exist, affecting honey production and total polyphenolic content. From the results, some polyphenolic profiles could be regarded as possible floral markers of Malaysian unifloral honeys, with very consistent profiles observed in nenas honeys.",,,,"Zulkifli, Razauden M/D-6696-2018; SINGH, OM PRAKASH/Q-7479-2019; Ismail, Norjihada Izzah/V-7002-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8839,2078-6913,,,,,2016,55,2,,,,,137,150,,10.1080/00218839.2016.1207388,,,,,,,WOS:000385237000003,,,,,

We monitored bumblebee populations (Bombus spp.) in 14 grassland patches incorporated into the agricultural habitat mosaic in the Mezofold region, Hungary. We asked how bumblebee populations were affected by local vegetation quality and the presence of various landscape elements, including fields in agri-environmental schemes, at various spatial scales. A stratified analysis revealed that vegetation quality, especially the lack of weeds, was the most important local factor that positively affected both bumblebee abundance and species number. We found no significant landscape scale effects between 50-250 m. Between 500-1000 m grassland area in the landscape had consistently significant positive effect on species richness. At the 2 km scale the extent of arable fields had a negative impact on both abundance and richness. A higher percentage area of arable fields in the landscape participating in agri-environmental schemes had no positive effect on bumblebee abundance or species richness. Considering all local and landscape effects and their possible interactions, model selection and variance partitioning revealed that local factors were the most important determinants of bumblebee richness and abundance. Local and landscape factors had high shared variance but did not interact with each other. The present study indicated that small scale landscape composition had the lowest importance, but larger scale landscape composition was significant, most likely because bumblebees can forage far from their nests. If we are able to provide good quality grassland patches incorporated into the agricultural habitat mosaic, then we can build on the strong spill over propensity of bumblebees and can expect their contribution to the pollination of various crops.",,,,"Szita, Eva/AAF-6659-2020; Samu, Ferenc/B-2827-2011","Szita, Eva/0000-0001-6335-5296; Samu, Ferenc/0000-0002-6591-2284",,,,,,,,,,,,1217-8837,,,,,,2016,62,4,,,,,387,407,,10.17109/AZH.62.4.387.2016,,,,,,,WOS:000384440700005,,,,,

We examine the biogeography and demography of C. australensis using haplotype variation at 677 bp of the barcoding region of COI for specimens sampled from four populations within Australia, across Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. There is geographic population structure in haplotypes, suggesting an origin in the northeastern populations, spreading to southern Australia. Bayesian Skyline Plot analyses indicate that population size began to increase approximately 18,000 years ago, roughly corresponding to the end of the last glacial maximum. Population expansion then began to plateau approximately 6,000 years ago, which may correspond to a slowing or plateauing in global temperatures for the current interglacial period.

Flower colour is responsible for attraction from a distance, whereas contrasting colour patterns within flowers aid orientation of flower visitors after approaching the flowers. Due to the striking differences in colour vision systems and neural processing across animal taxa, flower colours evoke specific behavioural responses by different flower visitors. We tested whether and how yellow flowers differ in their spectral reflectance depending on the main pollinator. We focused on bees and birds and examined whether the presence or absence of the widespread UV reflectance pattern of yellow flowers predicts the main pollinator. Most bee-pollinated flowers displayed a pattern with UV-absorbing centres and UV-reflecting peripheries, whereas the majority of bird-pollinated flowers are entirely UV-absorbing. In choice experiments we found that bees did not show consistent preferences for any colour or pattern types. However, all tested bee species made their first antennal contact preferably at the UV-absorbing area of the artificial flower, irrespective of its spatial position within the flower. The appearance of UV patterns within flowers is the main difference in spectral reflectance between yellow bee-and bird-pollinated flowers, and affects the foraging behaviour of flower visitors.

Compared to trophic and competitive interactions, the role of non-trophic facilitation among species has received less attention. Cavity-nesting bees nest in old beetle borings in dead wood, with restricted diameters corresponding to the body size of the bee species. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the functional diversity of cavity-producing wood boring beetles - in terms of cavity diameters - drives the size diversity of cavity-nesting bees. The invertebrate communities were sampled in 30 sites, located in forested landscapes along an elevational gradient. We regressed the species richness and abundance of cavity nesting bees against the species richness and abundance of wood boring beetles, non-wood boring beetles and elevation. The proportion of cavity nesting bees in bee species assemblage was regressed against the species richness and abundance of wood boring beetles. We also tested the relationships between the size diversity of cavity nesting bees and wood boring beetles. The species richness and abundance of cavity nesting bees increased with the species richness and abundance of wood boring beetles. No such relationship was found for non-wood boring beetles. The abundance of wood boring beetles was also related to an increased proportion of cavity nesting bee individuals. Moreover, the size diversity of cavity-nesting bees increased with the functional diversity of wood boring beetles. Specifically, the mean and dispersion of bee body sizes increased with the functional dispersion of large wood boring beetles. The positive relationships between cavity producing bees and cavity nesting bees suggest that non-trophic facilitative interactions between species assemblages play important roles in organizing bee species assemblages.

Here, we apply a decision framework, specifically developed to identify and prioritise climate change adaptation actions and demonstrate its use for 30 species threatened in the UK. Our aim is to assess whether government conservation recommendations remain appropriate under a changing climate. The species, associated with three different habitats (lowland heath, broadleaved woodland and calcareous grassland), were selected from a range of taxonomic groups (primarily moths and vascular plants, but also including bees, bryophytes, carabid beetles and spiders). We compare the actions identified for these threatened species by the decision framework with those included in existing conservation plans, as developed by the UK Government's statutory adviser on nature conservation. We find that many existing conservation recommendations are also identified by the decision framework. However, there are large differences in the spatial prioritisation of actions when explicitly considering projected climate change impacts. This includes recommendations for actions to be carried out in areas where species do not currently occur, in order to allow them to track movement of suitable conditions for their survival. Uncertainties in climate change projections are not a reason to ignore them.

Bumblebees provide a useful model system to explore how different lifestyles are reflected in learning abilities, because their (female but sterile) workers and males engage in fundamentally different behaviour routines. Bumblebee males, like workers, embark on active flower foraging but in contrast to workers they have to trade off their feeding with mate search, potentially affecting their abilities to learn and utilize floral cues efficiently during foraging. We used a serial colour-learning task with freely flying males and workers to compare their ability to flexibly learn visual floral cues with reward in a foraging scenario that changed over time. Male bumblebees did not differ from workers in both their learning speed and their ability to overcome previously acquired associations, when these ceased to predict reward. In all foraging tasks we found a significant improvement in choice accuracy in both sexes over the course of the training. In both sexes, the characteristics of the foraging performance depended largely on the colour difference of the two presented feeder types. Large colour distances entailed fast and reliable learning of the rewarding feeders whereas choice accuracy on highly similar colours improved significantly more slowly. Conversely, switching from a learned feeder type to a novel one was fastest for similar feeder colours and slow for highly different ones. Overall, we show that behavioural sex dimorphism in bumblebees did not affect their learning abilities beyond the mating context. We discuss the possible drivers and limitations shaping the foraging abilities of males and workers and implications for pollination ecology. We also suggest stingless male bumblebees as an advantageous alternative model system for the study of pollinator cognition. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this context, we examined the effect of heterogeneous landscapes surrounding and including commercial apple orchards on pollinator visitation and foraging distance during bloom period from 2011 to 2013 in Pennsylvania. Our results showed that the frequency of feral honeybees and solitary bee visits within an apple orchard depends on the proximity of the orchard to an unmanaged habitat (primarily comprised of forest). At the landscape scale, we found that the Mean Proximity Index, the Largest Patch Index, and the Number of Patches positively correlated with the visitation rate of dominant bee taxa (Apis mellifera, Bombus spp., and solitary bees) visiting apple flowers at low spatial scales (up to 500 m around the orchards). The Mean Proximity Index at 500 m was related to bee visitation patterns, especially for solitary bees and A. mellifera. Bees in all our study sites preferred to forage in areas with large homogenous patches up to 500 m around an apple orchard. This effect can be attributed to the mass flowering of apples that formed the largest proportion of the 500 m spatial scale. The Number of Patches at 250 m spatial scale was positively correlated with bee visitation, especially Bombus spp., probably because these areas had more habitats and more resources required by these bees. We conclude that retaining unmanaged habitats closer to commercial apple orchards will maintain biodiversity within the landscapes and insure pollination services to apples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,,2016,4,,,,,,,,38,10.3389/fevo.2016.00038,,,,,,,WOS:000517761700038,,,,,

Thus, the variation in weather conditions during reproduction, mediated by prey limitations, should be mirrored in annual reproduction performance, and finally in annual breeding success. We analysed the effect of local weather conditions on the availability of airborne insects and on the variation in brood size and nestling condition of European bee-eaters Merops apiaster at the northern edge of their range where years with adverse weather frequently occur. The availability of large flying insects, the common prey of bee-eaters, increased with air temperatures and duration of daily sunshine. As predicted, local weather conditions affected reproductive performance with annual breeding success (mean 3.7 nestlings per breeding pair, range 1.7-4.9 nestlings) being up to 32 % higher in extraordinary dry and hot summers. Additionally, a nestling's body condition (residual mass) was also affected by sunshine duration during their growth period and internally was co-affected by the number of siblings and the individual rank within the sibling hierarchy. Thus, a prolonged duration of daily sunshine causes a cascade from higher insect flight activity, and, thus, higher food availability for chick-rearing bee-eaters, which finally translates into better chick body conditions and higher annual breeding success. Consequently reproduction and population development of European bee-eaters might be especially susceptible to regional changes in weather and climatic conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2193-7192,2193-7206,,,,JAN,2016,157,1,,,,,155,163,,10.1007/s10336-015-1262-x,,,,,,,WOS:000368610900016,,,,,

However, it also identified a summer foraging 'hotspot' in agricultural land at 2-3 km distance. Unfortunately, dance decoding does not yield precise foraging locations or information on the flower species visited. Therefore, we surveyed this hotspot during July and August 2012 and 2013 in order to identify the habitats and flower species used by honey bees and other flower-visiting insects (EVI). The hotspot area consisted predominantly of four habitat types potentially attractive to EV!: pasture fields, field margins/hedgerows of arable fields, set-aside and a National Nature Reserve. We surveyed three fields within each habitat type. The abundance of flowers was found to be a key determent of EVI abundance per field (p = 0.002). Field margins/hedgerows were the most flower abundant habitat type (p = 0.002) and had more than twice (235%) the FVI abundance (p = 0.001) and species richness (p = 0.035) per unit area than did pasture fields. Areas with long grass had greater flower abundance (p <0.001) and FVI species richness (p = 0.009) than those with short grass (<30 cm). The five plants on which we recorded the greatest number of EVI were species considered to be agricultural weeds. Honey bees represented 19% of all EVI, showing that dance decoding had located a hotspot that was an important foraging location not just for honey bees but also for other types of EVI. Honey bee abundance, per transect, was strongly correlated with that of other FVI (p = 0.001), particularly bumble bees (p <0.001). However, Mil groups were not found uniformly across our study site and honey bee abundance was only weakly linked to overall species richness (p = 0.069). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

By enhancing habitat heterogeneity and ecological connectivity, riparian buffer strips have the potential to promote insect pollinators in intensively managed landscapes. Insect pollinators and flowering plants were investigated on a range of riparian margins, and their adjacent grassland fields, to determine the main physical and botanical attributes driving pollinator diversity. Irrespective of whether they were fenced or not, riparian margins had richer plant assemblages and supported more pollinators than grassland fields. While the erection of fences did not enhance the richness or diversity of flowers, fenced riparian buffer strips supported more even and diverse assemblages of bumblebees and a greater number of butterflies than unfenced riparian margins. More bumblebees and butterflies were recorded in wide buffer strips (i.e. over 5 m wide) than in unfenced margins or narrow buffer strips (i.e. <= 3.5 m wide) and butterfly assemblages in wide buffer strips were richer and more diverse. There was a strong positive relationship between floral resources and the abundance, richness and diversity of bumblebee and butterfly assemblages. Pollinators only foraged on a small number of the flower species present and impacts of fencing and buffer strip width could not solely be attributed to the area and/or species richness of flowers. Fenced riparian buffer strips, particularly when over 5 m wide, have the potential to provide resources for insect pollinators in intensively grazed systems. Management to enhance floristic diversity (to provide a more continuous supply of pollen and nectar) and tussock forming grasses (to provide shelter for pollinators and nesting locations for bumblebees) could further increase their value to insect pollinators. In grassland systems, restricted grazing is easier to implement than mowing. It is, however, important that grazing management does not unduly interfere with other ecosystem services derived from riparian buffer strips (e.g. diffuse pollution mitigation). Widespread fencing of watercourses at the catchment level could result in the simplification of these inherently dynamic and complex habitats. Buffer strips should therefore be strategically placed to optimise benefits such as ecological connectivity and diffuse pollution mitigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the influence of landscape simplification on the composition of pollinator communities and the provisioning of pollination services to cultivated strawberry was evaluated (Fragaria x ananassa). Additionally the relative pollination efficiency for the five most common bee genera visiting strawberry flowers was measured. Pollinators were collected during bloom with pan traps on 14 commercial farms all growing the same strawberry variety in the Finger Lakes Region, NY, USA. The farms were chosen to represent a gradient in the proportion of agricultural land uses in the surrounding landscape from 0.09 to 0.60. Landscapes with greater proportions of agricultural area had lower pollinator abundances and species richness. While yield was positively correlated with pollinator abundance, species richness had little effect on the level of pollination services. This conclusion was supported by the finding that visitor identity did not explain pollination efficiency in strawberry. Our results show that a high proportion of agricultural land in the landscape negatively impacts wild pollinators and pollination services to strawberry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas parasite exposure is acknowledged as an important cause of these losses, the role of insecticides is controversial. Parasites and neonicotinoid insecticides reduce homing success of foragers (e.g. by reduced orientation), but it is unknown whether they negatively affect flight capacity. We investigated how exposing colonies to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid affect flight capacity of foragers. Flight distance, time and speed of foragers were measured in flight mills to assess the relative and interactive effects of high V. destructor load and a field-realistic, chronic sub-lethal dose of imidacloprid. Foragers from colonies exposed to high levels of V. destructor flew shorter distances, with a larger effect when also exposed to imidacloprid. Bee body mass partly explained our results as bees were heavier when exposed to these stressors, possibly due to an earlier onset of foraging. Our findings contribute to understanding of interacting stressors that can explain colony losses. Reduced flight capacity decreases the food-collecting ability of honeybees and may hamper the use of precocious foraging as a coping mechanism during colony (nutritional) stress. Ineffective coping mechanisms may lead to destructive cascading effects and subsequent colony collapse.",,,,,"van Dooremalen, Coby/0000-0002-1525-0171; Van Langevelde, Frank/0000-0001-8870-0797",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,Dec-07,2015,282,1820,,,,,,,20151738,10.1098/rspb.2015.1738,,,,,,,WOS:000368095200003,26631559,,,,

From further away flower displays jointly form larger-sized patterns within the visual scene that will guide the insect's flight. Chromatic and achromatic cues in such patterns may help insects to find, approach and learn rewarded locations in a flower patch, bringing them close enough to individual flowers.

Provision of sufficient forage resources is a key element for promoting bee populations within human impacted landscapes, particularly those in agricultural lands where demand for pollination service is high and land use and management practices have reduced available flowering resources. Recent government incentives in North America and Europe support the planting of wildflowers to benefit pollinators; surprisingly, in North America there has been almost no rigorous testing of the performance of wildflower mixes, or their ability to support wild bee abundance and diversity. We tested different wildflower mixes in a spatially replicated, multiyear study in three regions of North America where production of pollinator-dependent crops is high: Florida, Michigan, and California. In each region, we quantified flowering among wildflower mixes composed of annual and perennial species, and with high and low relative diversity. We measured the abundance and species richness of wild bees, honey bees, and syrphid flies at each mix over two seasons. In each region, some but not all wildflower mixes provided significantly greater floral display area than unmanaged weedy control plots. Mixes also attracted greater abundance and richness of wild bees, although the identity of best mixes varied among regions. By partitioning floral display size from mix identity we show the importance of display size for attracting abundant and diverse wild bees. Season-long monitoring also revealed that designing mixes to provide continuous bloom throughout the growing season is critical to supporting the greatest pollinator species richness. Contrary to expectation, perennials bloomed in their first season, and complementarity in attraction of pollinators among annuals and perennials suggests that inclusion of functionally diverse species may provide the greatest benefit. Wildflower mixes may be particularly important for providing resources for some taxa, such as bumble bees, which are known to be in decline in several regions of North America. No mix consistently attained the full diversity that was planted. Further study is needed on how to achieve the desired floral display and diversity from seed mixes.",,,,"Isaacs, Rufus/AAF-4646-2019; Ellis, James/L-7985-2013","Isaacs, Rufus/0000-0001-7523-4643; ",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,DEC,2015,25,8,,,,,2119,2131,,10.1890/14-1748.1.sm,,,,,,,WOS:000367210700005,26910943,,,,

However, it is unclear whether foragers tune their excitatory and inhibitory signalling according to food value and predation risk. We therefore studied the signals that honeybee foragers perform before and after being attacked by live predators (wasps and spiders) or a robo-predator at a nectar source. Predator attacks significantly reduced recruitment dancing and increased stop signalling, which inhibits dancing for the dangerous resource. Attack equally reduced dancing for all sucrose concentrations. However, foragers factored travel costs into their positive signalling. At the feeder with greater travel cost (100 m), bees danced less when they responded more severely to attacks. At the low travel cost feeder (1 m), there was no significant effect of attack response severity upon dancing. Attacks increased inhibitory signal production. Live and robo-predator attacks elicited 131-fold more stop signals from foragers as compared to control treatments of freshly dead predators that did not attack. However, food profitability, distance and sucrose concentration did not alter stop signalling. We suggest that this pattern may generally characterize excitatory/inhibitory signal pairs in group foraging. Foragers tune positive signalling (recruitment) to food quality and peril, and this is countered by an inhibitory signal that is tuned to danger but not resource value.

Such pressures are not expected to affect all species identically; rather, they are likely to be mediated by the species' ecological traits. Understanding which types of species are most vulnerable under which land uses is an important step towards effective conservation planning. We collated occurrence and abundance data for 257 bee species at 1584 European sites from surveys reported in 30 published papers (70056 records) and combined them with species-level ecological trait data. We used mixed-effects models to assess the importance of land use (land-use class, agricultural use-intensity and a remotely-sensed measure of vegetation), traits and traitxland-use interactions, in explaining species occurrence and abundance. Species' sensitivity to land use was most strongly influenced by flight season duration and foraging range, but also by niche breadth, reproductive strategy and phenology, with effects that differed among cropland, pastoral and urban habitats.Synthesis and applications. Rather than targeting particular species or settings, conservation actions may be more effective if focused on mitigating situations where species' traits strongly and negatively interact with land-use pressures. We find evidence that low-intensity agriculture can maintain relatively diverse bee communities; in more intensive settings, added floral resources may be beneficial, but will require careful placement with respect to foraging ranges of smaller bee species. Protection of semi-natural habitats is essential, however; in particular, conversion to urban environments could have severe effects on bee diversity and pollination services.

Besides, it should be mentioned that in the greenhouse experiment all queens were dead and most of the workers showed signs of incoordination and convulsion and gradually became apathetic. In conclusion, our results demonstrated the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin with a range of lethal and sublethal effects, both crucial for the development and survival of the B. terrestris colonies.

The nonextensive entropy is a new expansion in statistical mechanics, and it is a recent formalism in which a real quantity q was introduced as parameter for physical systems that presents the long range interactions, long time memories and fractal-type structures. The feasibility of the proposed cuckoo search and Tsallis entropy based approach was tested on 10 different satellite images and benchmarked with differential evolution, wind driven optimization, particle swarm optimization and artificial bee colony algorithm for solving the multilevel colored image thresholding problems. Experiments have been conducted on a variety of satellite images. Several measurements are used to evaluate the performance of proposed method which clearly illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

Recent concerns about the declines of both domestic and wild bees, calls for measures to promote wild pollinator populations in farmland. However, to be able to efficiently promote and prioritize between measures that benefit pollinators, such as modified land use, agri-environment schemes, or specific conservation measures, it is important to have a tool that accurately predicts how bees use landscapes and respond to such measures. In this paper we compare an existing model for predicting pollination (the ""Lonsdorf model""), with an extension of a general model for habitat use of central place foragers (the ""CPF model""). The Lonsdorf model has been shown to perform relatively well in simple landscapes, but not in complex landscapes. We hypothesized that this was because it lacks a behavioral component, assuming instead that bees in essence diffuse out from the nest into the landscape. By adding a behavioral component, the CPF model in contrast assumes that bees only use those parts of the landscape that enhances their fitness, completely avoiding foraging in other parts of the landscape. Because foraging is directed toward the most rewarding foraging habitat patches as determined by quality and distance, foraging habitat will include a wide range of forage qualities close to the nest, but a much narrower range farther away. We generate predictions for both simple and complex hypothetical landscapes, to illustrate the effect of including the behavioral rule, and for real landscapes. In the real landscapes the models give similar predictions for visitation rates in simple landscapes, but more different predictions in heterogeneous landscapes. We also analyze the consequences of introducing hedgerows near a mass-flowering crop field under each model. The Lonsdorf model predicts that any habitat improvement will enhance pollination of the crop. In contrast, the CPF model predicts that the hedgerow must provide good nesting sites, and not just foraging opportunities, for it to benefit pollination of the crop, because good forage quality alone may drain bees away from the field. Our model can be used to optimize pollinator mitigation measures in real landscapes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Its inclusion in the experimental tool kit of behavioural ecologists is much more recent. These recent studies have certainly paid off. They have shown that, for an organism that lacks a brain or central nervous system, P. polycephalum shows rather complex behaviour. For example, it is capable of finding the shortest path through a maze, it can construct networks as efficient as those designed by humans, it can solve computationally difficult puzzles, it makes multi-objective foraging decisions, it balances its nutrient intake and it even behaves irrationally.

Two study areas were employed: a pollen donor area composed of a clonal stand of a single pollen donor clone (PD) and a pollen sink (PS) area composed of a mixed clonal stand of two other clones (PSI and PS2). In the pollen sink area four plots with 30 trees each, located at 25, 200, 400 and 550 m from the PD were established as sink islands. Before flowering, the entire clonal stands of clones PSI and PS2, with exception of the sink islands were clear cut. Seeds were harvested from five randomly sampled trees in each sink island and the paternity of 15 seedlings per tree, 75 seedlings per island totaling a sample of 300 seedlings, was determined with PD as the alleged father. The self-pollination rate in the sink islands varied from zero to 24%. Paternity assignment to the PD was highest in the island at 25 m (17.3%) and rapidly decreased to 4.0% at 200 m and 2.7% at 550 m, suggesting a pattern of isolation by distance, while revealing a large pollen contribution from unaccounted sources across all islands. Our results in a fragmented clonal site agree with previous estimates of general pollen movement in eucalypt seed orchards, showing that pollination will take place by and large at relatively short distances of less than 200 m, consistent with the expected range of flight of pollinator bees. Nevertheless the exponential distribution observed also indicates that low levels of pollination success are to be expected over longer distances. Our data provide useful guidelines regarding the distance at which seed orchards should be established away from potentially large pollen pressure of clonal stands to minimize unwanted pollen introgression. Furthermore, our results on dispersal rate and distance of pollen have direct implications on gene containment strategies and modeling studies, as pollen-mediated gene flow is one of the key determinants of the potential ecological and biosafety impacts of prospective transgenic eucalypts.

We examined one neonicotinoid pesticide, imidacloprid, for its effects on the foraging behavior of free-flying honey bees (Apis mellifera anatoliaca) visiting artificial blue and white flowers. Imidacloprid doses, ranging from 1/5 to 1/50 of the reported LD50, were fed to bees orally. The study consisted of three experimental parts performed sequentially without interruption. In Part 1, both flower colors contained a 4 mu L 1 M sucrose solution reward. Part 2 offered bees 4 mu L of 1.5 M sucrose solution in blue flowers and a 4 mu L 0.5 M sucrose solution reward in white flowers. In Part 3 we reversed the sugar solution rewards, while keeping the flower color consistent. Each experiment began 30 min after administration of the pesticide. We recorded the percentage of experimental bees that returned to forage after treatment. We also recorded the visitation rate, number of flowers visited, and floral reward choices of the bees that foraged after treatment. The forager return rate declined linearly with increasing imidacloprid dose. The number of foraging trips by returning bees was also affected adversely. However, flower fidelity was not affected by imidacloprid dose. Foragers visited both blue and white flowers extensively in Part 1, and showed greater fidelity for the flower color offering the higher sugar solution reward in Parts 2 and 3. Although larger samples sizes are needed, our study suggests that imidacloprid may not affect the ability to select the higher nectar reward when rewards were reversed.

They use visual memories of the surrounding scene and probably compass information to control their direction. Do they also remember the length of their route and do they link memories of direction and distance? To answer these questions, we trained wood ant (Formica rufa) foragers in a channel to perform either a single short foraging route or two foraging routes in opposite directions. By shifting the starting position of the route within the channel, but keeping the direction and distance fixed, we tried to ensure that the ants would rely upon vector memories rather than visual memories to decide when to stop. The homeward memories that the ants formed were revealed by placing fed or unfed ants directly into a channel and assessing the direction and distance that they walked without prior performance of the food-ward leg of the journey. This procedure prevented the distance and direction walked being affected by a home vector derived from path integration. Ants that were unfed walked in the feeder direction. Fed ants walked in the opposite direction for a distance related to the separation between start and feeder. Vector memories of a return route can thus be primed by the ants' feeding state and expressed even when the ants have not performed the food-ward route. Tests on ants that have acquired two routes indicate that memories of the direction and distance of the return routes are linked, suggesting that they may be encoded by a common neural population within the ant brain.",,,,"Philippides, Andrew/E-7240-2010","Philippides, Andrew/0000-0001-5503-0467",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,NOV,2015,218,22,,,,,3580,3588,,10.1242/jeb.125443,,,,,,,WOS:000365342100011,26417013,,,,

We employed high-accuracy mass-spectrometry-based proteomics to survey phosphoproteome changes in the newly emerged, nurse, and forager bees. Overall, 941, 1322, and 1196 phosphorylation sites matching 1007, 1353, and 1199 phosphopeptides from 549, 720, and 698 phosphoproteins were identified in the three ages of the HG, respectively. Specialized, interconnected phosphorylation networks within each age were found by comparing protein abundance and phosphorylation levels. This illustrates that many proteins are regulated by phosphorylation independent of their expression levels. Furthermore, proteins in key biological processes and pathways were dynamically phosphorylated with age development, including the centrosome cycle, mitotic spindle elongation, macromolecular complex disassembly, and ribosome, indicating that phosphorylation tunes protein activity to optimize cellular behavior of the HG over time. Moreover, complementary protein and phosphoprotein expression is required to support the unique physiology of secretory activity in the HG.

The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Native to Britain, O. sphegodes used to be more widely distributed throughout south-eastern England, but is now mainly restricted to the counties of Dorset, East Sussex and Kent. It is widespread throughout the western parts of central and southern Europe, and is common in Spain, France and Italy. Further east, it occurs in Bulgaria and Greece, including most of the Mediterranean islands, and extends into southern Russia, Turkey and northern Iran.Ophrys sphegodes grows on calcareous, nutrient-poor substrates and rarely under any shade. It is most common in ancient, heavily grazed grassland on chalk and Jurassic limestone, but it also occurs in disturbed habitats, horizontally oriented rock floors in limestone quarries, on old limestone quarry spoil heaps, and in lightly trampled calcareous grasslands on maritime cliffs.Ophrys sphegodes multiplies predominantly by sexual reproduction. Vegetative multiplication occasionally occurs through survival or splitting of the old tuber. In the UK, the species is almost exclusively pollinated by males of the solitary bee Andrena nigroaenea. Male bees are attracted by complex floral bouquets emitted by the flowers that strongly resemble pheromones produced by female A.nigroaenea. Fruit production is generally low, and in most populations, <15% of the flowers produce capsules.Ophrys sphegodes is reproductively isolated from other species in the genus by strong pre-mating barriers, most notably temporal (differences in flowering time) and floral (different pollinators) isolation. In particular, differences in floral odour appear to underlie floral isolation. Nonetheless, several hybrids involving O.sphegodes have been described in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. The range of O.sphegodes in Britain declined dramatically in the twentieth century, leading to its extinction in twelve vice-counties. Losses were mainly due to ploughing of grassland and changes in fertilizer and grazing regimes. Its range has increased somewhat in recent years. However, increases in spring temperature due to climate warming may seriously threaten the species in Britain by disrupting the close relationship between O.sphegodes flowering time and the phenology of flight of its prime pollinator, leading to reproductive failure.",,,,"Jacquemyn, Hans/AAC-4875-2019","Jacquemyn, Hans/0000-0001-9600-5794",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,NOV,2015,103,6,,,,,1680,1696,,10.1111/1365-2745.12469,,,,,,,WOS:000363339300029,,,,,

Hope",,,Distinct types of foragers in the ant Ectatomma ruidum: typical foragers and furtive thieves,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,,,,,,,,,,,,"A principal benefit of social living is the communal defence of resources. However, in the ant Ectatomma ruidum, specialized thieves often circumvent detection by conspecific non-nestmates, and those detected are peacefully expelled. Colonies can gather food through typical foraging (opportunistically tracking prey or nutrients in the home range) or by robbing (entering a conspecific nest, waiting for, and then removing a newly arrived food item carried in by a forager). Here, we conducted behavioural assays to determine whether robbers (or 'thieves'), carrying purloined food, manifest behaviours that minimize the probability of detection relative to nonthieving individuals. We found several lines of evidence that individuals carrying stolen food behave distinctly from normal nonthieving foragers. When returning to their home nest with a stolen food item, thieves had fewer encounters with conspecifics, were more likely to pause during movement, and were more likely to release food when grasped. Thieves walked faster while travelling in the victim's home range, compared to their own home range. When experimentally perturbed, thieves were more likely to reverse their direction of movement, while normal foragers continued moving in the same direction. Because the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition, as well as the C:N ratio, was the same for both thieves and nonthieves, we conclude that both groups were accessing the same food sources, using different behaviours to repartition a common resource. We conclude that, although thieves are morphologically indistinguishable from nonthieving foragers, their food retrieval behaviours are distinct in a manner that reduces the probability of detection and aggressive interactions with other conspecifics. We propose that thieves are a distinct caste of forager in E. ruidum. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Studies show negative correlations between flower visitation of honey bees (Apis mellifera) and wild bees, but effects on the reproduction of wild bees were not proven. Likely reasons are that honey bees can hardly be excluded from controls and wild bee nests are generally difficult to detect in field experiments. The goal of this study was to investigate whether red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) compete with honey bees in cages in order to compare the reproduction of red mason bees under different honey bee densities. Three treatments were applied, each replicated in four cages of 18m(3) with 38 red mason bees in all treatments and 0, 100, and 300 honey bees per treatment with 10-20% being foragers. Within the cages, the flower visitation and interspecific displacements from flowers were observed. Niche breadths and resource overlaps of both bee species were calculated, and the reproduction of red mason bees was measured. Red mason bees visited fewer flowers when honey bees were present. Niche breadth of red mason bees decreased with increasing honey bee density while resource overlaps remained constant. The reproduction of red mason bees decreased in cages with honey bees.

However, genetic diversity may not vary with stand size because insufficient time has passed since stands were established or pollen and propagule dispersal are sufficient to overwhelm the effects of genetic drift and founder events. We tested the predictions that, despite the potential of mangroves for dispersal of propagules by water and long distance dispersal of pollen by honeybees, fragmentation and localized foraging by honeybees causes small stands of A. marina to display reduced genetic diversity and elevated inbreeding. Using four microsatellite markers, we quantified the genetic and genotypic diversity present within samples of 20 adults taken from three large (> 1500 trees), intermediate (300-500 trees) and small (< 50 trees) stands within each of two urbanized estuaries and estimated mating system parameters using progeny arrays for sets of five adults within the large and small stands. We detected no significant effect of stand size on levels of single-locus genetic diversity.

This ""honey at departure"" is used as a material to build pollen loads (glue honey) as well as fuel during flight in pollen foragers. We investigated the relationship between the size of pollen loads that a forager collected and the amount of honey at departure in the Western honeybee, Apis mellifera. Dancing pollen foragers increased honey at departure with the size of collected pollen loads. Analysis of the waggle-run duration revealed that the size of pollen load affected the rate of increase of honey at departure with food source distance in dancers. The increase rate was significantly higher in dancers that had returned to the hive with large pollen loads versus nectar-collecting dancers, but not in those with smaller pollen loads. The higher increase rate may reflect additional fuel carried for the return trip in pollen-foraging specialists that do not use collected nectar as fuel. Although honey carried by departing dance followers also increased significantly with the size of pollen load carried by dancers, the adjustment was different from that of dancers. These results suggest that recruited bees adjust the amount of honey at departure, including glue honey, based on communicated information and modify the amount of honey load subsequently based on their own experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0020-1812,1420-9098,,,,NOV,2015,62,4,,,,,497,505,,10.1007/s00040-015-0429-z,,,,,,,WOS:000361496300014,,,,,

Artificial water bodies, open urban areas, large industrial facilities including heavy industry, railways and associated installations, buildings and installations with socio-cultural purpose, camping-, sports-, playgrounds, golf courts, oilseed crops other than oilseed rape like sunflower or linseed, some spring cereals and former forest clearcuts or windthrows were the land cover classes most frequently associated with high honey bee colony losses. Grain maize, mixed forest and mixed coniferous forest were the land cover classes most frequently associated with low honey bee colony losses. The present data suggest that land covers related to transport, industry and leisure may have made a more substantial contribution to winter honey bee colony losses in developed countries than anticipated so far.

Species communities of calcareous grasslands, which are among Europe's most diverse habitats, are severely threatened by the cessation of appropriate traditional management, loss of habitat connectivity and simplification of the surrounding landscape. However, our understanding of these often interrelated factors remains limited, in particular for trait-mediated responses across taxa. Here, we test the independent effects of local management (grazing, mowing and abandonment), habitat connectivity (measured by a connectivity index) and landscape complexity (indicated by the percentage of arable land) on nine taxa: plants, butterflies, bees, grasshoppers, hoverflies, spiders, true bugs, rove beetles and leafhoppers on small semi-natural calcareous grassland remnants (<1ha). LocationCentral Germany. MethodsWe use a joint analysis across taxa to identify general and trait-mediated responses (body size and Red List status) in species richness, abundance and community composition. ResultsWe identified three key drivers of local diversity patterns: First, an increasing proportion of arable land from 10% to 80% led to a 29% loss of overall species richness. Second, despite differences between taxa, increasing habitat connectivity generally enhanced species richness. Connectivity effects were more accentuated in the large species per taxon, which can be expected to be good dispersers. Finally, grazing reduced species richness and abundance much more than annual mowing or short-term abandonment (5-15years), in particular for red-listed species. We attribute this to plant resource removal through overgrazing and trampling. Main conclusionsFor the conservation management of small calcareous grasslands, we advocate an alternating strategy of mowing or lenient grazing and short-term abandonment, prioritizing connected fragments surrounded by diverse landscapes.

In pollinator-dependent crops, pesticides may reduce bee populations, creating trade-offs between pest management and crop pollination. In this three-year study, we examined the effects of pesticides on the abundance and species richness of wild bees within apple orchards of southern Wisconsin. We additionally deployed colonies of Bombus impatiens, a native and common species, in order to relate colony performance to orchard pesticide use. Utilizing grower spray records, we developed ""toxicity scores"" as a continuous index of pesticide use for each orchard, a measure that incorporated each pesticide's relative toxicity to bees, its residual activity, and its application rate. While there was no relationship between total wild bee abundance and species richness with toxicity scores, there was a significant, negative effect on sweat bees, Lasioglossum spp. Many of these sweat bees are small-bodied, have short foraging ranges, are social, and have long foraging periods, all traits that could increase bee exposure or sensitivity to orchard pesticides. In addition, sentinel bumble bee colonies at orchards with high toxicity scores produced fewer, and smaller, workers. Bumble bees may also have a greater sensitivity and exposure to orchard pesticides due to their sociality and long foraging periods.

In eusocial species, P450 expression varies with anatomy and age-related behaviour. Adult honeybees (Apis mellifera) possess appendages differentially equipped for chemoreception; antennae and prothoracic and mesothoracic legs assess food and pheromone signals whereas metathoracic legs transport pollen over long distances. Newly eclosed bees and nurses remain in the hive and neither gather nor process food, whereas foragers collect pollen and nectar, thereby encountering phytochemicals. To understand the functions of cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily G, polypeptide 11 (CYP4G11) in the honeybee genome, we compared its expression relative to worker age and task to expression of cytochrome P450, family 9, subfamily Q, polypeptides (CYP9Qs) known to metabolize xenobiotics. That CYP4G11 is highly expressed in forager antennae and legs, with highest expression in prothoracic and mesothoracic legs, is consistent with chemosensory perception, whereas weak expression of CYP4G11 in nurses suggests that it may process primarily exogenous rather than endogenous chemical signals. By contrast, and consistent with xenobiotic detoxification, the three CYP9Q transcripts were almost undetectable in newly eclosed workers and highest in foragers, with maximal expression in the metathoracic legs that closely contact pollen phytochemicals.

The proposed methodology is developed on the basics of a new swarm based Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm combined with two-step constrained local search for neighborhood selection. VRPSTW involves computing the routes of a set of vehicles with fixed capacity from a central depot to a set of geographically dispersed customers with known demands and predefined time windows. Here, the time window constraints are relaxed into ""soft"", that is penalty terms are added to the solution cost whenever a vehicle serves a customer outside of his time window. The solution of routing problems with soft time windows has valuable practical applications. This paper uses a direct interpretation of the VRPSTW as a multi-objective optimization problem where the total traveling distance, number of window violations and number of required vehicles are minimized while capacity and time window constraints are met. Our work aims at using ABC inspired foraging behavior of honey bees which balances exploration and exploitation to avoid local optima and reach the global optima. The algorithm is applied to solve the well known benchmark Solomon's problem instances. Experimental results show that our suggested approach is quite effective, as it provides solutions that are competitive with the best known results in the literature.

Previous reports concerning C. megacephala eye properties did not include measurements of body size, making the relationship between the specialized eye region and body size unclear. We examined different morphological features of the eye among individuals of varying sizes. We found total eye size scaled proportionately to body size, but the number of enlarged dorsal facets increased as body size increased. This demonstrated that larger males have an eye that is morphologically different than smaller males. On the basis of external morphology, we hypothesized that since larger males have larger and a greater number of dorsally enlarged facets, and these facets are believed to allow for increased light capture, larger males would be active in lower light levels than smaller males and females of equal size. In a laboratory setting, larger males were observed to become active earlier in the morning than smaller males, although they did not remain active later in the evening.

Head orientation is stabilized for most of the time by counter rotation. Here, we use high-speed video to analyse head-and body-movements of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris while approaching and departing from a food source located between three landmarks in an indoor flight-arena. The flight paths consist of almost straight flight segments that are interspersed with rapid turns. These short and fast yaw turns (""saccades"") are usually accompanied by even faster head yaw turns that change gaze direction. Since a large part of image rotation is thereby reduced to brief instants of time, this behavioural pattern facilitates depth perception from visual motion parallax during the intersaccadic intervals. The detailed analysis of the fine structure of the bees' head turning movements shows that the time course of single head saccades is very stereotypical. We find a consistent relationship between the duration, peak velocity and amplitude of saccadic head movements, which in its main characteristics resembles the so-called ""saccadic main sequence"" in humans. The fact that bumblebee head saccades are highly stereotyped as in humans, may hint at a common principle, where fast and precise motor control is used to reliably reduce the time during which the retinal images moves.",,,,"Egelhaaf, Martin/A-9824-2010","Egelhaaf, Martin/0000-0002-9336-4270",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Sep-09,2015,10,9,,,,,,,e0135020,10.1371/journal.pone.0135020,,,,,,,WOS:000360932800005,26352836,,,,

While its contribution to economic development and watershed protection is increasingly recognized its cultural significance is however, seldom noticed. This study was conducted using an ethnobotanical study approach to document the honey bee flora and associated indigenous knowledge of local communities in Borena Sayint National Park (BSNP), north eastern Ethiopia. Methods: Data were collected from 170 informants through semi-structured interviews and guided field walks, focus group discussion with 37 informants and 14 key informants and analyzed using standard analytical tools including ranking, comparisons and multivariate analyses. Results: In total, 152 bee forage species in 133 genera and 74 families were documented. The Asteraceae and Rosaceae were represented with six species each over the other plant families. Percentage of mentions per species ranged between 76.9 and 13.5 % for the most salient bee forage species. Dombeya torrida, Erica arborea, and Olinia rochetiana captured high community consensus as measured by rank order of popularity and designated as local appellation names of honey. Cluster analysis of priority ranking data showed relationships between key informants with respect to preferences, but ordination analysis did not indicate environmental proximity as a determinant of their responses. Five honey harvesting seasons occur each corresponding to the floral calendar of a dominant bee forage species that stipulate relocation of hives to appropriate locations within the national park.

As social insects, they have to detect and cope with thermal fluctuations not only for their individual benefit but also for the developmental benefit of the colony and its brood. In this study we investigate the sensory basis for the fine-tuned, temperature guided behaviors found in ants, specifically what information about their thermal environment they can assess. We describe the dose response curves of two cold sensitive neurons, associated with the sensillum coelocapitulum on the antenna of the carpenter ant Camponotus rufipes. One cold-sensitive neuron codes for temperature changes, thus functioning as a thermal flux detector. Neurons of such type continuously provide the ant with information about temperature transients (T T-neuron). The TT-neurons are able to resolve a relative change of 37% in stimulus intensity (Delta T) and antennal scanning of the thermal environment may aid the ant's ability to use temperature differences for orientation. The second cold sensitive neuron in the S. coelocapitulum responds to temperature only within a narrow temperature range. A temperature difference of 1.6 degrees C can be resolved by this neuron type. Since the working range matches the preferred temperature range for brood care of Camponotus rufipes, we hypothesize that this temperature sensor can function as a thermal switch to trigger brood care behavior, based on absolute (steady state) temperature.",,,,"Nagel, Manuel/Q-9283-2017; Kleineidam, Christoph J/A-6529-2009","Nagel, Manuel/0000-0001-9820-5546; Kleineidam, Christoph J/0000-0003-0671-1455",,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5153,,,,,Sep-03,2015,9,,,,,,,,240,10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00240,,,,,,,WOS:000361229900001,26388753,,,,

However, some pollinators can visit flowers before full opening and contribute to fruit and seed sets. In this paper, we researched the pollination biology of flowers just starting to open in four field experiments. We observed the insect visitors to Lycoris sanguinea var. sanguinea for 3 years at five sites. These observations revealed that only small bees, Lasioglossum japonicum, often entered through tiny spaces between the tepals of 'breaking buds' (i.e. partially opened flowers) and collected pollen. We hypothesized that they can pollinate this species at the breaking-bud stage, when the stigma is located near the anthers. To measure the pollination effect of small bees at the breaking-bud stage, we bagged several breaking buds after small bees had visited them and examined whether these buds were pollinated. In bagging experiments, 30 % of the breaking buds set fruit and seeds. Fruit-set ratios of the breaking buds did not differ significantly from those of the fully opened flowers, which had been visited by several insect species. We also counted the pollen grain numbers on the body of L. japonicum and on the anthers of randomly-selected and manipulated flowers. These experiments revealed that all of the captured bees had some pollen of target plants and that L. japonicum collected most of the pollen grains at the breaking-bud stage. Our results showed that the new pollination process, breaking-bud pollination, happened in breaking buds by L. japonicum, although there is no evidence to reveal that this is the most effective pollination method for L. sanguinea var. sanguinea. In principle, this new pollination process can occur in other flowering plants and our results are a major contribution to studies of plant-pollinator interactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0918-9440,1618-0860,,,,SEP,2015,128,5,,,,,803,811,,10.1007/s10265-015-0741-8,,,,,,,WOS:000360372700007,26175010,,,,

The operation of this inherited program is shaped by selective pressures acting on its efficiency, which is largely dependent upon the way the system handles sensory information. Flowers offer a wealth of signals, from odors acting as distant attractants, to colors eliciting approximation and feeding responses, to textures guiding feeding responses toward a reservoir of nectar. Thus, animals use different signals in the regulation of particular motor outputs. Nevertheless, the use of these sensory signals can be user-specific (e.g. species, motivation, experience, learning) as well as context-dependent (e.g. spatiotemporal patterns of stimulation, availability of signals, multimodal integration). The crepuscular/nocturnal hawkmoths Manduca sexta experience a wide range of illuminations during their foraging activity, which raises the question of how these environmental changes might affect the use of two important floral signals, odor and visual display. In a flight cage, we explored the use of these signals under different illuminances. Under conditions of starlight and crescent moonlight, moths showed very low levels of responsiveness to unscented feeders (artificial flowers). However, responsiveness was recovered either by increasing illumination, or by offering olfactory signals. Additionally, we recorded a bias toward white over blue feeders under dim conditions, which disappeared with increasing illumination. We discuss how this kind of experimental manipulation may provide insights to the study of how innate behavioral programs, and their underlying neural substrates, overcome selective forces imposed by the uncertainty of natural, ever-changing environments.",,,,,"Yuan, Michael/0000-0002-0298-0781",,,,,,,,,,,,1540-7063,1557-7023,,,,SEP,2015,55,3,,,,,486,494,,10.1093/icb/icv009,,,,,,,WOS:000360006000013,25857525,,,,

Random mating or panmixis is a fundamental assumption in quantitative genetic theory. Random mating is sometimes thought to occur in actual fact, although a large body of empirical work shows that this is often not the case in nature. Models have been developed to explain many non-random mating phenomena. This paper measured pollen-parent fecundity distributions among outbred perennial forage legume species [autotetraploid alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), autohexaploid kura clover (Trifolium ambiguum M. Bieb.), and diploid red clover (Trifolium pratense L.)] in ten polycrosses ranging in size (N) from 9 to 94 pollinated with bee pollinators [Bumble Bees (Bombus impatiens Cr.) and leafcutter bees (Megachile rotundata F.)]. A Weibull distribution best fit the observed pollen-parent fecundity distributions. After standardizing data among the 10 polycrosses, a single Weibull distribution-based model was obtained with an R (2) of 0.978. The model is able to predict pollen-parent fecundity distributions based on polycross size alone. The model predicts that the effective polycross size will be approximately 9 % smaller than under random mating (i.e., N (e)/N similar to 0.91). The model is simple and can easily be incorporated into other models or simulations requiring a pollen-parent fecundity distribution. Further work is needed to determine how widely applicable the model is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0040-5752,1432-2242,,,,SEP,2015,128,9,,,,,1865,1879,,10.1007/s00122-015-2553-6,,,,,,,WOS:000359835800017,26105686,,,,

Presented here is the design, development, and analysis of a novel biosurfactant protein we call Surfactant Resisting Foam formatioN (SRFN). Starting with the Tungara frog's foam forming protein Ranaspumin-2, we have engineered a new surfactant protein with a destabilized hinge region to alter the kinetics and equilibrium of the protein structural transition from aqueous globular form to an extended surfactant structure at the air/water interface. SRFN is capable of approximately the same total surface tension reduction, but with the unique property of forming quickly collapsible foams. The difference in foam formation is attributed to the destabilizing glycine substitutions engineered into the hinge region. Surfactants used specifically to increase wettability, such as those used in agricultural applications would benefit from this new proteosurfactant since foamed liquid has greater wind resistance and decreased dispersal. Indeed, given growing concern of organsilicone surfactant effects on declining bee populations, biological surfactant proteins have several unique advantages over more common amphiphiles in that they can be renewably sourced, are environmentally friendly, degrade readily into non-toxic byproducts, and reduce surface tension without deleterious effects on cell membranes.

Here, the impact of three reduced-risk insecticides - azadirachtin, spinosad and chlorantraniliprole - was assessed in two species of stingless bees, Partamona helleri and Scaptotrigona xanthotrica, which are important native pollinators in Neotropical America. The neonicotinoid imidacloprid was used as a positive control. Spinosad exhibited high oral and contact toxicities in adult workers of both species at the recommended label rates, with median survival times (LT(50)s) ranging from 1 to 4 h, whereas these estimates were below 15 min for imidacloprid. Azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole exhibited low toxicity at the recommended label rates, with negligible mortality that did not allow LT50 estimation. Sublethal behavioural assessments of these two insecticides indicated that neither one of them affected the overall group activity of workers of the two species. However, both azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole impaired individual flight take-off of P. helleri and S. xanthotrica worker bees, which may compromise foraging activity, potentially leading to reduced colony survival.

These include pollinating insects such as bumblebees, for which positive effects of AES on abundance and species richness have been shown. However, there is a lack of evidence for effects of AES on reproduction of target species, at either local or landscape scales, We conducted a large-scale study across landscapes exhibiting a gradient of agricultural intensity to investigate the effects of a targeted flower mixture, sown in patches of three different sizes, on an index of the total biomass of bumblebee sexuals (males and queens) on replicated transects within each landscape. We used this index (MQ) as a measure of bumblebee reproduction. After controlling for floral density on transects, we found that MQ was significantly higher on sown flower patches than on conventionally managed control patches at local scales throughout the three-year study. While sown flower patches did not significantly increase MQ in surrounding landscapes, MQ was higher in landscapes surrounding larger (I ha) than smaller (0.25 ha) sown patches. Our results suggest that, while responses of different bee species may vary depending on the plant species sown, targeted flower mixtures can enhance bumblebee reproduction by providing locally attractive forage resources to bumblebees of all castes and sexes from nests within foraging distance. If established at large enough scales, sown flower patches may lead to a detectable spill-over of reproductives into surrounding landscapes. Furthermore, effects of sown patches on MQ were moderated by landscape context, the strongest positive responses being detected at sites with high proportions of arable land. This supports previous findings that AES can deliver greater net benefits for pollinators in more intensively farmed landscapes.",,,,"Osborne, Juliet/I-6776-2012; Bourke, Andrew/E-5271-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,1439-1791,1618-0089,,,,SEP,2015,16,6,,,,,519,530,,10.1016/j.baae.2015.05.006,,,,,,,WOS:000360713200006,,,,,

We synthesize these three lines of research, to underline the mechanisms driving these patterns and create a conceptual model for recursive movement behavior across species and spatio-temporal scales. The emergence and complexity of recursive movement patterns are determined by the rate of resource recovery, environmental heterogeneity, the predictability of resource recovery, and the animal's cognitive capabilities.

We compared melissopalynology, where pollen grains retrieved from honey are identified morphologically, with a DNA metabarcoding approach using the rbcL DNA barcode marker and 454-pyrosequencing. We compared nine honeys supplied by beekeepers in the UK. DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology were able to detect the most abundant floral components of honey. There was 92% correspondence for the plant taxa that had an abundance of over 20%. However, the level of similarity when all taxa were compared was lower, ranging from 22-45%, and there was little correspondence between the relative abundance of taxa found using the two techniques. DNA metabarcoding provided much greater repeatability, with a 64% taxa match compared to 28% with melissopalynology. DNA metabarcoding has the advantage over melissopalynology in that it does not require a high level of taxonomic expertise, a greater sample size can be screened and it provides greater resolution for some plant families. However, it does not provide a quantitative approach and pollen present in low levels are less likely to be detected. We investigated the plants that were frequently used by honey bees by examining the results obtained from both techniques. Plants with a broad taxonomic range were detected, covering 46 families and 25 orders, but a relatively small number of plants were consistently seen across multiple honey samples. Frequently found herbaceous species were Rubus fruticosus, Filipendula ulmaria, Taraxacum officinale, Trifolium spp., Brassica spp. and the non-native, invasive, Impatiens glandulifera. Tree pollen was frequently seen belonging to Castanea sativa, Crataegus monogyna and species of Malus, Salix and Quercus. We conclude that although honey bees are considered to be supergeneralists in their foraging choices, there are certain key species or plant groups that are particularly important in the honey bees environment. The reasons for this require further investigation in order to better understand honey bee nutritional requirements. DNA metabarcoding can be easily and widely used to investigate floral visitation in honey bees and can be adapted for use with other insects. It provides a starting point for investigating how we can better provide for the insects that we rely upon for pollination.",,,,"Baillie, Les/AAG-7090-2020","de Vere, Natasha/0000-0001-9593-6925; Baillie, Les/0000-0002-8186-223X",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Aug-26,2015,10,8,,,,,,,e0134735,10.1371/journal.pone.0134735,,,,,,,WOS:000360069400035,26308362,,,,

Here we report an experiment using the plant Antirrhinum majus and the bumblebee Bombus terrestris to investigate how prior learning experience may affect pollinator preferences between floral types when these are presented together. We trained naive bumblebees to forage freely on flowering individuals of either A. majus pseudomajus (magenta flowers) or A. majus striatum (yellow flowers) in a flight cage. We then used a Y-maze device to expose trained bumblebees to a dual choice between the floral types. We tested the influence of training on their choice, depending on the type of plant signals available (visual signals, olfactory signals, or both). Bumblebees had no innate preference for either subspecies. Bumblebees trained on the yellow-flowered subspecies later preferred the yellow type, even when only visual or only olfactory signals were available, and their preference was not reinforced when both signal types were available. In contrast, bumblebees trained on the magenta-flowered subspecies showed no further preference between floral types and took slightly more time to make their choice. Since pollinator constancy has been observed in wild populations of A. majus with mixed floral types, we suggest that such constancy likely relies on short-term memory rather than acquired preference through long-term memory induced by prior learning.",,,,"Thebaud, Christophe/N-3916-2016; Raynaud, Christine/Q-7648-2019; Simon, Valerie/L-8655-2013","Thebaud, Christophe/0000-0002-8586-1234; Simon, Valerie/0000-0002-2624-157X; Raynaud, Christine/0000-0001-7913-6653; Jaworski, Coline/0000-0002-6136-8656",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Aug-11,2015,10,8,,,,,,,e0130225,10.1371/journal.pone.0130225,,,,,,,WOS:000359353300003,26263186,,,,

We studied how regional and local differences affect the spatial distribution of wild bee species richness, activity-density and body size in crop fields. We sampled bees both from the field centre and at two different types of semi-natural field margins, grass strips and hedges, in 12 strawberry fields. The fields were distributed over four regions in Northern Europe, representing an almost 1100 km long north-south gradient. Even over this gradient, daytime temperatures during sampling did not differ significantly between regions and did therefore probably not impact bee activity. Bee species richness was higher in field margins compared with field centres independent of field size. However, there was no difference between centre and margin in body-size or activity-density. In contrast, bee activity-density increased towards the southern regions, whereas the mean body size increased towards the north. In conclusion, our study revealed a general pattern across European regions of bee diversity, but not activity-density, declining towards the field interior which suggests that the benefits of functional diversity of pollinators may be difficult to achieve through spillover effects from margins to crop.

Here, we present a modified version of determinism (DET) from recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) as a standard metric for quantifying sequential behaviors. We focus on a case study of trapline foraging, a taxonomically widespread behavioral strategy in which animals repeatedly visit spatially fixed resources in a predictable order. Using a bumble bee movement dataset, we demonstrate how to calculate DET and create and interpret recurrence plots, which visually demonstrate patterns in foraging sequences. We show a new method for statistical comparisons of DET scores and assess the sensitivity of DET to resource density using simulated foraging sequences. We find that DET complements and offers distinct advantages over previously available methods for many questions and datasets since it does not depend on any particular resource arrangement or experimental setup and is relatively insensitive to resource density.

Social behavior in this temperate South American species is characterized by: a solitary nest initiation phase, followed by an eusocial phase with at least two broods; the small size of the colonies, with 1-3 first-brood females during the summer foraging period; the long-lived foundresses, alive until the end of the season; lack of morphological differentiation between dominant and subordinate individuals, evidenced by size only, but strong physiological differentiation, with a high reproductive skew; short egg-to-adult developmental time (approximately 30 days); and delayed male production to the second or subsequent broods.

The introduction of livestock in natural areas is a common disturbance that affects both plant and pollinator diversity and might affect their interaction. Understanding whether livestock affect a food resource for pollinators (i.e. flower abundance) and/or a pollinator assemblage (i.e. abundance and richness) has important implications for plant-pollinator interactions and still needs deeper investigation. 2. This study investigated how pollinator communities and flower abundance determined floral visitation frequency along a grazing gradient, using seven large paddocks in Patagonian Monte Desert that varied in livestock densities. Pollinator visitation frequency was measured in five of the most abundant native plant species of the region, present in all the paddocks, but that differed in reproductive strategy ranging from insect-pollinated self-compatible and self-incompatible to wind-pollinated. The influence of livestock density, insect, and flower abundance on visitation frequency was evaluated using D-separation hierarchical path models. 3. Intermediate stocking densities showed the highest insect richness and abundance. Livestock density showed a negative quadratic relationship with insect richness; hymenopterans being the main insect group in the region. Flower density decreased with the increase in livestock density. The five plant species shared several pollinator species although each one supported a distinct assemblage. 4. The path model showed that livestock was not directly associated with pollinator visitation frequency; however, this apparent lack of association was as a result of opposite forces acting together. An increase in livestock density reduced visitation frequency through a decrease in insect abundance, yet, livestock simultaneously increased the pollinator visitation rate through decreased flower abundance. 5. This study describes how changes in the density of exotic mammals can affect pollinator and flower abundance, resulting in contrasting effects on flower visitation rates with, apparently, neutral net consequences. This illustrates the complexity of responses to plant-pollinator interactions to anthropogenic disturbances that alter the ecological context.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,1365-2311,,,,AUG,2015,40,4,,,,,451,460,,10.1111/een.12209,,,,,,,WOS:000357479700015,,,,,

So far, the use of olfaction for food detection among raptors has only been demonstrated for Cathartes vultures. The Oriental honey buzzard (Pernis orientalis) is a resident and migrant in Taiwan and regularly forages in apiaries. One of its foods in apiaries is yellow pollen dough, a softball-sized mixture of pollen, soybeans, and sugar that beekeepers provide as a supplementary food for bees. Given that pollen dough is not similar to any naturally occurring food, we hypothesized that buzzards identify the dough's nutritious contents using olfaction, perhaps in combination with vision. Using a series of choice experiments in which individuals could choose between two doughs, we showed that (1) buzzards almost unerringly chose pollen-containing over pollen lacking doughs when otherwise the doughs were identical in size, shape, and yellow color; (2) buzzards always preferred yellow over black or green doughs if both doughs contained pollen; (3) buzzards still preferred pollen-containing over pollen-lacking doughs when both doughs were black, but at a lower rate than in (1). We statistically excluded the possible influences of the doughs' relative brightness or of repeat visits by the same individuals. Our experiments thus suggest the use of a 'multi-modal foraging strategy' among buzzards whereby olfaction and vision are likely to be both used in identifying food at close distances. We also estimated the olfactory receptor gene repertoire size in the buzzard's genome which is almost five times as large as that of three other raptor species. Therefore, olfaction is likely of far greater ecological importance to this species than to other raptor species. We suggest that olfaction should be considered in the design of behavioral and genetic studies to better understand the use of multiple senses in avian behaviors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Jul-15,2015,10,7,,,,,,,e0130191,10.1371/journal.pone.0130191,,,,,,,WOS:000358197600019,26177533,,,,

These observations lend support to the 'Levy flight foraging hypothesis' which asserts that natural selection should have led to adaptations for Levy flight foraging, because Levy flights can optimize search efficiencies. The hypothesis stems from a rigorous theory of one-dimensional searching and from simulation data for two-dimensional searching. The potential effectiveness of three-dimensional Levy searches has not been examined but is central to a proper understanding of marine predators and T cells which have provided the most compelling empirical evidence for LW. Here I extend Levy search theory from one to three dimensions. The new theory predicts that three-dimensional Levy searching can be advantageous but only when targets are large compared with the perceptual range of the searchers, i.e. only when foragers are effectively blind and need to come into contact with a target to establish its presence.

Worker bees were collected from hives located in a polluted postmining area in South West Sardinia (Italy) that is also exposed to dust emissions from industrial plants. The area is included in an official list of sites of national interest for environmental remediation, and has been characterized for the effects of pollutants on the health of the resident population. The head, wings, hind legs and alimentary canal of the bees were investigated with Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Xray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). The analyses pointed to specific morphological and chemical features of the particulate, and resulted into the identification of three categories of particles: industry -, postmining -, and soil -derived. With the exception of the gut, all the analyzed body districts displayed inorganic particles, mostly concentrated in specific areas of the body (i.e. along the costal margin of the fore wings, the medial plane of the head, and the inner surface of the hind legs).

Nevertheless, specialized thieves of the Neotropical ant, Ectatomma ruidum, also known as the thieving ant', regularly enter and steal resources from distinct, neighboring colonies. Here, we examine the mechanisms and consequences of thievery in a population of E.ruidum. We show that (1) individuals from nearby colonies were accepted more often than those from farther colonies; (2) rejection rates decreased as individuals interacted more with non-nestmates from the same source colony; and (3) colonies that were experimentally treated to reduce thievery rates had improved productivity. The boost in productivity with thievery reduction was greater in low density populations than in high density populations. We conclude that, as in other species, thievery has negative fitness costs to E.ruidum. However, greater acceptance of neighbors than non-neighbors and increased acceptance after habituation to non-nestmates suggest a proximate explanation for the presence of thievery. Moreover, lower fitness costs of thievery at high nesting density, combined with observations of extraordinarily high densities of E.ruidum throughout its range, suggest there is little selection pressure among these ants to guard against thieves, thus providing an ultimate explanation why thievery persists among litter-foraging ants.

Arthropod natural enemies, involved in the ecosystem service of biological control, benefit from non-crop habitat and may be affected by its proximity and amount in the landscape. We have evaluated natural enemy richness and composition in relation to forest cover in the landscape and distance from the forest, for a Chaco Serrano forest-soybean crop system. Forest contribution to natural enemies on soybean was also investigated, by assessing similarities between forest and crop assemblages, and examining body size of shared enemies in relation to distance from the forest. In nine landscape circles, yellow pan traps were placed in forest and soybean crops (5, 25, 50 and 100m from forest edge), which collected 8041 specimens representing 290 species. Species richness of natural enemies was positively related to forest cover and declined from the forest to the furthermost soybean locations, with both forest cover and its proximity affecting community composition. Also, similarity of forest and crop assemblages increased with forest cover and proximity. Finally, forest-crop shared assemblages showed larger average body size at greater distances from the forest, indicating dispersal limitations on forest contribution to the crop.

However, costs associated with foraging can also influence food choice: animals faced with a poor-quality food source may either continue feeding on it (a conservative strategy), or search for a potentially more profitable one (a more risky strategy). Groups of nomadic, trail-following Malacosoma disstria caterpillars were offered a leaf of two different hosts, either side by side to determine preference, or at a distance to investigate how exploration costs affect food choice. Arenas with and without pheromone trails were used to distinguish between direct travel costs and unknown territory costs. When two leaves were side by side, groups of second-instar caterpillars showed clear preferences between host trees, whereas groups of fourth-instar larvae did not. When the two leaves were distant from each other, groups of second-instar caterpillars usually remained on the known source, irrespective of food preference or group size. These groups were more likely to relocate to a preferred food source when pheromone trails were present, suggesting that trails effectively decrease unknown territory costs. Groups of fourth-instar caterpillars were more likely to leave the known food source even when no trail was present, suggesting a developmental shift in costs associated with exploration. Our results show that collective choices reflect food preference when exploration costs are low (second-instar larvae with pheromone trails), but not when they are high (second-instar larvae without trails). Such a conservative foraging strategy can be adaptive if the exploration costs of leaving a known food source are greater than the potential benefits of discovering a better alternative, for example, in a homogenous environment like that of a tree.

In most groups, between 0.5 and 3.0% of species have been lost since 1900. Among the 7420 species I have assessed, 1.70% have arrived as natives since 1900. Unsurprisingly, there is a big difference between groups that contain many species that are able to fly (2.64% species are colonists) and those groups that are less mobile (0.18%).

A colorimetric method based on quantification of hydrogen peroxide released from oxalic acid in the presence of the oxalate oxidase was used to screen seed embryos from non-transgenic rows at various distances from the transgenic source. The overall transgene flow rate in three cultivars was 0.2094% based on screening over 85,000 seeds. In general, the transgene flow rate greatly declined past 10 m from the transgene source. However, a transgene flow rate of less than 0.05% did occur sporadically at greater distances than 10 m.

Whilst several studies have investigated how bees and wasps (aculeates) respond to management at the scale of the scheme (i.e. within the flower patch) there has been little assessment of how schemes affect diversity at the farm scale. In the current work we assessed whether farms implementing flower-rich schemes had richer aculeate communities than farms without such habitats. A total of 104 species of bee and 44 species of aculeate wasp were recorded. Farms providing flower-rich habitats had significantly greater floral abundance but there were no differences in the total number of aculeate or flowering plant species recorded compared to farms without these habitats. After accounting for differences in sample size, and contrary to expectations, farms without flower-rich habitats were significantly richer in aculeate and flowering plant species. Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) and honeybees (Apis mellifera) foraged strongly from sown flowers, but the majority of bee species preferred wild plants that are not included in flower-rich schemes such as Heracleum sphondylium, Hypochaeris radicata and Tripleurospermum inodorum. The creation of pollinator-friendly habitats has not increased the diversity of flowering plants and such schemes will consequently only benefit a limited suite of aculeate species. If diverse aculeate communities are to be retained and restored on farmland, agri-environment schemes that provide foraging and nesting resources for a wider range of pollinator species must be developed.

Research oriented towards a better understanding of the joint effects of land use and climate change over the provision of specific ecosystem services is therefore essential to safeguard such services. Here we propose a methodological framework, which integrates species distribution forecasts and graph theory to identify key conservation areas, which if protected or restored could improve habitat connectivity and safeguard ecosystem services. We applied the proposed framework to the provision of pollination services by a tropical stingless bee (Melipona quadrifasciata), a key pollinator of native flora from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and important agricultural crops. Based on the current distribution of this bee and that of the plant species used to feed and nest, we projected the joint distribution of bees and plants in the future, considering a moderate climate change scenario (following IPPC). We then used this information, the bee's flight range, and the current mapping of Atlantic Forest remnants to infer habitat suitability and quantify local and regional habitat connectivity for 2030, 2050 and 2080. Our results revealed north to south and coastal to inland shifts in the pollinator distribution during the next 70 years. Current and future connectivity maps unraveled the most important corridors, which if protected or restored, could facilitate the dispersal and establishment of bees during distribution shifts. Our results also suggest that coffee plantations from eastern Sao Paulo and southern Minas Gerais States could suffer a pollinator deficit in the future, whereas pollination services seem to be secured in southern Brazil. Landowners and governmental agencies could use this information to implement new land use schemes. Overall, our proposed methodological framework could help design novel conservational and agricultural practices that can be crucial to conserve ecosystem services by buffering the joint effect of habitat configuration and climate change.",,,,"Imperatriz-Fonseca, Vera L/H-5582-2012; Jaffe, Rodolfo/K-3230-2013; Acosta, Andre Luis/H-2036-2012; Giannini, Tereza/AAA-2958-2019; Giannini, Tereza C/F-2676-2012; Metzger, Jean Paul W./C-2514-2012; Saraiva, Antonio M/B-6350-2011; Tambosi, Leandro R/B-2359-2013","Imperatriz-Fonseca, Vera L/0000-0002-1079-2158; Jaffe, Rodolfo/0000-0002-2101-5282; Acosta, Andre Luis/0000-0002-4244-9637; Metzger, Jean Paul W./0000-0002-0087-5240; Saraiva, Antonio M/0000-0003-2283-1123; Tambosi, Leandro R/0000-0001-5486-7310; Giannini, Tereza/0000-0001-9830-1204",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Jun-19,2015,10,6,,,,,,,e0129225,10.1371/journal.pone.0129225,,,,,,,WOS:000356835000038,26091014,,,,

These include growing ornamental plant varieties attractive to flower-visiting insects. Because varieties vary greatly in attractiveness, there is a need to quantify it in order to give objective advice to gardeners. Here, we used the British national collection of asters to compare the attractiveness of varieties to flower-visiting insects. We counted and identified insects as they foraged on flowers in 228 varieties growing in discrete patches that flowered during the survey period, 14 September-20 October 2012. In each variety, we also determined the overall capitulum size, the central disc floret area, and the ray floret color (blue, red, purple, or white). We also scored attributes relevant to gardening: attractiveness to humans, ease of cultivation, and availability in the United Kingdom. There was great variation among varieties in their attractiveness to insects, ranging from 0.0 to 15.2 per count per square meter, and highly skewed, with most being unattractive. A similar skew held for the two main insect categories, honey bees and hover flies, which comprised 28 and 64% of all insects, respectively. None of the floral traits or attributes relevant to gardening correlated significantly with attractiveness to insects. Our study shows the practicality of using a national collection for quantifying and comparing the attractiveness of ornamental varieties to flower-visiting insects. These results imply that choosing varieties carefully is likely to be of conservation benefit to flower-visiting insects, and that doing so is a no-cost option in terms of garden beauty and workload.",,,,,"Garbuzov, Mihail/0000-0002-5743-9386",,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,1938-2936,,,,JUN,2015,44,3,,,,,638,646,,10.1093/ee/nvv037,,,,,,,WOS:000356183700022,26313970,,,,

The rate of behavioural development is highly plastic and responsive to changes in colony condition such that forager losses, disease or nutritional stresses accelerate behavioural development and cause an early onset of foraging in workers. It is not clear to what degree the behavioural development of workers can be accelerated without there being a cost in terms of reduced foraging performance. Here, we compared the foraging performance of bees induced to accelerate their behavioural development by treatment with the juvenile hormone analogue methoprene with that of controls that developed at a normal rate. Methoprene treatment accelerated the onset of both flight and foraging behaviour in workers, but it also reduced foraging span, the total time spent foraging and the number of completed foraging trips. Methoprene treatment did not alter performance in a short-range navigation task, however. These data indicate a limitation to the physiological plasticity of bees, and a trade off between forager performance and the speed at which bees begin foraging. Chronic stressors will be expected to reduce the mean age of the foraging force, and therefore also reduce the efficiency of the foraging force. This interaction may explain why honey bee colonies react to sustained stressors with non-linear population decline.",,,,,"Cheng, Ken/0000-0002-4913-2691; Barron, Andrew/0000-0002-8135-6628",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JUN,2015,218,11,,,,,1715,1724,,10.1242/jeb.119198,,,,,,,WOS:000355602000020,25883376,,,,

However, whether the use of parallax information is confined to specialised behaviours like these or represents a more general purpose sensory capability, is an open question. We investigate this issue in the foraging swallowtail butterfly Papilio xuthus, which we trained to associate a target presented on a monitor with a food reward. We then tracked the animal's flight in real-time, allowing us to manipulate the size and/or position of the target in a closed-loop manner to create the illusion that it is situated either above or below the monitor surface. Butterflies are less attracted to (i.e. slower to approach) targets that appear, based on motion parallax, to be more distant. Furthermore, we found that the number of abortive descent manoeuvres performed prior to the first successful target approach varies according to the depth of the virtual target, with expansion and parallax cues having effects of opposing polarity. However, we found no evidence that Papilio modulate the kinematic parameters of their descents according to the apparent distance of the target. Thus, we argue that motion parallax is used to identify a proximal target object, but that the subsequent process of approaching it is based on stabilising its edge in the 2D space of the retina, without estimating its distance.",,,,,"Arikawa, Kentaro/0000-0002-4365-0762",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JUN,2015,218,11,,,,,1725,1732,,10.1242/jeb.115063,,,,,,,WOS:000355602000021,25883380,,,,

We trained Cataglyphis fortis foragers along a two-segment route to investigate whether they encode the lengths of route segments over which visual cues remain approximately constant. Our results support earlier studies suggesting that such route-segment odometry exists, and allows an individual to stop using a visual route memory at an appropriate point, even in the absence of any change in the visual surroundings. But we find that the behavioural effects of route-segment odometry are often complicated by interactions with guidance from the global path-integration system. If route-segment odometry and path-integration agree, they act together to produce a precise signal for search. If the endpoint of route-segment odometry arrives first, it does not trigger search but its effect can persist and cause guidance by path-integration to end early. Conversely, if ants start with their path-integration state at zero, they follow a route memory for no more than 3 m, irrespective of the route-segment length. A possible explanation for these results is that if one guidance system is made to overshoot its endpoint, it can cause the other to be cut short.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-7594,1432-1351,,,,JUN,2015,201,6,,,SI,,617,630,,10.1007/s00359-015-1001-z,,,,,,,WOS:000354889000009,25904159,,,,

Multivariate ordination techniques (PCA and RDA) were employed to analyse forage-flora characteristics. Field margins represent valuable refuge areas for forage-species richness, but not for the abundance of forage species. On field margins, forage-species diversity benefits from the location of natural habitats (forests or meadows), primarily if the distance from these habitats is < 1000 m or the field acreage is < 10 ha. The shift from heterogeneous habitats to a more homogeneous landscape causes a reduction of forage floral diversity.

Urban habitats often support considerable biodiversity and so are of conservation value, even though they are highly modified ecosystems. Urban parks and gardens are rich in flowers that provide food for pollinators, including bees. Here, we use waggle dance decoding to investigate foraging by 3 honey bee hives located in the city of Brighton, UK, over almost an entire foraging season, April to October. Waggle dances were recorded using video cameras and decoded during framewise playback on a computer by measuring the angle and duration of the waggle phase. Foraging was mostly local (mean monthly distances 0.5-1.2 km) and mostly within the surrounding urban area (monthly means 78-92 %) versus the countryside (closest distance 2.2 km) even though this was well within the honey bee maximum foraging range (c. 12 km). These distances were lower than those from a previous study for hives located in a rural area 4.5 km away. Honey bees are very sensitive to foraging economics and foragers make waggle dances only after visiting high-quality feeding locations. Low distances advertised by dances, therefore, indicate sufficient forage nearby and show that urban areas can support honey bees year round.

Further, we asked (3) to what extent the presence of S. canadensis affected flower visitation of native plant species by pollinators. According to our results, the invasion reduced the native plant species richness throughout succession, although the most profound negative effect on plant diversity and vegetation naturalness was exerted in older successional communities. The invasion of S. canadensis had a negative effect on the abundance of bees irrespective of the old field age; however, there was no similar negative effect on hoverflies. Native flowers experienced reduced visitation by wild bees, honey bees and hoverflies due to the augmented presence of S. canadensis. Therefore, the invasion of this perennial plant species diverts the trajectory of vegetation succession, alters the mutualistic links between the native elements of these old fields, and causes a non-desired alternative stable states to be installed.",,,,"Edina, Torok/E-6692-2018","Edina, Torok/0000-0001-5982-7078; Vagasi, Csongor I./0000-0002-8736-2391; Shapiro, Julie Teresa/0000-0002-4539-650X",,,,,,,,,,,,1439-1791,1618-0089,,,,JUN,2015,16,4,,,,,335,346,,10.1016/j.baae.2015.03.003,,,,,,,WOS:000354173300007,,,,,

Worldwide declines in bee populations have raised awareness about the importance of their ecological role in maintaining ecosystem functioning. The naturally strong philopatric behavior that some bee species show can be detrimental to population viability through increased probability of inbreeding. Furthermore, bee populations found in human-altered landscapes, such as urban areas, can experience lower levels of gene flow and effective population sizes, increasing potential for inbreeding depression in wild bee populations. In this study, we investigated the fine-scale population structure of the solitary bee Colletes inaequalis in an urbanized landscape. First, we developed a predictive spatial model to detect suitable nesting habitat for this ground nesting bee and to inform our field search for nests. We genotyped 18 microsatellites in 548 female individuals collected from nest aggregations throughout the study area. Genetic relatedness estimates revealed that genetic similarity among individuals was slightly greater within nest aggregations than among randomly chosen individuals. However, genetic structure among nest aggregations was low (Nei's G(ST) = 0.011). Reconstruction of parental genotypes revealed greater genetic relatedness among females than among males within nest aggregations, suggesting male-mediated dispersal as a potentially important mechanism of population connectivity and inbreeding avoidance. Size of nesting patch was positively correlated with effective population size, but not with other estimators of genetic diversity. We detected a positive trend between geographic distance and genetic differentiation between nest aggregations. Our landscape genetic models suggest that increased urbanization is likely associated with higher levels of inbreeding. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of density and distribution of suitable nesting patches for enhancing bee population abundance and connectivity in human dominated habitats and highlights the critical contribution of landscape genetic studies for enhanced conservation and management of native pollinators.",,,,"Lopez-Uribe, Margarita/I-7112-2015","Danforth, Bryan/0000-0002-6495-428X",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,May-07,2015,10,5,,,,,,,UNSP e0125719,10.1371/journal.pone.0125719,,,,,,,WOS:000354214400043,25950429,,,,

Consequently, visual performance and acuity often significantly vary between different insect species. Whilst psychophysics has allowed for the accurate determination of visual acuity for some Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera, very little is known about other insect taxa that cannot be trained to positively respond to a given stimulus. In this study, we demonstrate that prior knowledge of insect colour preferences can be used to facilitate acuity testing. We focused on four psyllid species (Hemiptera: Psylloidea: Aphalaridae), namely Ctenarytaina eucalypti, Ctenarytaina bipartita, Anoeconeossa bundoorensis and Glycaspis brimblecombei, that differ in their colour preferences and utilization of different host-plant modules (e.g. apical buds, stems, leaf lamellae) and tested their visual acuity in a modified Y-maze adapted to suit psyllid searching behaviour. Our study revealed that psyllids have visual acuity ranging from 6.3 to 8.7 deg. Morphological measurements for different species showed a close match between inter-ommatidial angles and behaviourally determined visual angles (between 5.5 and 6.6 deg) suggesting detection of colour stimuli at the single ommatidium level. Whilst our data support isometric scaling of psyllids' eyes for C. eucalypti, C. bipartita and G. brimblecombei, a morphological trade-off between light sensitivity and spatial resolution was found in A. bundoorensis. Overall, species whose microhabitat preferences require more movement between modules appear to possess superior visual acuity.

Nearby populations without any geographic barrier between them may also suffer from ecological isolation driven by habitat heterogeneity, which may promote divergence by local adaptation and drift. Likewise, elevation gradients may influence the genetic structure and diversity of populations, particularly those marginally distributed. Bathysa australis (Rubiaceae) is a widespread tree along the elevation gradient of the Serra do Mar, SE Brazil. This self-compatible species is pollinated by bees and wasps and has autochoric seeds, suggesting restricted gene dispersal. We investigated the distribution of genetic diversity in six B.australis populations at two extreme sites along an elevation gradient: a lowland site (80-216m) and an upland site (1010-1100m.a.s.l.). Nine microsatellite loci were used to test for genetic structure and to verify differences in genetic diversity between sites. We found a marked genetic structure on a scale as small as 6km (F-ST=0.21), and two distinct clusters were identified, each corresponding to a site. Although B.australis is continuously distributed along the elevation gradient, we have not observed a gene flow between the extreme populations. This might be related to B.australis biological features and creates a potential scenario for adaptation to the different conditions imposed by the elevation gradient. We failed to find an isolation-by-distance pattern; although on the fine scale, all populations showed spatial autocorrelation until similar to 10-20m. Elevation difference was a relevant factor though, but we need further sampling effort to check its correlation with genetic distance. The lowland populations had a higher allelic richness and showed higher rare allele counts than the upland ones. The upland site may be more selective, eliminating rare alleles, as we did not find any evidence for bottleneck.",,,,"Santos, Flavio AM/C-1611-2012; de Souza, Anete Pereira/B-8663-2012; MM, Bajay/D-8956-2012","Santos, Flavio AM/0000-0002-4329-6214; de Souza, Anete Pereira/0000-0003-3831-9829; MM, Bajay/0000-0002-8196-3524",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,MAY,2015,5,9,,,,,1919,1931,,10.1002/ece3.1501,,,,,,,WOS:000354209800015,26140207,,,,

Given that a large number of species are rare, threatened, or endangered, and the entire family is included in Appendix II of CITES, the limited knowledge about their reproductive biology is of major concern. Mammiliaria pectimfera is an endangered, small, globose cactus endemic to the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan region in Central Mexico. We aimed to characterize some basic aspects of its reproductive biology in three populations. We described flower morphology and anthesis, identified floral visitors, and evaluated the occurrence of spontaneous self-fertilization and the success of open pollination. Diurnal anthesis in flowers lasted about 4 h/day and almost all flowers lasted only one day after opening. The analyses of variance revealed differences in flower morphology among populations. Herkogamy was positive and significantly different among populations. Field experiments revealed that open-pollinated flowers were highly successful in setting fruits and seeds. These results corroborate those reported in other Mammillaria species. Autonomous self-pollination was negligible and ineffective. Bees of the genus Ceratina were dominant among the captured flower visitors, and estimations of their maximum foraging distance indicated successful outcrossing in plants. This study indicates almost complete dependency of M. pectinifera on pollinators for fruits and seeds production. Our results serve as a basis for future research on reproductive biology of M. pectinifera and other rare and endangered cacti. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Complexity results from behavioural responses to external stimuli but can also arise spontaneously in their absence. Drawing on theoretical arguments about decision-making circuitry, we predict that the spontaneous patterns will be scale-free and universal, being independent of taxon and mode of locomotion. To test this hypothesis, we examined the activity patterns of the European honeybee, and multiple species of noctuid. moth, tethered to flight mills and exposed to minimal external cues. We also reanalysed pre-existing data for Drosophila flies walking in featureless environments. Across these species, we found evidence of common scale-invariant properties in their movement patterns; pause and movement durations were typically- power law distributed over a range of scales and characterized by exponents close to 3/2. Our analyses are suggestive of the presence of a pervasive scale-invariant template for locomotion which, when acted on by environmental cues, produces the movements with characteristic scales observed in nature. Our results indicate that scale-finite complexity as embodied, for instance, in correlated random walk models, may be the result of environmental cues overriding innate behaviour, and that scale-free movements may be intrinsic and not limited to 'blind' foragers as previously thought.",,,,"Reynolds, Donald R/C-7361-2013; Lim, Ka Sing/B-4480-2012; Wilson, Kenneth/B-7452-2008; Pearson, Aislinn/I-5421-2015","Lim, Ka Sing/0000-0002-9166-2928; Wilson, Kenneth/0000-0001-5264-6522; Pearson, Aislinn/0000-0002-9793-025X",,,,,,,,,,,,2054-5703,,,,,MAY,2015,2,5,,,,,,,150085,10.1098/rsos.150085,,,,,,,WOS:000377965600018,26064664,,,,

Possible harm to bees has resulted in the European Commission imposing a precautionary two-year moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids on bee-attractive crops from 2013. Recent laboratory and semi-field studies on colony-level effects of neonicotinoids assumed exclusive or near-exclusive levels of colony foraging on a treated crop. But is this a realistic assumption? Six honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies were monitored over two springs (April-May 2011/12) in two neighbouring locations (urban and rural) in and near Brighton, UK, to quantify foraging on oilseed rape, the most widespread beeattractive crop in the UK, by decoding waggle dances and trapping pollen. The study area was representative of the UK agricultural landscape in that the percentage area cover of the blooming oilseed rape fields around the rural location was similar to the national average (3.3-3.9% vs 3.1%). The amount of foraging on oilseed rape fields, as indicated by dance decoding, was variable, but low, 0-0.02% for the urban and 2-26% for the rural location. Almost all foraging, 91-99%, was within 2 km, even though honey bees can forage at distances of over 10 km. Pollen trapping in 2012 supported the dance decoding results, with oilseed rape pollen comprising 14% of pollen pellets collected by foragers from rural and 4% from urban hives. The results of this study have implications for policy as they cast doubt on the generality of some previous studies on colony-level effects on social bees conducted in laboratory and semi-field settings.

The Cerrado biome covers approximately 23% of Brazil and is one of the world's most important agricultural frontiers. Here, we conducted field experiments in the Brazilian Cerrado to evaluate the diversity of bees, their foraging behaviors and flower visiting periods, and their potential contribution to the performance of six melon (Cucumis melo L.) cultivars. Five bee species (Apis mellifera, Halictus sp., Plebeia sp., Trigona pallens, and T. spinipes) were recorded visiting both male and hermaphrodite flower types of all C melo cultivars. Whereas A. mellifera showed two peaks of flower visitation (an intense first one between 8:00 a.m. and 11 :00 a.m. and a second less intense one after 4:00 p.m.), all other bee species visited the C melo flowers only in the morning, with intensities and visitation peaks similar to those of A. mellifera. All of these bees collected nectar and pollen. Our results also indicated a moderate correlation between the intensity of bee visitation and fruit weight, demonstrating that all of these bees had the potential to pollinate C. melo and to influence its productivity. Except for the cultivar 'Hibrix', all the other cultivars showed economic feasibility and produced fruits of marketable sizes, with an estimated yield (over 25 tons/ha) in the range registered in other Brazilian regions.

While changes in DNA methylation accompany age polyethism, other DNA modifications accompanying age polyethism are less known. Changes in endopolyploidy (DNA amplification in the absence of cell division) with increased larval age are typical in many insect cells and are essential in adults for creating larger cells, more copies of essential loci, or greater storage capacity in secretory cells. However, changes in endopolyploidy with increased adult worker age and polyethism are unstudied. In this study, we examined endopolyploidy in honey bee workers ranging in age from newly emerged up to 55 days old. We found a nonsignificant increase in ploidy levels with age (P < 0.1) in the most highly endopolyploid secretory cells, the Malpighian tubules. All other cell types decreased ploidy levels with age. Endopolyploidy decreased the least amount (nonsignificant) in neural (brain) cells and the stinger (P < 0.1). There was a significant reduction of endopolyploidy with age in leg (P < 0.05) and thoracic (P < 0.001) muscles. Ploidy in thoracic muscle dropped from an average of 0.5 rounds of replication in newly emerged workers to essentially no rounds of replication (0.125) in the oldest workers. Ploidy reduction in flight muscle cells is likely due to the production of G1 (2C) nuclei by amitotic division in the multinucleate striated flight muscles that are essential to foragers, the oldest workers. We suggest that ploidy is constrained by the shape, size and makeup of the multinucleate striated muscle cells. Furthermore, the presence of multiple 2C nuclei might be optimal for cell function, while higher ploidy levels might be a dead-end strategy of some aging adult tissues, likely used to increase cell size and storage capacity in secretory cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Apr-16,2015,10,4,,,,,,,UNSP e0122208,10.1371/journal.pone.0122208,,,,,,,WOS:000353016500017,25881205,,,,

In this study, we investigated (1) pollinator nest distributions and estimated colony abundances, (2) the relationship between abundances of foraging workers and the number of nests they represent, (3) pollinator foraging ranges, and (4) the relationship between pollinator abundance and plant reproduction. We examined these questions in an alpine ecosystem in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, focusing on four alpine bumble bee species (Bombus balteatus, B. flavifrons, B. bifarius, and B. sylvicola), and two host plants that differ in their degrees of pollinator specialization (Trifolium dasyphyllum and T. parryi). Using microsatellites, we found that estimated colony abundances among Bombus species ranged from; similar to 18 to 78 colonies/0.01 km(2). The long-tongued species B. balteatus was most common, especially high above treeline, but the subalpine species B. bifarius was unexpectedly abundant for this elevation range. Nests detected among sampled foragers of each species were correlated with the number of foragers caught. Foraging ranges were smaller than expected for all Bombus species, ranging from 25 to 110 m. Fruit set for the specialized plant, Trifolium parryi, was positively related to the abundance of its Bombus pollinator. In contrast, fruit set for the generalized plant, T. dasyphyllum, was related to abundance of all Bombus species. Because forager abundance was related to nest abundance of each Bombus species and was an equally effective predictor of plant fecundity, forager inventories are probably suitable for assessing the health of outcrossing plant populations. However, nest abundance, rather than forager abundance, better reflects demographic and genetic health in populations of eusocial pollinators such as bumble bees. Development of models incorporating the parameters we have measured here (nest abundance, forager abundance, and foraging distance) could increase the usefulness of foraging worker inventories in monitoring, managing, and conserving pollinator populations.",,,,,"Strange, James/0000-0002-9612-6868",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,APR,2015,25,3,,,,,768,778,,10.1890/14-0151.1,,,,,,,WOS:000351849700016,26214921,,,,

Here we analyze the bee visiting ensemble on soybean flowers and the effects of pollinator visits on soybean reproductive success, within a fragmented Chaco forest landscape embedded in a soybean matrix in central Argentina. We assessed visitation rates in relation to distance from the forest (5, 50 and 100 m) compared soybean bee assemblages with those on wild flowers in the nearby forest fragments, and carried out an exclosure experiment in order to assess the contribution of insect visits to soybean reproductive success. We also analyzed the relationship between visitor body size and the distance from the forest to the visited flower. Five species belonging to two families of bees were observed visiting soybean flowers. The bee species observed on soybean were well represented in the forest, and Apis mellifera was the most abundant species, visiting soybean flowers at all studied distances from the forest. Instead, wild visitors displayed a turnover of species throughout those distances, with smaller species being restricted to the forest proximity and replaced by larger ones toward the interior of the crop. Total visitation rates were significantly and negatively affected by distance to the forest. All plant productivity variables measured in the exclosure experiments were significantly improved in exposed flowers, duplicating the values observed without pollinators. The present study offers preliminary evidence linking forest proximity to higher visitation rates and presence of wild pollinators on soybean flowers thus providing for the first time, evidence of the forest role as pollinator donor for the soybean crop. It also shows that pollinator activity matters for this crop, leading to increased soybean yield. Further research on this topic is necessary in order to provide informed guidelines to enhance soybean production while simultaneously promoting natural habitat conservation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using a mass-foraging stingless bee, Scaptotrigona pectoralis (Dalla Torre) (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini), we show that colonies will forage near their nests and allocate their foraging labor on a very fine spatial scale at an array of food sources placed close to the colony. We counted the foragers that a colony allocated to each of nine feeders containing 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0M sucrose solution [31, 43, and 55% sucrose (wt/wt), respectively] at distances of 10, 15, and 20m from the nest. A significantly greater number of foragers (2.6-5.3 fold greater) visited feeders placed 10 vs. 20m away from the colony. Foraging allocation also corresponded to food quality. At the 10-m feeders, 4.9-fold more foragers visited 2.0M as compared to 1.0M sucrose feeders. Colony forager allocation thus responded to both differences in food distance and quality even when the travel cost was negligible compared to normal colony foraging distances (10 m vs. an estimated 800-1710m).

Our working hypothesis is that within specialized mutualistic interactions, where each species relies on the co-occurrence of the other for survival and/or reproduction, partners are expected to show congruent evolutionary trajectories, because they are likely to have followed parallel migration routes and to have shared glacial refugia. LocationWestern Palaearctic. MethodsOur analysis relies on the extensive sampling of 104 Western Palaearctic populations (totalling 434, 159 and 74 specimens of Lysimachiavulgaris, Macropiseuropaea and Macropisfulvipes, respectively), genotyped with amplified fragment length polymorphism. Based on this, we evaluated the regional genetic diversity (Shannon diversity and allele rarity index) and genetic structure (assessed using structure, population networks, isolation-by-distance and spatial autocorrelation metrics) of each species. Finally, we compared the general phylogeographical patterns obtained. ResultsContrary to our expectations, the analyses revealed phylogeographical signals suggesting that the investigated organisms demonstrate independent post-glacial trajectories as well as distinct contemporaneous demographic parameters, despite their mutualistic interaction. Main conclusionsThe mutualistic partners investigated here are likely to be experiencing distinct and independent evolutionary dynamics because of their contrasting life-history traits (e.g. dispersal abilities), as well as distinct hubs and migration routes. Such conditions would prevent and/or erase any signature of co-structuring of lineages in space and time. As a result, the lack of phylogeographical congruence driven by differences in life-history traits might have arisen irrespective of the three species having shared similar Pleistocene glacial refugia.",,,,"Alvarez, Nadir/B-4318-2010","Alvarez, Nadir/0000-0002-0729-166X",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,APR,2015,42,4,,,,,630,640,,10.1111/jbi.12456,,,,,,,WOS:000350910100003,,,,,

To reveal the structure of consecutive orientation flights and hence gain insight into exploratory behaviour, we monitored individual bees from their first flight onwards using harmonic radar technology for flight tracking. We categorized flights into short- and long-range orientation flights. (1) Short-range flights are likely to be related to learning the specific features of the hive's immediate surroundings, and were performed significantly more frequently under unfavourable weather conditions. (2) The duration of long-range orientation flights declined from the first to the fourth flight because the bees spent less time inspecting the immediate surroundings of the hive. (3) Parts of single orientation flights were guided by extended parallel landscape structures on the ground. (4) During consecutive orientation flights bees explored novel sectors of the terrain. (5) Foraging flights performed after orientation flights covered greater distances and may involve a sector of the terrain not explored before, indicating that the acquired visual information plus path integration is sufficient for successful homing even from unfamiliar areas. (6) Exploration may be mixed with foraging flights after the initial orientation flights, sometimes leading to extremely long and elaborate flights.

One potential method of mitigating these effects is creating flower strips. Most previous studies have shown higher pollinator abundances in flower strips, but none have been able to demonstrate increased pollinator abundances at larger spatial scales, in the surrounding agricultural landscapes. We assessed local and landscape-wide effects of flower strips on pollinator abundances, using 18 carefully selected study landscapes in southern Sweden, distributed along independent gradients of landscape heterogeneity and farming intensity. We found that flower strips were more attractive than field borders in general to bumblebees, whereas hoverflies were only attracted to flower strips from nearby field borders. Solitary bees declined with increasing distance from flower strips, but only in complex landscapes. As one of the first studies investigating effects of flower strips on pollinators across the wider landscape, we found increased abundance of bumblebees, but not solitary bees, in field borders outside the flower strips in floristically enhanced landscapes as compared with control landscapes. However, we found that higher quality and/or larger total area of flower strips within a farm was important for both bumblebees and solitary bees. Hoverfly abundance was enhanced on farms with flower strips in simple landscapes. Our results demonstrate that flower strips with rewarding plants do not only attract pollinators locally, but in addition have the potential to increase pollinator abundances across entire landscapes, and particularly in landscapes dominated by farmland.

A number of agri-environment schemes have been implemented to halt and reverse these declines, predominantly revolving around the provision of additional forage plants. Although it has been demonstrated that these schemes can attract substantial numbers of foraging bumblebees, it remains unclear to what extent they actually increase bumblebee populations. We used standardized transect walks and molecular techniques to compare the size of bumblebee populations between Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) farms implementing pollinator-friendly schemes and Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) control farms. Bumblebee abundance on the transect walks was significantly higher on HLS farms than ELS farms. Molecular analysis suggested maximum foraging ranges of 566m for Bombus hortorum, 714m for B. lapidarius, 363m for B. pascuorum and 799m for B.terrestris. Substantial differences in maximum foraging range were found within bumblebee species between farm types. Accounting for foraging range differences, B.hortorum (47 vs 13 nests/km(2)) and B.lapidarius (45 vs 22 nests/km(2)) were found to nest at significantly greater densities on HLS farms than ELS farms. There were no significant differences between farm type for B.terrestris (88 vs 38 nests/km(2)) and B.pascuorum (32 vs 39 nests/km(2)). Across all bumblebee species, HLS management had a significantly positive effect on bumblebee nest density.

To assess the impact of these schemes for bumblebees, accurate measures of their populations are required. Here, we compared bumblebee population estimates on 16 farms using three commonly used techniques: standardised line transects, coloured pan traps and molecular estimates of nest abundance. There was no significant correlation between the estimates obtained by the three techniques, suggesting that each technique captured a different aspect of local bumblebee population size and distribution in the landscape. Bumblebee abundance as observed on the transects was positively influenced by the number of flowers present on the transect. The number of bumblebees caught in pan traps was positively influenced by the density of flowers surrounding the trapping location and negatively influenced by wider landscape heterogeneity. Molecular estimates of the number of nests of Bombus terrestris and B. hortorum were positively associated with the proportion of the landscape covered in oilseed rape and field beans. Both direct survey techniques are strongly affected by floral abundance immediately around the survey site, potentially leading to misleading results if attempting to infer overall abundance in an area or on a farm. In contrast, whilst the molecular method suffers from an inability to detect sister pairs at low sample sizes, it appears to be unaffected by the abundance of forage and thus is the preferred survey technique.",,,,"Goulson, David/A-2462-2010; Wood, Thomas/I-7025-2019","Goulson, David/0000-0003-4421-2876; Wood, Thomas/0000-0001-5653-224X; holland, john/0000-0003-3742-7035",,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,APR,2015,177,4,,,,,1093,1102,,10.1007/s00442-015-3255-0,,,,,,,WOS:000351470100016,25676106,,,,

However, little evidence is available on how and to what extent the pollen carryover affects the pollen-donor composition and on which insect taxa are effective outcross-pollen transporters under field conditions. In this study, we explored roles of foraging behavior of insect pollinators on pollen-donor composition and subsequent reproductive success in a woody plant. Methods We performed paternity analyses based on microsatellite genotyping of individual pollen grains found on diurnal pollinators (i.e., bumblebee, small bee, fly, small beetle, and honeybee) visiting Castanea crenata trees. Results The outcross-pollen rate was highest in bumblebees (66%), followed by small bees (35%), flies (31%), and small beetles (18%). The effective number of pollen donors, representing pollen carryover, was greater in bumblebees (9.71) than in flies (3.40), small bees (3.32), and small beetles (3.06). The high percentages of pollen from outside the plot on bumblebees (65.4%) and flies (71.2%) compared to small bees (35.3%) and small beetles (13.5%) demonstrated their longer pollen dispersal distances.

Various endpoints of colony performance and foraging behavior were measured during and after exposure, including winter survival. Imidacloprid residues became diluted or non-detectable within colonies due to the processing of beebread and honey and the rapid metabolism of the chemical. Imidacloprid exposure doses up to 100 mu g/kg had no significant effects on foraging activity or other colony performance indicators during and shortly after exposure. Diseases and pest species did not affect colony health but infestations of Varroa mites were significantly higher in exposed colonies. Honey stores indicated that exposed colonies may have avoided the contaminated food. Imidacloprid dose effects was delayed later in the summer, when colonies exposed to 20 and 100 mu g/kg experienced higher rates of queen failure and broodless periods, which led to weaker colonies going into the winter. Pooled over two years, winter survival of colonies averaged 85.7, 72.4, 61.2 and 59.2% in the control, 5, 20 and 100 mu g/kg treatment groups, respectively. Analysis of colony survival data showed a significant dose effect, and all contrast tests comparing survival between control and treatment groups were significant, except for colonies exposed to 5 mu g/kg. Given the weight of evidence, chronic exposure to imidacloprid at the higher range of field doses (20 to 100 mu g/kg) in pollen of certain treated crops could cause negative impacts on honey bee colony health and reduced overwintering success, but the most likely encountered high range of field doses relevant for seed-treated crops (5 mu g/kg) had negligible effects on colony health and are unlikely a sole cause of colony declines.",,,,"Serrano, Jose/A-2854-2009","Serrano, Jose/0000-0002-1565-5216",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Mar-18,2015,10,3,,,,,,,UNSP e0118748,10.1371/journal.pone.0118748,,,,,,,WOS:000352138500046,25786127,,,,

Any such differences will affect ecosystem assembly. Thus, it is important to understand why unequal dispersal rates might occur. Recent studies have indicated strong differences between forward and backward dispersal in two major bee groups, Hylaeinae and Allodapini. Here, we use a third bee group, tribe Ceratinini, to determine whether this might be a more general phenomenon. LocationWorldwide. MethodsCeratinini is globally distributed (excepting Antarctica) and contains the single genus Ceratina and 21 subgenera, most of which are endemic to continents. We examined the phylogeny of Ceratinini using sequence data from three genes and 99 species, and inferred ancestral distributions using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. ResultsWe show that the tribe Ceratinini had an African origin in the early Eocene. This was followed by four dispersals out of Africa in the Eocene and early Oligocene and three further dispersals between the Miocene and the present. There has been no back-dispersal of Ceratinini to Africa. The lack of back-dispersal cannot be explained by species abundance in non-African regions, and physical barriers to back-dispersal seem unlikely. Main conclusionsOur results are similar to findings for two other major bee groups and indicate that back-dispersal is very rare. It is unlikely that physical barriers can explain these patterns. However, dispersal patterns might be explained by assembly rules such as niche pre-emption or by reduced opportunities for escaping into enemy-free space. At a continental level, it is likely that the composition of bee fauna is more strongly influenced by very early dispersal events rather than by later physical barriers to dispersal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,MAR,2015,42,3,,,,,485,494,,10.1111/jbi.12439,,,,,,,WOS:000350559900007,,,,,

Bumble bees are one of the most effective pollinators in both natural and cultivated landscapes, but are often the first to be extirpated in human-altered habitats. Yet, little is known about the role of natural and human-altered habitats in promoting or limiting bumble bee gene flow. In this study, I closely examine the genetic structure of the yellow-faced bumble bee, Bombusvosnesenskii, across the southwestern US coast and find strong evidence that natural oceanic barriers, as well as contemporary human-altered habitats, limit bee gene flow. Heterozygosity and allelic richness were lower in island populations, while private allelic richness was higher in island populations compared to mainland populations. Genetic differentiation, measured for three indices across the 1000km study region, was significantly greater than the null expectation (F-ST=0.041, F'(ST)=0.044 and D-est=0.155) and correlated with geographic distance. Furthermore, genetic differentiation patterns were most strongly correlated with contemporary (2011) not past (2006, 2001) resistance maps calibrated for high dispersal limitation over oceans, impervious habitat and croplands. Despite the incorporation of dramatic elevation gradients, the analyses reveal that oceans and contemporary human land use, not mountains, are the primary dispersal barriers for B.vosnesenskii gene flow.

Amongst other plants, over 600 species of orchids are exclusively pollinated by the bees during their quest for volatiles. Since the plants usually have a scattered distribution, it is assumed that orchid bees can transport the pollinaria across several kilometres due to their flight capabilities and a high dispersal potential. Until now, very long-range flight distances (up to 45 km) of male orchid bees have only been indirectly inferred from habitat requirements of orchids whose pollinaria were carried by captured males, whereas the distances established by direct measures (mark and recapture, radio telemetry) only span distances of up to around 6 km. The discrepancy between inferred and proven distances led us to readdress the question of dispersal ability of male orchid bees. In this study, we used tag, scratch and chemical marking of large numbers of bees to clarify two aspects: (1) the effect of moderate natural obstacles on dispersal and (2) the possibility of very long-range movements across a terrain lacking such obstacles.

The quantity of individual essential amino acids (EAAs) obtained from dietary protein depends on the protein source, but how the proportion of EAAs in the diet affects nutrient balancing has rarely been studied. Recent research using the Geometric Framework for Nutrition has revealed that forager honeybees who receive much of their dietary EAAs from floral nectar and not from solid protein have relatively low requirements for dietary EAAs. Here, we examined the nutritional requirements for protein and carbohydrates of foragers of the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris. By using protein (sodium caseinate) or an equimolar mixture of the 10 EAAs, we found that the intake target (nutritional optimum) of adult workers depended on the source and proportion of dietary EAAs. When bees consumed caseinate-containing diets in a range of ratios between 1:250 and 1:25 (protein to carbohydrate), they achieved an intake target (IT) of 1: 149 (w/w). In contrast to those fed protein, bees fed the EAA diets had an IT more biased towards carbohydrates (1: 560 w/w) but also had a greater risk of death than those fed caseinate. We also tested how the dietary source of EAAs affected free AAs in bee haemolymph. Bees fed diets near their IT had similar haemolymph AA profiles, whereas bees fed diets high in caseinate had elevated levels of leucine, threonine, valine and alanine in the haemolymph. We found that like honeybees, bumblebee workers prioritize carbohydrate intake and have a relatively low requirement for protein. The dietary source of EAAs influenced both the ratio of protein/EAA to carbohydrate and the overall amount of carbohydrate eaten.

In this study, we investigated the impact of past climate, and also the potential impact of host plant species abundance, on intraspecific genetic variation in three codistributed and related specialized solitary bees of the genus Melitta with very similar life history traits and dispersal capacities. We sequenced five independent loci in samples collected from the three species. Our analyses revealed that the species associated with the most abundant host plant species (Melitta leporina) displays unusually high genetic variation, to an extent that is seldom reported in phylogeographic studies of animals and plants. This suggests a potential role of food resource abundance in determining current patterns of genetic variation in specialized herbivorous insects. Patterns of genetic variation in the two other species indicated lower overall levels of diversity, and that M.nigricans could have experienced a recent range expansion. Ecological niche modelling of the three Melitta species and their main host plant species suggested a strong reduction in range size during the last glacial maximum. Comparing observed sequence data with data simulated using spatially explicit models of coalescence suggests that M.leporina recovered a range and population size close to their current levels at the end of the last glaciation, and confirms recent range expansion as the most likely scenario for M.nigricans.

Though most blueberry growers in eastern Canada use managed bees in lowbush blueberry pollination, native pollinators are recognized as an important component of the pollination service provision. In this study we examined the diversity and abundance of native bees in lowbush blueberry fields in Nova Scotia, while considering spatial and temporal patterns in their distribution over the growing season. In total, we collected 95 species representing 13 genera, of which Lasioglossum and Andrena comprised >92% of all individuals. The abundance of several of the most common species was inversely related to distance from the forest edge, but was low inside the adjacent forest. In contrast, species diversity was highest inside the forest and consistently low within fields. Larger bees were found further into fields than smaller bees. Whereas some abundant bees were collected most often outside the blueberry bloom period, Lasioglossum cressonii, the most abundant species, was collected often during blueberry bloom, suggesting it could be an effective pollinator in this system.

It has been shown that garden management regime (water use, floral composition) may impact the species they shelter. However, due to access restrictions, lack of regulations and the difficulty of data collection on private property, the impact of management practices and in particular pesticide use has seldom been assessed in private gardens. Using data collected in the framework of a nationwide participatory monitoring scheme in France, we assess here, for the first time, the effect of private garden management on two important groups of flower-visiting insects, i.e. butterflies and bumblebees, at a large scale. We show that the correlation between butterfly and bumblebee abundance and use of insecticides and herbicides is negative, whereas the use of Bordeaux mixture (fungicide approved for organic use), fungicides and anti-slugs is positively correlated with butterfly and bumblebee abundance. We hypothesize that herbicides have an indirect negative impact on insects by limiting the amount of available resources, and that the Bordeaux mixture, fungicides and slug repellants have an indirect positive impact on these insects by fostering healthier plants, probably offering higher level of resources to pollinators. Moreover, we show that the impact of pesticides varies according to the landscape, the negative effect of insecticides being more important in highly urbanized areas. Overall, our results show that gardener practices can have a positive impact on flower-visiting insects, even in a highly anthropized, urban landscape. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The evolutionary history of species and their functional traits may provide mechanistic links between community assembly and the environment. Such links may be hierarchically structured such that the strength of environmental filtering decreases in a step-wise manner from regional conditions through landscape heterogeneity to local habitat conditions. We sampled the wild bee species assemblages in power-line strips transecting forests in south-eastern Norway. We used altitude, landscape diversity surrounding sites and plant species composition, together with total plant cover as proxies for regional, landscape and local environmental filters, respectively. The species richness and abundance of wild bees decreased with altitude. The reduction in species richness and abundance was accompanied by a phylogenetic clustering of wild bee individuals. Furthermore, regional filters followed by local filters best explained the structure of the functional species composition. Sites at high altitudes and sites with Ericaceae-dominated plant communities tended to have larger bees and a higher proportion of social and spring-emerging bees. When Bombus species were excluded from the analysis, the proportion of pollen specialists increased with the dominance of Ericaceae. Furthermore, we also found that the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional compositional turnover between sites was higher in the northern region than in the southern part of the study region. Altogether, these results suggest that regional filters drive the species richness and abundance in trait-groups whereas local filters have more descrete sorting effects. We conclude that the model of multi-level environmental filters provides a good conceptual model for community ecology. We suggest that future studies should focus on the relationship between the biogeographical history of species and their current distribution, and on the assumption that closely related species do indeed compete more intensely than distantly related species.",,,,"Moe, Stein R./G-1507-2011","Moe, Stein R./0000-0003-1005-3192; Sydenham, Markus Arne Kjaer/0000-0002-7711-2399",,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,FEB,2015,38,2,,,,,140,153,,10.1111/ecog.00938,,,,,,,WOS:000349463400005,,,,,

Whether compensation is possible will depend on functional diversity in the wild bee community and on the distribution of habitat and resources within the landscape surrounding an orchard that affect wild bee abundance. We studied pollination services and bee functional diversity in 20 apple orchards in southern Quebec, Canada. We evaluated pollinator efficacy by studying: apple visitation rates, approach (front or side-working), body size, foraging type (pollen or nectar foraging), sociality, temporal and climatic activity patterns, and pollen carrying habit. Pollination services were measured as apple fruit set and seed set. A distance-based measure of functional diversity, calibrated with bee traits and weighted by species relative abundance in the wild bee community, was used to model pollination services. We correlated the landscape composition and configuration of surrounding natural (forest) and semi-natural (meadow) habitats with bee diversity and pollination services. The incidence of fruit set and seed set in orchards increased with bee functional diversity. Complementarity between managed versus unmanaged bees in traits associated with foraging and resource use drove this relationship. Seed set was also negatively correlated with both the mean distance from surrounding meadows and the total area of surrounding orchards. Bee functional diversity was positively associated with surrounding meadow and forest area. These two land classes complement each other in their seasonal provision of foraging resources for bees. Our models can be used to prescribe management and conservation objectives for bee habitat management that promote pollination services. We identify useful wild bee pollinators and discuss their needs in terms of landscape composition and configuration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The absence of morphological diagnostic characters for the identification of some species creates difficulties for basic ecological studies, and for conservation management. The widespread and commercially exploited bumblebee subgenus Bombus serisu stricto contains a cryptic species complex, known as the lucorum complex, which in Europe comprises B. lucorum, B. cryptarum and B. magnus. Little is known about these species and much of what has been reported is likely to have suffered from incorrect identification. Although the lucorum complex as a whole is common in Great Britain, we aimed to determine whether the populations of the individual species are vulnerable and require conservation action. Using genetic methods to distinguish them, we determined the geographic distribution and abundance of the lucorum complex species in Great Britain, and assessed the extent of niche differentiation between these species. We detected major differences in the geographic range, forage use and sensitivity to summer temperatures of the three species. Bombus lucorum was found to have the broadest distribution, and diet, being present throughout mainland Great Britain, whereas B. cryptarum and B. magnus were absent from large areas of central and southern England. Bombus cryptarum and B. magnus were more likely to be found at sites with lower summer temperatures. Bombus magnus, the least abundant species, was found to exhibit an unusually tight biotope association with heathland habitat. This has conservation implications for B. magnus given the current threats to this habitat type.

Both types of ants were ambidextrous in 2012, and so were unmarked ants in 2013. In contrast, marked ants in 2013 had a preference for leading with their right mandible. The individual laterality of these latter ants ranged from ambidexterity to about 70 % use of the preferred leading mandible. In 2013, we also estimated the cutting rate (length cut per second spent cutting) and harvesting rate (leaf area harvested per second spent cutting) of cutting events for marked foragers. Despite significant positive correlations between head size and both cutting and harvesting rates, the intensity of lateralization was better explained by cutting and harvesting rates than by head size. Specifically, the most lateralized foragers were the slowest and harvested the smallest leaf area per second.

To assess whether the models provide an accurate description of bumblebee colour space, we trained bees to discriminate four colour pairs. The perceptual distance between the colours of each pair was similar according to the CH model but varied widely according to the COC and RN models. The time that bees required to select a flower and the proportion of correct choices differed between groups: decision times decreased as achromatic contrast increased, and the proportion of correct choices increased with achromatic contrast and perceptual distance, as predicted by the COC and RN models. These results suggest that both chromatic and achromatic contrasts affected the discriminability of colour pairs.

Aerial photographs were used to detect and map fields of blooming OSR in eight 20 x 20 kilometers(2) areas across England where OSR is grown. We determined the distance to the nearest OSR field for randomly chosen positions (i.e., potential hive locations) using a digital map made of each area. The proportion of colonies within foraging range to the nearest OSR field in each area was then calculated using published data on honeybee foraging distances obtained by waggle dance decoding. We found that the distribution of distances to the nearest OSR field varied greatly among study areas, ranging from almost all colonies being within range to almost all being out of range (6-79% were within median foraging distance). In one study area, we examined changes over a 4-year period and found little year-to-year variation due to crop rotation (23-36% within median foraging distance).

The patterns of a waggle dance contain both distance and directional information. Nevertheless, the dance varies depending on the context in which it is performed; absconding, swarming, or foraging. This study is an extension of the study by Duangphakdee, Radloff, Pirk, and Hepburn (2009), who investigated whether the sun's azimuth (altitude angle of the sun) affected Apis florea F. absconding waggle dances and what effect this had on colony decision-making and behavior. In this study, we add flight and foraging activities to the absconding data from Duangphakdee, Radloff, Pirk, and Hepburn (2009) and tested what effects, if any, the altitude angle had on other behavior and activities both at colony and individual levels. We report the number of waggle dances performed per unit time by A. florea foragers from 07:00 to 17:00 h. The mean frequency distribution of the number of foragers dancing showed a clear-cut trough between 12:00 and 13:00 h. The angular deviation in the run portion of the waggle dances increased significantly by 7 degrees between 12:00 and 13:00 h relative to dance angles recorded prior to or post the noon period. We suggest that the imprecision of forager waggle dances, for an hour around noon, is caused by the honeybees' difficulty in determining the location of the sun's azimuth, as was shown by Duangphakdee, Radloff, Pirk, and Hepburn (2009) in A. florea scout dances over the noon period. Colony-based decision-making relies heavily upon the precision of waggle dances, especially when a major event such as absconding or swarming occurs; based on accurate dance information, the colony prepares to move its stores and synchronize its relocation as a cohesive unit to the new nest site. However, decision-making by foragers on an individual level was not negatively affected by the inaccuracy of the waggle dances performed during the noon period, nor did it affect the number of foragers in the field.",,,,"Pirk, Christian/E-4180-2010","Pirk, Christian/0000-0001-6821-7044",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8839,2078-6913,,,,,2015,54,3,,,,,246,254,,10.1080/00218839.2016.1151631,,,,,,,WOS:000374902200014,,,,,

Small and isolated populations in particular may suffer from disrupted pollination processes. However, a species' response to fragmentation may vary according to life history traits. Understanding how pollen dispersal is shaped by population and life history traits such as mating system and clonal growth is therefore essential for assessing species' response to fragmentation. Methods - We investigated pollen dispersal using fluorescent dyes in nine Belgian populations in two regions of the distylous insect-pollinated clonal herb Menyanthes trifoliata. We examined whether overall and legitimate (i.e. between-morph) dye dispersal patterns differed between morphs and regions, and whether they were influenced by population traits (size, area, plant density, morph ratio, co-flowering species) and individual plant traits (number of flowers). Key Results - No evidence of dye transfer between adjacent populations (distant from 1.3 to 11.8 km) was found, suggesting no or very restricted between-population pollen flow. Within-population dye dispersal followed a decaying, usually leptokurtic, distribution, with most dye deposition at short distances (80% at less than 1.9-49.1 m), and a maximum distance of 336.6 m. Pins and thrums as recipients or donors did not differ in dye dispersal. Legitimate dye dispersal was not less successful than overall dispersal despite spatial clumping of the morphs.

This study aims to determine this radius and focuses on the effects of conspecific plant density, plant sex and the amount of shrub vegetation on visitation rates of Clusia blattophila, a dioecious bush pollinated by Amazonina platystylata cockroaches. The number of visits did not differ between flower sexes but cockroaches spent less time on the rewardless female flowers. The density effect was scale dependent. The distribution of flowering individuals within the 15-m radius had a significant positive effect on flower visitation rates. At a larger scale (35-45-m radius), an increase in density of male plants led to a decrease in visitation rates, indicating competition for pollinators. Within the smaller radius, the facilitative effect was probably induced by elevated floral advertisement and high mobility of cockroaches at this scale. Within the larger radii, the results indicated that cockroach mobility was restricted and population density was stable at this scale. Density of male plants affected visitation rates because only male plants reward pollinators. Hence, male plants were the true competitors.",,,,,"Vlasakova, Blanka/0000-0001-9288-5448",,,,,,,,,,,,0266-4674,1469-7831,,,,JAN,2015,31,,1,,,,95,98,,10.1017/S0266467414000571,,,,,,,WOS:000353215400010,,,,,

Here, we investigate the effects of patch size on insect visitation in patches of smaller area (range c. 0.1-3.1 m(2)), which are of particular relevance to ornamental flower beds in parks and gardens. We studied two common garden plant species in full bloom with 6 patch sizes each: borage (Borago officinalis) and lavender (Lavandula x intermedia 'Grosso'). We quantified flower visitation by insects by making repeated counts of the insects foraging at each patch. On borage, all insects were honey bees (Apis mellifera, n = 5506 counts). On lavender, insects (n = 737 counts) were bumble bees (Bombus spp., 76.9%), flies (Diptera, 22.4%), and butterflies (Lepidoptera, 0.7%). On both plant species we found positive linear effects of patch size on insect numbers. However, there was no effect of patch size on the number of insects per unit area or per flower and, on lavender, for all insects combined or only bumble bees. The results show that it is possible to make unbiased comparisons of the attractiveness of plant species or varieties to flower-visiting insects using patches of different size within the small scale range studied and make possible projects aimed at comparing ornamental plant varieties using existing garden flower patches of variable area.

The flowering period of R. cyanocarpum ranges from late March to middle May and a single flower can last 8-10 days in its natural habitat. Flowers generally show marked herkogamy and the protruding style encourages pollinator foraging behavior that counteracts self-pollination. Floral scents comprise mostly aliphatics (64.37%) and terpenoids (29.88%), which make the flowers attractive for several insect groups, but a peak at 430nm in the reflectance spectrum of petals suggest selection for the attraction of bumblebees.

Understanding how increasing habitat loss affects ecological processes is critical for mitigating the effects of environmental changes on biodiversity and thus on the supply of ecosystem services by natural habitats. Habitat loss negatively affects pollinator diversity and the pollination service provided by insects, a key ecosystem service supporting the quantity, quality and diversity of crops directly consumed by humans and the sexual reproduction of most flowering plants. By integrating evolutionary relationships among traits that may modulate plant response to habitat loss, the structure of plant-pollinator interaction networks and metacommunity models, we examine how plant-pollinator metacommunities might respond to habitat loss. The main predictions of our trait-based metacommunity model are that (1) variation on dispersal ability among plant species may prevent full metacommunity collapse under pollinator loss associated with increasing habitat loss; (2) habitat loss may select for plants with higher dispersal ability and higher autogamous self-pollination, and will typically decrease the incidence of pollination generalist plants; (3) metacommunities that comprise plants with high autonomous self-pollination ability may harbour higher richness of rare plant species when pollinator diversity declines with increased habitat loss.

Nonetheless, only few studies have been carried out with pollinators, usually emphasizing the honeybee Apis mellifera and neglecting other important pollinator species such as the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Here, lethal and sublethal effects of azadirachtin were studied on B. terrestris via oral exposure in the laboratory to bring out the potential risks of the compound to this important pollinator. The compound was tested at different concentrations above and below the maximum concentration that is used in the field (32 mg L-1). As most important results, azadirachtin repelled bumblebee workers in a concentration-dependent manner. The median repellence concentration (RC50) was estimated as 504 mg L-1. Microcolonies chronically exposed to azadirachtin via treated sugar water during 11 weeks in the laboratory exhibited a high mortality ranging from 32 to 100 % with a range of concentrations between 3.2 and 320 mg L-1. Moreover, no reproduction was scored when concentrations were higher than 3.2 mg L-1. At 3.2 mg L-1, azadirachtin significantly inhibited the egg-laying and, consequently, the production of drones during 6 weeks. Ovarian length decreased with the increase of the azadirachtin concentration. When azadirachtin was tested under an experimental setup in the laboratory where bumblebees need to forage for food, the sublethal effects were stronger as the numbers of drones were reduced already with a concentration of 0.64 mg L-1. Besides, a negative correlation was found between the body mass of male offspring and azadirachtin concentration. In conclusion, our results as performed in the laboratory demonstrated that azadirachtin can affect B. terrestris with a range of sublethal effects. Taking into account that sublethal effects are as important as lethal effects for the development and survival of the colonies of B. terrestris, this study confirms the need to test compounds on their safety, especially when they have to perform complex tasks such as foraging. The latter agrees with the recent European Food Safety Authority guidelines to assess 'potentially deleterious' compounds for sublethal effects on behavior.",,,,"Guedes, Raul Narciso Carvalho/L-3924-2013; Smagghe, Guy/AAE-8914-2019; Barbosa, Wagner Faria/F-9531-2015","Guedes, Raul Narciso Carvalho/0000-0001-6229-7549; Smagghe, Guy/0000-0001-8334-3313; Barbosa, Wagner Faria/0000-0001-8725-2099",,,,,,,,,,,,0963-9292,1573-3017,,,,JAN,2015,24,1,,,,,130,142,,10.1007/s10646-014-1365-9,,,,,,,WOS:000347693100012,25300506,,,,

A large section of the assessment is dedicated to the state of knowledge on sublethal effects on honeybees (Apis mellifera) because this important pollinator is the most studied non-target invertebrate species. Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Lumbricidae (earthworms), Apoidae sensu lato (bumblebees, solitary bees) and the section ""other invertebrates"" review available studies on the other terrestrial species. The sections on freshwater and marine species are rather short as little is known so far about the impact of neonicotinoid insecticides and fipronil on the diverse invertebrate fauna of these widely exposed habitats. For terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate species, the known effects of neonicotinoid pesticides and fipronil are described ranging from organismal toxicology and behavioural effects to population-level effects. For earthworms, freshwater and marine species, the relation of findings to regulatory risk assessment is described. Neonicotinoid insecticides exhibit very high toxicity to a wide range of invertebrates, particularly insects, and field-realistic exposure is likely to result in both lethal and a broad range of important sublethal impacts. There is a major knowledge gap regarding impacts on the grand majority of invertebrates, many of which perform essential roles enabling healthy ecosystem functioning. The data on the few non-target species on which field tests have been performed are limited by major flaws in the outdated test protocols. Despite large knowledge gaps and uncertainties, enough knowledge exists to conclude that existing levels of pollution with neonicotinoids and fipronil resulting from presently authorized uses frequently exceed the lowest observed adverse effect concentrations and are thus likely to have large-scale and wide ranging negative biological and ecological impacts on a wide range of non-target invertebrates in terrestrial, aquatic, marine and benthic habitats.",,,,"Settele, Josef/A-6371-2009; Serrano, Jose/A-2854-2009; van der Sluijs, Jeroen P/B-6302-2008; Liess, Matthias/A-8582-2009; , Belzunces/P-7061-2019; Goulson, David/A-2462-2010; Wiemers, Martin/B-5715-2011","Settele, Josef/0000-0002-8624-4983; Serrano, Jose/0000-0002-1565-5216; van der Sluijs, Jeroen P/0000-0002-1346-5953; Liess, Matthias/0000-0002-3321-8909; , Belzunces/0000-0003-1798-9962; Goulson, David/0000-0003-4421-2876; Wiemers, Martin/0000-0001-5272-3903; Morrissey, Christy/0000-0001-8128-4209",,,,,,,,,,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,JAN,2015,22,1,,,,,68,102,,10.1007/s11356-014-3471-x,,,,,,,WOS:000347407200004,25223353,,,,

Studies on the dance precision of Apis mellifera have shown that the dance is often imprecise. Two hypotheses have been put forward aimed at explaining this imprecision. The first argues that imprecision in the context of foraging is adaptive as it ensures that the dance advertises the same patch size irrespective of distance. The second argues that the bees are constrained in their ability to be more precise, especially when the source is nearby. Recent studies have found support for the latter hypothesis but not for the ""tuned-error"" hypothesis, as the adaptive hypothesis became known. Here we investigate intra-dance variation among Apis species. We analyse the dance precision of A. florea, A. dorsata, and A. mellifera in the context of foraging and swarming. A. mellifera performs forage dances in the dark, using gravity as point of reference, and in the light when dancing for nest sites, using the sun as point of reference. Both A. dorsata and A. florea are open-nesting species; they do not use a different point of reference depending on context. A. florea differs from both A. mellifera and A. dorsata in that it dances on a horizontal surface and does not use gravity but instead ""points"" directly toward the goal when indicating direction. Previous work on A. mellifera has suggested that differences in dance orientation and point of reference can affect dance precision. We find that all three species improve dance precision with increasing waggle phase duration, irrespective of differences in dance orientation, and point of reference. When dancing for sources nearby, dances are highly variable. When the distance increases, dance precision converges. The exception is dances performed by A. mellifera on swarms. Here, dance precision decreases as the distance increases. We also show that the size of the patch advertised increases with increasing distance, contrary to what is predicted under the tuned-error hypothesis.",,,,"Beekman, Madeleine/AAF-8574-2019","Beekman, Madeleine/0000-0002-9040-3756",,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,,2015,3,,,,,,,,11,10.3389/fevo.2015.00011,,,,,,,WOS:000485318800019,,,,,

Some members of the company or colony prospect for valuable liquid resources. When these are discovered other group members can be recruited to exploit the resource. The recruitment of nestmates to a specific location where there is a patch of flowers should change the economics of scouting, that is, the search for new resource patches. In particular, communication is predicted to make scouting at longer distances worthwhile because a profitable resource patch, once discovered, will enhance the foraging not only of the discoverer but also of nestmates that can be directed to the patch. By virtue of having large colonies and dance communication, honey bees are predicted to be able to profitably scout, and hence forage, at greater distances from the nest than either solitary bees or social bees without communication. We test this hypothesis by first examining existing data on foraging distance to evaluate whether honey bees do indeed forage at greater distances than other bees given their body size. Second, we present a simple cost-benefit analysis of scouting which indicates that communication causes longer range scouting to be more profitable. Overall, our analyses are supportive, but not conclusive, that honey bees forage further than would be expected given their size and that the waggle dance is a cause of the honey bee's exceptional foraging range.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,,2015,3,,,,,,,,31,10.3389/fevo.2015.00031,,,,,,,WOS:000485318800039,,,,,

Our results show that the direction component conveys 2.9 bits and the distance component 4.5 bits of information, which agrees to some extent with Haldane and Spurway's estimates that were based on data gathered by von Frisch.

The corolla of Coccinia species is sympetalous, usually pale yellow to orange, and 1 to 4.5 cm long. Pollination is by bees foraging for pollen or nectar. After pollination, the developing ovary often exhibits longitudinal mottling, which usually disappears during maturation. All species produce berries with a pericarp in reddish colors (orange-red through to scarlet red), hence the generic name. The globose to cylindrical fruits contain numerous grayish-beige flat to lenticular seeds. Chromosome numbers are 2n = 20, 24, and 22 + XX/XY.

Among them, the yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, is a keen hunter of domestic honeybees. Its recent introduction to Europe may induce important beekeeping, pollination, and biodiversity problems. Hornets use olfactory cues for the long-range detection of food sources, in this case the location of honeybee colonies, but the exact nature of these cues remains unknown. Here, we studied the orientation behavior of V. velutina workers towards a range of hive products and protein sources, as well as towards prominent chemical substances emitted by these food sources. In a multiple choice test performed under controlled laboratory conditions, we found that hornets are strongly attracted to the odor of some hive products, especially pollen and honey. When testing specific compounds, the honeybee aggregation pheromone, geraniol, proved highly attractive. Pheromones produced by honeybee larvae or by the queen were also of interest to hornet workers, albeit to a lesser extent. Our results indicate that V. velutina workers are selectively attracted towards olfactory cues from hives (stored food, brood, and queen), which may signal a high prey density.

While rapid transitions in tree communities are well documented across these variable soils, few studies have investigated the role of habitat heterogeneity in structuring animal communities. Stingless bees are taxonomically diverse and important natural pollinators in Neotropical forests. However, little is known about their community structuring at local scales in naturally heterogeneous environments. We systematically sampled stingless bee communities found across three paired sites that included adjacent patches of white-sand and non-white-sand forest in the lowland Amazonian region of Loreto, Peru. We sought to understand: (1) How stingless bee species richness and abundance differ among white-sand and non-white-sand habitats and (2) The relative influence of fine scale geographic distance and habitat type in structuring stingless bee communities. We found that species richness did not differ between habitats and that species abundances were highest in white-sand habitats. Community analyses for sampling sites pooled across all months demonstrated that location and soil type played a significant role in structuring bee communities and that community turnover may be more strongly influenced by distance in white-sand habitats than non-white sand habitats. Our results suggest that distance and habitat play an important role in driving stingless bee community turnover at fine scales and that the interaction between habitat and geographic distance may promote higher stingless bee community turnover in white-sand habitats than non-white sand habitats.",,,,"Rasmussen, Claus/X-4760-2019; Rasmussen, Claus/J-6714-2012; Kraichak, Ekaphan/D-5381-2018","Rasmussen, Claus/0000-0003-1529-6548; Kraichak, Ekaphan/0000-0002-8437-2180; Misiewicz, Tracy/0000-0002-2683-8405",,,,,,,,,,,,0361-6525,,,,,DEC,2014,61,4,,,,,407,414,,,,,,,,,WOS:000348602200009,,,,,

The objectives of this study were to verify the maximum distance that foragers of Melipona mandacaia Smith can fly, and whether experience is relevant for their homing ability in a Caatinga region of Northeast Brazil. Five colonies were used to collect foragers. These were marked and released starting from 100 m from their nests and at every 100 m up to a maximum distance on which there would be no bee returning to the nest. To evaluate the influence of experience, after being marked, another group of bees was put back into colonies, collected again after eight days and released in five distances only (500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 and 2,500 m). In both experiments, as the distance increased, the returning success of the bees decreased significantly. In fact, there was a significant negative correlation between their returning success and the distances they were released. The maximum distance a translocate bee returned to its hive was 2,700 m. The percentage of success was very high for bees released at 500 and 1,000 m (100% and 77%, respectively), suggesting this is the common flight range for the species.

In order to improve the current management methods for the species, this study aimed to describe the range of defensive strategies used by the stingless bee M. flavolineata towards inter and intraspecific chemical signals known to trigger defensive responses in related species, namely the head secretions of the robber bee Lestrimelitta limao (Smith) and the mandibular gland extract of conspecifics M. flavolineata workers. The stimuli provoked different defensive reactions. The head secretions of the robber bee repelled returning foragers, elicited the enclosing of the nest entrance tube with batumen balls and the agglomeration of workers outside the box. In contrast, the mandibular gland extract elicited aggression towards the pheromone deposition site, transport of resin and generalised agitated flights.

A number of stressors have been identified as potential contributing factors, including the extensive prophylactic use of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are highly toxic to bees, in agriculture. While multiple routes of exposure to these systemic insecticides have been documented for honey bees, contamination from puddle water has not been investigated. In this study, we used a multi-residue method based on LC-MS/MS to analyze samples of puddle water taken in the field during the planting of treated corn and one month later. If honey bees were to collect and drink water from these puddles, our results showed that they would be exposed to various agricultural pesticides. All water samples collected from corn fields were contaminated with at least one neonicotinoid compound, although most contained more than one systemic insecticide. Concentrations of neonicotinoids were higher in early spring, indicating that emission and drifting of contaminated dust during sowing raises contamination levels of puddles. Although the overall average acute risk of drinking water from puddles was relatively low, concentrations of neonicotinoids ranged from 0.01 to 63 mg/L and were sufficient to potentially elicit a wide array of sublethal effects in individuals and colony alike. Our results also suggest that risk assessment of honey bee water resources underestimates the foragers' exposure and consequently miscalculates the risk. In fact, our data shows that honey bees and native pollinators are facing unprecedented cumulative exposure to these insecticides from combined residues in pollen, nectar and water. These findings not only document the impact of this route of exposure for honey bees, they also have implications for the cultivation of a wide variety of crops for which the extensive use of neonicotinoids is currently promoted.",,,,"Serrano, Jose/A-2854-2009","Serrano, Jose/0000-0002-1565-5216",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Dec-01,2014,9,12,,,,,,,UNSP e108443,10.1371/journal.pone.0108443,,,,,,,WOS:000347114900004,25438051,,,,

We assembled a matrix of 309 morphological characters and 5246 aligned nucleotide positions from six nuclear genes (28S, EF-1a, wingless, POL2, LW-Rhodopsin, NAK). In addition to both constituent genera of Ancylaini, we include all three subtribes of the Eucerini as well as a large number of other tribes from the ""eucerine line"". The morphological data suggest Ancyla to be sister to Tarsalia + Eucerini and analyses of the entire molecular dataset suggest Tarsalia to be sister to Ancyla + Eucerini. However, analyses of the combined dataset suggests the Ancylaini to be monophyletic. We address possible bias within the molecular data and show that the base composition of two markers (EF-1a and NAK) is significantly heterogeneous among taxa and that this heterogeneity is strong enough to overcome the phylogenetic signal from the other markers. Analyses of a molecular matrix where the heterogeneous partitions have been RY-recoded yield trees that are better resolved and have higher nodal support values than those recovered in analyses of the non-recoded matrix, and strongly suggest the Ancylaini to be a monophyletic sister group to the Eucerini. A dated phylogeny and ancestral range reconstructions suggest that the common ancestor of the Ancylaini reached the Old World from the New World most probably via the Thulean Land Bridge in a time window between 69 and 47 mya, a period that includes the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum. No further exchanges between the New World and the Old World are implied by our data until the period between 22 mya and 13.9 mya. These more recent faunal exchanges probably involved geodispersal over the Bering Land Bridge by less thermophilic lineages. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Systemic insecticides are recognized as one of the drivers of worldwide honey and wild bee declines. Particularly honeybees in agricultural environments are exposed to pesticides when they collect crop pollen and nectar. However, landscape scale studies which analyze pollen use and foraging distances of honey bees on mass-flowering crops like maize to evaluate potential exposure risks are currently lacking. In an experimental approach on a landscape scale we took advantage of intra-colonial dance communication to gather information about the location of utilized pollen resources. During maize flowering, four observation hives were placed in and rotated between 11 different landscapes which covered a gradient from low to high maize acreage. A higher frequency of dances for foraging locations on maize fields compared to other land use types shows that maize is an intensively used pollen resource for honey bee colonies. Mean foraging distances were significantly shorter for maize pollen than for other pollen origins. The percentage of maize pollen foragers did not increase with maize acreage in the landscape. The proportion of grassland area providing alternative pollen sources did not reduce the percentage of maize pollen foragers. Our findings allow estimating the distance-related exposure risk of honey bee colonies to pollen from surrounding maize fields treated with systemic insecticides. Similarly, the results can be used to estimate the exposure to transgenic maize pollen, which is relevant for honey production in European countries. Provision of alternative pollen resources within agri-environmental schemes could potentially reduce exposure risk to pesticide contaminated crop pollen. (C) 2014 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

Patellapis doleritica is a recently described communally nesting halictid bee of conservation concern because it is rare and endemic to the Succulent Karoo of South Africa. Moreover, its dispersal is considered to be restricted by its specialised nesting requirements and inclement weather conditions during its limited annual flight period, traits which may be common to other bee species of the region. We hypothesised that gene flow in P. doleritica was low, leading to marked genetic differentiation. Using 7 microsatellites, we investigated its mating and population genetic structure in 258 individuals (171 females and 87 males) from 7 populations spanning most of its known range. Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (F-IS = + 0.254) suggested P. doleritica to be inbred, as in many other communal nesting bee species. Global F-ST (0.028) and global G'(ST) (0.216) revealed modest but significant differentiation between most populations, even across the very limited range of the species (ca. 25 km), with one genetically extreme outlier population. Despite inbreeding, we detected a surprisingly low frequency of diploid males (2 %).

A current frontier in community-level studies is the integration of these perspectives by investigating both simultaneously; one method for achieving this is evaluating the relative contributions of species turnover and host switching towards interaction turnover (i.e., the dissimilarity in interactions between two networks). We performed observations of plant-pollinator interactions to investigate (1) patterns in interaction turnover across spatial, temporal, and environmental gradients and (2) the relative contribution of pollinator species turnover, floral turnover, simultaneous pollinator & floral turnover, and host switching towards interaction turnover. Field work was conducted on the Beartooth Plateau, an alpine ecosystem in Montana and Wyoming, with weekly observations of plant-pollinator interactions across one growing season. Interaction turnover increased through time, with magnitudes consistently greater than 80%, even at time intervals as short as one week. Floral species turnover (41%) and simultaneous floral and pollinator species turnover (36%) accounted for almost all interaction turnover while host switching accounted for only 5%. Interaction turnover also significantly increased with spatial and elevational distance, albeit with lesser magnitudes than with temporal distance. The marginal spatial pattern was present for only some taxa (Bombus spp. and solitary bee species), potentially indicating variable habitat use by pollinators across the landscape. Weak environmental trends may be a consequence of unmeasured environmental variables, yet our finding that environmental gradients structure plant-pollinator interaction partitions had not previously been tested with empirical data. Our observations suggest that host switching does not readily occur at the scales of alpine flowering phenology (i.e., similar to 1 week); however, whether lack of host switching is indicative of inflexible pollinator foraging, or, more likely, a lack of opportunity or necessity to switch hosts, requires further investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,NOV,2014,5,11,,,,,,,149,10.1890/ES14-00323.1,,,,,,,WOS:000346491100009,,,,,

This is typically because distributions of straight line distances between consecutive significant turns in movement paths have heavy power law tails. This diagnostic tool has been called into question because there is currently no standard, unambiguous way to identify significant turns. Even if such a way could be found, statistical analyses based on significant turns cannot account for actual movements made between turns and as a consequence cannot distinguish between true Levy walks and other fractal random walks such as Levy modulated correlated random walks where organisms randomly meander rather than move in straight lines between consecutive reorientation events. Here, I show that structure functions (i.e. moments of net displacements made across fixed time intervals) can distinguish between different kinds of Levy walks and between Levy walks and random walks with a few scales such as composite correlated random walks and correlated random walks. Distinguishing between these processes will lead to a better understanding of how and why animals perform Levy walks and help bridge the apparent divide between correlated random walks and Levy walks. Structure functions do not require turn identification and instead take account of entire movement paths. Using this diagnostic tool, I bolster previous claims that honeybees use a movement strategy that can be approximated by Levy walks when searching for their hive.

Pollinator nutrition is dependent on floral resources (i.e., nectar and pollen), which are linked to landscape composition. Here, we present a stratified analysis of the nutritional composition of beebread in managed honeybee hives with a view to examining potential sources of variation in its nutritional composition. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that beebread composition correlates with local land use and therefore available floral resources. The results demonstrated that the starch, lipid, and moisture contents of beebread are all highly conserved across hives, whereas levels of protein and nonreducing sugar increased as the year progressed, reducing sugars, however, decreased during the first half of the year and then increased toward the end. Local land use around hives was quantified using data from the Countryside Survey 2007 Land Cover Map. Bee-bread protein content was negatively correlated with increasing levels of arable and horticultural farmland surrounding hives and positively correlated with the cover of natural grasslands and broadleaf woodlands. Reducing sugar content was also positively correlated with the amount of broad-leaved woodland in a 3Km(2) radius from the hives. Previous studies on a range of invertebrates, including honeybees, indicate that dietary protein intake may have a major impact on correlates of fitness, including longevity and immune function.

The flowering phenology of a plant genotype determines its expected daily floral display which, together with pollinator behavior, governs the population rate of geitonogamous selfing (fertilization among flowers on the same plant). Pollinators select plant phenologies in two ways: they are more likely to visit plants displaying more flowers per day, and they influence geitonogamous selfing and consequent inbreeding depression via their abundance, foraging behavior, and pollen carry-over among flowers on a plant. Our model predicts two types of equilibria at stable intermediate selfing rates for a wide range of pollinator behaviors and pollen transfer parameters. Edge equilibria occur at maximal or minimal selfing rates and are constrained by pollinators. Internal equilibria occur between edge equilibria and are determined by a trade-off between pollinator attraction to large floral displays and avoidance of inbreeding depression due to selfing.

Samples of honey, beeswax, pollen, and nectar were regularly collected, and samples were analyzed for clothianidin residues. Several of these endpoints were also measured in spring 2013. Overall, colonies were vigorous during and after the exposure period, and we found no effects of exposure to clothianidin seed-treated canola on any endpoint measures. Bees foraged heavily on the test fields during peak bloom and residue analysis indicated that honey bees were exposed to low levels (0.5-2 ppb) of clothianidin in pollen. Low levels of clothianidin were detected in a few pollen samples collected toward the end of the bloom from control hives, illustrating the difficulty of conducting a perfectly controlled field study with free-ranging honey bees in agricultural landscapes. Overwintering success did not differ significantly between treatment and control hives, and was similar to overwintering colony loss rates reported for the winter of 2012-2013 for beekeepers in Ontario and Canada. Our results suggest that exposure to canola grown from seed treated with clothianidin poses low risk to honey bees.",,,,"Serrano, Jose/A-2854-2009","Serrano, Jose/0000-0002-1565-5216",,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,Oct-30,2014,2,,,,,,,,e652,10.7717/peerj.652,,,,,,,WOS:000347624600007,25374790,,,,

Rice is one of the most important crops in the world. Several transgenic varieties of rice have been developed, and some have recently entered pre-production trials. One concern with genetically modified (GM) crops is transgene escape, but prior studies suggest this risk is low for rice because it is self-pollinated and the dispersal of pollen by wind is limited. 2. Little is known about the impact of pollen transport by insects. We characterized the insects visiting rice plants during anthesis and considered the effects of insect pollination on gene flow. 3. We conducted a 2-year nationwide survey in China and identified more than 510 insect species that visited rice flowers. Honeybees, hoverflies and several other species carried large amounts of pollen. The European honeybee Apis mellifera visited rice flowers regularly with daily foraging activity peaking between 12.00 and 13.00 h. 4. We monitored 20 European honeybee colonies located 100-1000 metres away from rice fields in mixed agricultural landscapes and found the honeybees carried viable pollen at least 500 m away from the rice pollen source. 5. We used four GM rice lines as pollen donors, their non-GM parental varieties as pollen recipients and the European honeybee as the pollinator in field-cage experiments to assess whether honeybees increase the frequency of gene flow in rice. Results from screening over 1.5 million germinated offspring seeds over a 3-year study period showed that honeybees significantly increase transgene flow in rice. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that a remarkably high diversity of insects visit rice flowers in China and that hundreds of species including honeybees carry large amounts of rice pollen. European honeybees carry viable pollen over long distances, forage on rice flowers regularly and increase the frequency of transgene flow. Insects mediate gene flow in rice more than previously assumed, and this should be taken into consideration during the ecological risk assessment of transgene flow in self-pollinated and/or anemophilous crops.",,,,"Chen, Xue-xin/D-1592-2010","Chen, Xue-xin/0000-0002-9109-8853",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,OCT,2014,51,5,,,,,1357,1365,,10.1111/1365-2664.12299,,,,,,,WOS:000342851300025,,,,,

This algorithm has been successfully used as an optimization tool in combinatorial and functional optimization fields. In addition, its behavior very closely mimics the actual behavior that occurs in nature, and it is very simple and easy to implement. However, its convergence speed to the optimal solution still needs further improvement and it also needs a mechanism to obviate getting trapped in local optima. In this paper, a novel initialization algorithm based on the patch concept and Levy flight distribution is proposed to initialize the population of bees in BA. Consequently, we incorporate this initialization procedure into a proposed enhanced BA variant. The proposed variant is more natural than conventional variants of BA. It mimics the patch environment in nature and Levy flight, which is believed to characterize the foraging patterns of bees in nature. The results of experiments conducted on several widely used high-dimensional benchmarks indicate that our proposed enhanced BA variant significantly outperforms other BA variants and state-of-the-art variants of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, and success rate. In addition, the results of experimental analyses conducted indicate that our proposed enhanced BA is very stable, has the ability to deal with differences in search ranges, and rapidly converges without getting stuck in local optima.

Schedules for applications of the miticide that could maintain low mite levels were tested in hives started from either package bees or splits of larger colonies. The schedules were developed based on defined parameters for efficacy of the miticide and predictions of varroa population growth generated from a mathematical model of honey bee colony-varroa population dynamics. Colonies started from package bees and treated with HG in the package only or with subsequent HG treatments in the summer had 1.2-2.1 mites per 100 bees in August. Untreated controls averaged significantly more mites than treated colonies (3.3 mites per 100 bees). By October, mite populations ranged from 6.3 to 15.0 mites per 100 bees with the lowest mite numbers in colonies treated with HG in August. HG applications in colonies started from splits in April reduced mite populations to 0.12 mites per 100 bees. In September, the treated colonies had significantly fewer mites than the untreated controls. Subsequent HG applications in September that lasted for 3 weeks reduced mite populations to levels in November that were significantly lower than in colonies that were untreated or had an HG treatment that lasted for 1 week.

Floral neighbors can modify the quantity of pollinator visits to a focal species but may also influence the composition of visitor assemblages that plants receive leading to potential changes in the average effectiveness of floral visits. We explored how the heterospecific floral neighborhood (abundance of native and non-native heterospecific plants within 2 m x 2 m) affects pollinator visitation and composition of pollinator assemblages for a native plant, Phacelia parryi. The relative effectiveness of different insect visitors was also assessed to interpret the potential effects on plant fitness of shifts in pollinator assemblage composition. Although the common non-native Brassica nigra did not have a significant effect on overall pollinator visitation rate to P. parryi, the proportion of flower visits that were made by native pollinators increased with increasing abundance of heterospecific plant species in the floral neighborhood other than B. nigra. Furthermore, native pollinators deposited twice as many P. parryi pollen grains per visit as did the nonnative Apis mellifera, and visits by native bees also resulted in more seeds than visits by A. mellifera. These results indicate that the floral neighborhood can influence the composition of pollinator assemblages that visit a native plant and that changes in local flower communities have the potential to affect plant reproductive success through shifts in these assemblages towards less effective pollinators.",,,,"Campbell, Diane/A-1653-2012","Campbell, Diane/0000-0002-1147-846X",,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,OCT,2014,176,2,,,,,465,476,,10.1007/s00442-014-3023-6,,,,,,,WOS:000342205600015,25047026,,,,

The sub-lethal impact of GLY on non-target organisms such as insect pollinators has not yet been evaluated. Apis mellifera is the main pollinator in agricultural environments and is a well-known model for behavioural research. Honeybees are also accurate biosensors of environmental pollutants and their appetitive behavioural response is a suitable tool with which to test sub-lethal effects of agrochemicals. We studied the effects of field-realistic doses of GLY on honeybees exposed chronically or acutely to the herbicide. We focused on sucrose sensitivity, elemental and non-elemental associative olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER), and foraging-related behaviour. We found a reduced sensitivity to sucrose and learning performance for the groups chronically exposed to GLY concentrations within the range of recommended doses. When olfactory PER conditioning was performed with sucrose reward with the same GLY concentrations (acute exposure), elemental learning and short-term memory retention decreased significantly compared with controls. Non-elemental associative learning was also impaired by an acute exposure to GLY traces. Altogether, these results imply that GLY at concentrations found in agro-ecosystems as a result of standard spraying can reduce sensitivity to nectar reward and impair associative learning in honeybees. However, no effect on foraging-related behaviour was found. Therefore, we speculate that successful forager bees could become a source of constant inflow of nectar with GLY traces that could then be distributed among nestmates, stored in the hive and have long-term negative consequences on colony performance.",,,,,"Vazquez, Diego Eduardo/0000-0003-1303-590X",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,OCT,2014,217,19,,,,,3457,3464,,10.1242/jeb.109520,,,,,,,WOS:000342506700016,25063858,,,,

Investigating the ecology of species with expanding ranges provides a potentially powerful means of elucidating these factors. Such species may also bring novel pollination services to their new ranges. We therefore investigated landscape-scale habitat use and foraging preferences of the Tree Bumblebee, B. hypnorum, a recent natural colonist that has rapidly expanded its range in the UK over the past decade. Counts of B. hypnorum and six other Bombus species were made in March-June 2012 within a mixed landscape in south-eastern Norfolk, UK. The extent of different landscape elements around each transect was quantified at three scales (250 m, 500 m and 1500 m). We then identified the landscape elements that best predicted the density of B. hypnorum and other Bombus species. At the best fitting scale (250 m), B. hypnorum density was significantly positively associated with extent of both urban and woodland cover and significantly negatively associated with extent of oilseed rape cover. This combination of landscape predictors was unique to B. hypnorum. Urban and woodland cover were associated with B. hypnorum density at three and two, respectively, of the three scales studied. Relative to other Bombus species, B. hypnorum exhibited a significantly higher foraging preference for two flowering trees, Crataegus monogyna and Prunus spinosa, and significantly lower preferences for Brassica napus, Glechoma hederacea and Lamium album. Our study provides novel, quantitative support for an association of B. hypnorum with urban and woodland landscape elements. Range expansion in B. hypnorum appears to depend, on exploitation of widespread habitats underutilised by native Bombus species, suggesting B. hypnorum will readily co-exist with these species. These findings suggest that management could target bumblebee species with distinctive habitat requirements to help maintain pollination services.",,,,"Bourke, Andrew/E-5271-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Sep-26,2014,9,9,,,,,,,e107568,10.1371/journal.pone.0107568,,,,,,,WOS:000342685600022,25259579,,,,

Additionally, suites of behavioural traits are often correlated, forming behavioural syndromes in both humans and other species. Such syndromes are often described by testing for variation in traits across commonly described dimensions (e. g. aggression and neophobia), independent of whether this variation is ecologically relevant to the focal species. Here, we use a variety of ecologically relevant behavioural traits to test for a colony-level behavioural syndrome in rock ants (Temnothorax rugatulus). Specifically, we combine field and laboratory assays to measure foraging effort, how colonies respond to different types of resources, activity level, response to threat and aggression level. We find evidence for a colony level syndrome that suggests colonies consistently differ in coping style-some are more risk-prone, whereas others are more risk-averse.

We detected live P. syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), a pathogen of kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.), on caged bees in hives 6 days after the bees were inoculated with Psa, and recorded up to 1.8 x 10(4) colony forming units of Psa on honey bees foraging naturally on flowers of Psa-infected vines. P. syringae pv. syringae (PssSmr), a pathogen with a wide host range, was spread to untreated bees in a hive within 24 h following the introduction of foragers doused in PssSmr-contaminated pollen and was still detected on bees 9 days later. PssSmr was found on caged bees in hives 6 d after they were inoculated and PssSmr survived in hives for at least 14 days.

Whilst there is appreciable variation in the cognitive performance of animals, we know surprisingly little about the extent to which learning varies among individuals across different sensory modalities. Do individuals that are good at learning in one sensory modality also perform well in another (performance is correlated between modalities), or do individuals demonstrate specialisation in learning performance in one modality (trading-off performance between modalities)? We tested these hypotheses by examining the performance of 76 Bombus terrestris workers, from four colonies, in both an odour-and visual learning task. Olfactory learning was assessed using proboscis extension reflex (PER) conditioning and visual (colour) learning was examined using a well-established free-flying paradigm. Our results showed neither a correlation, nor a trade-off, in individual performance for learning tasks using different sensory modalities. However, there was considerable variation among workers within each colony in their performance in both learning tasks. This extent of interindividual variation in learning ability across sensory modalities could be adaptive for colonies dealing with changeable foraging conditions. There was also significant intercolony variation in final task performance level in the olfactory learning task, and both the strength and persistence of blue preference in the colour learning task. This is the first study to demonstrate variation in olfactory learning performance across multiple bumblebee colonies using PER conditioning, suggesting this is an effective paradigm for assessing associative olfactory learning performance both within and among colonies.",,,,,"Raine, Nigel/0000-0001-6343-2829",,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,1432-0762,,,,SEP,2014,68,9,,,,,1549,1559,,10.1007/s00265-014-1765-0,,,,,,,WOS:000340586200016,,,,,

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Epipactis palustris (L.) Crantz that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. 2. Epipactis palustris is native to Britain, being widely distributed throughout England and Wales, but is less common in the north. Although absent from most of Scotland, it occurs as far north as Perthshire. It is widely distributed in Ireland. The species extends throughout most of Europe, occurring as far east as Mongolia and the north of Turkey, but it is absent from the southern Mediterranean region. 3. Epipactis palustris grows mainly in full sunlight, rarely under shade, and on calcareous, but nutrient-poor, moist to wet substrates. It favours flushed or seasonally inundated areas in which the intensity of competition from other vegetation is low. It is most commonly found in wet dune slacks, calcareous fens and on peat, but it also occurs on sandy substrates overlying heavy clay or loamy soils. Occasionally, it can also be found near the top of slopes in chalk downland. 4. Epipactis palustris multiplies both by vegetative propagation and sexual reproduction. Vegetative propagation involves the production of regularly branched rhizomes. It flowers in Britain from the end of June until the beginning of September. The flowers produce nectar, which is often colonized by bacteria and to a lesser extent by yeasts. The species is pollinated by a wide range of insects, including honeybees, flies, wasps, beetles, bumblebees and ants, but is also capable of limited spontaneous autogamy. The most efficient pollinators are small bees and solitary wasps. Fruit production is generally high (>80% of the flowers produce capsules). 5. Epipactis palustris is vulnerable to changes in soil water level and to substrate nutrient enrichment. It has suffered a strong decline in its distribution range in Britain, with most losses of local populations occurring before 1930. Habitat destruction and drainage of marshes and fens appear to be the most common causes for the decline of the species. Restoration of old wet dune slacks by topsoil removal and addition of hay from neighbouring vegetation has been successful in encouraging colonization and establishment of populations of the species within a few years. Cessation of draining of mires may also promote the long-term survival of populations of the species.",,,,"Jacquemyn, Hans/AAC-4875-2019","Jacquemyn, Hans/0000-0001-9600-5794",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,SEP,2014,102,5,,,,,1341,1355,,10.1111/1365-2745.12287,,,,,,,WOS:000340681300024,,,,,

Experiments conducted in lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) fields indicated that home-made wooden, Koppert, and Enviroquest dispensers had no significant effects on foraging behavior or pollen loads of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens, but the presence of a dispenser did reduce the rate of workers exiting hives. Following exit of bees from dispensers, no difference was found in the quantity of the microbial agent Clonostachys rosea applied to the bees or blossoms, and distribution of product in the field was not influenced by dispenser design or distance from hives. However, the prevalence of the pathogen Botrytis cinerea in blossoms from cages that contained hives with dispensers with C. rosea was significantly less (10-20 %) than blossom infection in control plots, despite unseasonably inclement conditions and restricted foraging. These results suggest that C. rosea can be effectively delivered by commercial bumble bees for prevention of B. cinerea infection in V. angustifolium, but the efficacy of the technique will be limited during periods of poor weather that often occur in regions where lowbush blueberries are grown.

The proposed M(2)OBA extend original artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to multi-objective and cooperative mode by combining external archive, comprehensive learning, greedy selection, crowding distance, and cooperative search strategy. Our algorithm uses the concept of Pareto dominance and comprehensive learning mechanism to determine the flight direction of a bee and maintains nondominated solution vectors in external archive based on greedy selection and crowing distance strategies. With cooperative search approaches, the single population ABC has been extended to interacting multi-hive model by constructing colony-level interaction topology and information exchange strategies. With six mathematical benchmark functions, M(2)OBA is proved to have significantly better performance than three successful multi-objective optimizers, namely the fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), the multi-objective particle swarm optimizer (MOPSO), and the multi-objective ABC (MOABC), for solving complex multi-objective optimization problems. M2OBA is then used for solving the real-world OPF problem that considers the cost, loss, and emission impacts as the objective functions. The 30-bus IEEE test system is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results, which are also compared to NSGA-II, MOPSO, and MOABC, are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These induded pollen from corn and cotton, nectar from cotton, flowers from soybean, honey bees, Apis mellifera L., and pollen carried by foragers returning to hives, preplanting and in-season soil samples, and wild flowers adjacent to recently planted fields. Neonicotinoid insecticides were detected at a level of 1 ng/g or above in 23% of wild flower samples around recently planted fields, with an average detection level of about 10 ng/g. We detected neonicotinoid insecticides in the soil of production fields prior to planting at an average concentration of about 10 ng/g, and over 80% of the samples having some insecticide present. Only 5% of foraging honey bees tested positive for the presence of neonicotinoid insecticides, and there was only one trace detection (< 1 ng/g) in pollen being carried by those bees. Soybean flowers, cotton pollen, and cotton nectar contained little or no neonicotinoids resulting from insecticide seed treatments. Average levels of neonicotinoid insecticides in corn pollen ranged from less than 1 to 6 ng/g.

Habitat destruction and fragmentation associated with urbanization are reported as part of the main causes of this decline. Urbanization involves dramatic changes of the landscape, increasing the proportion of impervious surface while decreasing that of green areas. Few studies have investigated the effects of urbanization on bee communities. We assessed changes in the abundance, species richness, and composition of wild bee community along an urbanization gradient. Methodology/Principal Findings: Over two years and on a monthly basis, bees were sampled with colored pan traps and insect nets at 24 sites located along an urbanization gradient. Landscape structure within three different radii was measured at each study site. We captured 291 wild bee species. The abundance of wild bees was negatively correlated with the proportion of impervious surface, while species richness reached a maximum at an intermediate (50%) proportion of impervious surface. The structure of the community changed along the urbanization gradient with more parasitic species in sites with an intermediate proportion of impervious surface. There were also greater numbers of cavity-nesting species and long-tongued species in sites with intermediate or higher proportion of impervious surface. However, urbanization had no effect on the occurrence of species depending on their social behavior or body size. Conclusions/Significance: We found nearly a third of the wild bee fauna known from France in our study sites. Indeed, urban areas supported a diverse bee community, but sites with an intermediate level of urbanization were the most speciose ones, including greater proportion of parasitic species. The presence of a diverse array of bee species even in the most urbanized area makes these pollinators worthy of being a flagship group to raise the awareness of urban citizens about biodiversity.",,,,"Rollin, Orianne/R-9705-2019","Rollin, Orianne/0000-0002-1455-9302",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Aug-13,2014,9,8,,,,,,,e104679,10.1371/journal.pone.0104679,,,,,,,WOS:000340900600077,25118722,,,,

Colour patterns on flowers can increase pollinator visitation and enhance foraging behaviour. Flowers uniform in colour to humans, however, can appear patterned to insects due to spatial variation in UV reflectance on petals. A UV 'bullseye' pattern that is common among angiosperms - UV-absorbing petal bases and UV-reflective apices - purportedly functions as a nectar guide, enhancing pollinator orientation and experimental evidence suggests that UV reflectance increases floral apparency to pollinators. 2. We test the pollinator-attracting and pollinator-orienting functions of floral UV pattern and UV reflectance under natural conditions. Specifically, we address whether UV reflection alone, or UV pattern influences small bee and syrphid fly attraction rates (approaching, landing and foraging visits), foraging rates, and likelihood of foraging and orienting to the centre of flowers, using Argentina anserina, a species whose flowers exhibit variability in the size of the UV bullseye. We manipulated UV properties while maintaining uniformly yellow petals to create three phenotypes - uniformly UV-absorptive, uniformly UV-reflective, and inversed bullseye (reflective bases and absorptive apices) and compared insect visitation and behaviour to control flowers with the common UV bullseye phenotype. 3. The presence of UV pattern increased attraction rates by both bees and syrphid flies relative to either fully UV reflective or absorptive flowers. However, only in the inverse array did the bullseye phenotype elicit higher foraging rates than the test flower. Neither the presence of pattern, nor the reversal of the common pattern influenced the likelihood of pollinator foraging or orientating to the flowers' centre during a visit. 4. We provide some of the first evidence to suggest that flowers with spatial variation in UV reflectance may be more conspicuous to insects than those with petals that uniformly absorb or reflect UV, all of which are naturally occurring phenotypes. Further, we verify that the most common UV pattern in nature increases insect attraction and foraging rate relative to the inverse pattern. Results confirm a distance apparency function of the UV bullseye, but we argue for reconsideration of the notion that pollinators benefit from this ubiquitous floral motif through enhanced foraging efficiency.",,,,"Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,AUG,2014,28,4,,,,,868,877,,10.1111/1365-2435.12242,,,,,,,WOS:000340673900009,,,,,

Our understanding of the histories behind the biodiverse south west Pacific (SWP) archipelagos is limited, and further impeded by the complex geological histories of this region. Previous studies of the SWP short-tongued halictine bee fauna suggest their presence is much younger than the geological ages of these archipelagos, which is surprising given their critical role as pollinators in other terrestrial ecosystems. The long-tongued megachilid bees represent a considerable proportion of the known bee species for the region, yet little is known of their origin. Here we use genetic diversity within mitochondrial DNA to infer the likely ages and origins of megachilid species from Vanuatu, Fiji, and Samoa. Our results indicate a very recent origin for megachilids in the SWP, with many species exhibiting small intraspecific genetic distances.

The type of biofuel crop selected for production has the capacity to substantially alter landscape composition, affecting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. To understand how increasing production of perennial grasses for biofuels may affect pollinators and pollination services, we identified 20 agricultural fields that varied in their proportion of surrounding grassland cover. Bees and pollination services were measured at each site to determine how bee abundance, diversity, and community composition responded to increasing proportions of grassland, and to quantify how pollination services changed as the proportion of grassland increased in the landscape. Bees were collected from sentinel sunflowers, and pollination services were measured by comparing seed set from open and closed sunflowers at each site. Landscape composition had a significant effect on bee abundance, diversity, and community composition with a greater abundance of bees and a more diverse bee community found visiting flowers at sites with more of the surrounding landscape in perennial grassland. In contrast, the bee community in low grassland sites was dominated by Apis mellifera, suggesting that pollination in these landscapes may be more sensitive to declines in this species. Despite these differences, the level of sunflower pollination was similar across sites, even though the bee community responded to changes in landscape composition. Increasing grassland cover through the addition of perennial biofuel plantings would be expected to support a more diverse bee community and a greater abundance of bees, yielding reliable pollination services.

Unravelling the complex dance language of honeybees,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,,,,,,,,,,,,"The honeybees' (genus Apis) waggle dance is the only known example of a symbolic language in a nonprimate species. Through a complex series of stereotyped movements, a bee returning from a foraging trip can indicate to her nestmates the direction, distance and quality of a nectar, pollen or nest resource she has located. The 'waggle' component of the dance (indicating directional information) contains an inherent error and this error becomes smaller the further the site danced for. The imprecision in the dance effectively spreads dance followers over a patch that remains relatively constant with increasing distance to a resource. This error has been proposed to be a colony-level adaptation and to confer an advantage in the context of foraging. An alternative explanation for the error in the bees' dance is that the bees simply cannot be more precise due to constraints inherent to the dance. Here we analyse all studies to date that have investigated the bees' dance error. We conclude that the error in the honeybee waggle dance is nonadaptive and that the bees dance as best they can.

Here, we review the available literature on insect telemetry using active (battery-powered) radio transmitters and compare this technology to harmonic radar and radio frequency identification (RFID) which use passive tags (i.e. without a battery). The first radio telemetry studies with insects were published in the late 1980s, and subsequent studies have addressed aspects of insect ecology, behaviour and evolution. Most insect telemetry studies have focused on habitat use and movement, including quantification of movement paths, home range sizes, habitat selection, and movement distances. Fewer studies have addressed foraging behaviour, activity patterns, migratory strategies, or evolutionary aspects. The majority of radio telemetry studies have been conducted outside the tropics, usually with beetles (Coleoptera) and crickets (Orthoptera), but bees (Hymenoptera), dobsonflies (Megaloptera), and dragonflies (Odonata) have also been radio-tracked. In contrast to the active transmitters used in radio telemetry, the much lower weight of harmonic radar and RFID tags allows them to be used with a broader range of insect taxa. However, the fixed detection zone of a stationary radar unit (< 1 km diameter) and the restricted detection distance of RFID tags (usually < 1-5 m) constitute major constraints of these technologies compared to radio telemetry. Most of the active transmitters in radio telemetry have been applied to insects with a body mass exceeding 1 g, but smaller species in the range 0.2-0.5 g (e. g. bumblebees and orchid bees) have now also been tracked. Current challenges of radio-tracking insects in the field are related to the constraints of a small transmitter, including short battery life (7-21 days), limited tracking range on the ground (100-500 m), and a transmitter weight that sometimes approaches the weight of a given insect (the ratio of tag mass to body mass varies from 2 to 100%). The attachment of radio transmitters may constrain insect behaviour and incur significant energetic costs, but few studies have addressed this in detail. Future radio telemetry studies should address (i) a larger number of species from different insect families and functional groups, (ii) a better coverage of tropical regions, (iii) intraspecific variability between sexes, ages, castes, and individuals, and (iv) a larger tracking range via aerial surveys with helicopters and aeroplanes equipped with external antennae. Furthermore, field and laboratory studies, including observational and experimental approaches as well as theoretical modelling, could help to clarify the behavioural and energetic consequences of transmitter attachment. Finally, the development of commercially available systems for automated tracking and potential future options of insect telemetry from space will provide exciting new avenues for quantifying movement and space use of insects from local to global spatial scales.",,,,"Pattemore, David/G-1269-2018; Hagen, Melanie/I-7939-2013","Pattemore, David/0000-0003-4609-2660; ",,,,,,,,,,,,1464-7931,1469-185X,,,,AUG,2014,89,3,,,,,511,530,,10.1111/brv.12065,,,,,,,WOS:000339562900001,24106908,,,,

It is becoming increasingly popular, in places such as North America and some European countries, to engage members of the general public and school pupils in the collection of scientific data to support long-term environmental monitoring. Participants in such schemes are generally volunteers and are referred to as citizen scientists. The Christmas bird count in the US is one of the worlds longest running citizen science projects whereby volunteers have been collecting data on birds on a specific day since 1900. Similar volunteer networks in Ireland have been in existence since the 1960s and were established to monitor the number and diversity of birds throughout the country. More recently, initiatives such as Greenwave (2006) and Nature Watch (2009) invite school children and members of the general public respectively, to record phenology data from a range of common species of plant, insect and bird. In addition, the Irish butterfly and bumblebee monitoring schemes engage volunteers to record data on sightings of these species. The primary purpose of all of these networks is to collect data by which to monitor changes in wildlife development and diversity, and in the case of Greenwave to involve children in hands-on, inquiry-based science. Together these various networks help raise awareness of key environmental issues, such as climate change and loss of biodiversity, while at the same time promote development of scientific skills among the general population. In addition, they provide valuable scientific data by which to track environmental change. Here we examine the role of citizen science in monitoring biodiversity in Ireland and conclude that some of the data collected in these networks can be used to fulfil Ireland's statutory obligations for nature conservation. In addition, a bee thought previously to be extinct has been rediscovered and a range expansion of a different bee has been confirmed. However, it also became apparent that some of the networks play more of an educational than a scientific role.

One explanation for flower constancy is that pollinators use the search image of a specific flower type to efficiently find flowers because they are often cryptic. The so-called search image hypothesis predicts that temporal specialization to 1 flower type by an individual pollinator declines as flower conspicuousness increases because if flowers are conspicuous, pollinators can divide their attention among different flower types. To test this prediction, we investigated visitation sequences of individual bumble bees (Bombus ignitus) to a patch of blue and yellow artificial flowers. We used different flower sizes and interflower distances as independent determinants of flower visual size and noisiness of the background and, thus, of flower crypsis. Flower color selectivity and flower search time decreased and subsequently increased with visual size of the nearest flowers, with a minimum of approximately 15 degrees of the visual angle. Within-bout constancy, measured as the tendency of flying to the same flower types in succession compared with the expectation of a given flower selectivity within a bout, increased with visual size of the nearest flowers. Flower selectivity and within-bout constancy did not differ among arrays that shared the same floral visual angle, indicating that visual size, rather than flight distance or flower size itself, had a substantial effect on flower choices.

Therefore, we conclude that migrating bee-eaters compensated for crosswind during their spring migration and that this response was not dependent on bird flight mode.",,,,"Sapir, Nir/V-9634-2019; Nathan, Ran/A-9380-2008","Sapir, Nir/0000-0002-2477-0515; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8375,1439-0361,,,,JUL,2014,155,3,,,,,745,753,,10.1007/s10336-014-1060-x,,,,,,,WOS:000337792500019,,,,,

Very few studies have investigated the effects of nectar robbing on the behaviour of legitimate pollinators so far. Such behavioural changes may lead to the reduction of geitonogamy or to increased pollen movement. We simulated nectar robbing in experimental sites as well as in natural populations of Aconitum napellus ssp. lusitanicum, a rare plant pollinated by long-tongued bumblebees. In an experimental setup, we removed the nectaries of 40 % of the flowers, which is similar to rates of robbing observed in wild populations. Patches of plants with experimentally robbed flowers were compared with control patches containing plants with untreated flowers. We observed pollinator behaviour, mimicked male reproductive success (pollen dispersal) using fluorescent dye, and measured female reproductive success (seed set). The main legitimate visitors were bumblebees while honeybees were often observed robbing nectar. They did so by ""base working"", i.e. sliding between tepals. Bumblebees tended to visit fewer flowers per plant and spent less time per single flower when these had been experimentally robbed. This change in behaviour consequently increased the proportion of flowers visited by bumblebees in patches with robbed flowers. Fluorescent dye mimicking pollen flow was dispersed larger distances after pollinators had visited patches with robbed flowers compared to control patches. Average seed set per plant was not affected by nectar robbing. Our results demonstrated that A. napellus does not suffer from nectar robbery but may rather benefit via improved pollen dispersal and thus, male reproductive success. Knowledge on such combined effects of behavioural changes of pollinators due to nectar robbery is important to understand the evolutionary significance of exploiters of such mutualistic relationships between plants and their pollinators.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-7653,1573-8477,,,,JUL,2014,28,4,,,,,669,685,,10.1007/s10682-014-9696-9,,,,,,,WOS:000336978700006,,,,,

Tetragonula carbonaria showed consistently higher flight activity (resulting in a higher sugar intake per minute) and thus likely collected more resin and more pollen from a broader plant spectrum than A. australis. In contrast, the smaller A. australis colonies tended to collect a narrower resource spectrum and focused on high-quality resources (i.e., nectar of significantly higher sugar concentrations). Tetragonula carbonaria colonies also gained more weight over the study period than A. australis colonies, but colony growth may nevertheless be similar between the two species, albeit resulting from differences in resource allocation and exploitation as well as worker lifespan.

The approach comprised 2 stages. In the first stage, honeybee colonies were exposed to a commercial formulation of glyphosate applied to flowering Phacelia tanacetifolia with glyphosate residues quantified in relevant matrices (pollen and nectar) collected by foraging bees on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 postapplication and glyphosate levels in larvae were measured on days 4 and 7. Glyphosate levels in pollen were approximately 10 times higher than in nectar and glyphosate demonstrated rapid decline in both matrices. Residue data along with foraging rates and food requirements of the colony were then used to set dose rates in the effects study. In the second stage, the toxicity of technical glyphosate to developing honeybee larvae and pupae, and residues in larvae, were then determined by feeding treated sucrose directly to honeybee colonies at dose rates that reflect worst-case exposure scenarios. There were no significant effects from glyphosate observed in brood survival, development, and mean pupal weight. Additionally, there were no biologically significant levels of adult mortality observed in any glyphosate treatment group. Significant effects were observed only in the fenoxycarb toxic reference group and included increased brood mortality and a decline in the numbers of bees and brood. Mean glyphosate residues in larvae were comparable at 4 days after spray application in the exposure study and also following dosing at a level calculated from the mean measured levels in pollen and nectar, showing the applicability and robustness of the approach for dose setting with honeybee brood studies. This study has developed a versatile and predictive approach for use in higher tier honeybee toxicity studies. It can be used to realistically quantify exposure of colonies to pesticides to allow the appropriate dose rates to be determined, based on realistic worst-case residues in pollen and nectar and estimated intake by the colony, as shown by the residue analysis. Previous studies have used the standard methodology developed primarily to identify pesticides with insect-growth disrupting properties of pesticide formulations, which are less reliant on identifying realistic exposure scenarios. However, this adaptation of the method can be used to determine dose-response effects of colony level exposure to pesticides with a wide range of properties. This approach would limit the number of replicated tunnel or field-scale studies that need to be undertaken to assess effects on honeybee brood and may be of particular benefit where residues in pollen and nectar are crop-and/or formulation-specific, such as systemic seed treatments and granular applications.

We here report on the results of sampling campaigns in 2004, and 2010-2012 showing that both species have established and massively expanded their range. Bombus terrestris, in particular, has spread by some 200kmyear-1 and had reached the Atlantic coast in Argentina by the end of 2011. Both species, and especially B.terrestris, are infected by protozoan parasites that seem to spread along with the imported hosts and spillover to native species. Genetic analyses by polymorphic microsatellite loci suggest that the host population of B.terrestris is genetically diverse, as expected from a large invading founder population, and structured through isolation by distance. Genetically, the populations of the trypanosomatid parasite, Crithidia bombi, sampled in 2004 are less diverse, and distinct from the ones sampled later. Current C.bombi populations are highly heterozygous and also structured through isolation by distance correlating with the genetic distances of B.terrestris, suggesting the latter's expansion to be a main structuring factor for the parasite. Remarkably, wherever B.terrestris spreads, the native Bombus dahlbomii disappears although the reasons remain unclear.

Patterns of dispersal and gene flow are key determinants of species' ability to respond to land-use change, but have been little investigated at a fine scale (<10 km) in bumble bees. Using microsatellite markers, we determined the fine-scale spatial genetic structure of populations of four common Bombus species (B. terrestris, B. lapidarius, B. pascuorum and B. hortorum) and one declining species (B. ruderatus) in an agricultural landscape in Southern England, UK. The study landscape contained sown flower patches representing agri-environment options for pollinators. We found that, as expected, the B. ruderatus population was characterized by relatively low heterozygosity, number of alleles and colony density. Across all species, inbreeding was absent or present but weak (F-IS = 0.01-0.02). Using queen genotypes reconstructed from worker sibships and colony locations estimated from the positions of workers within these sibships, we found that significant isolation by distance was absent in B. lapidarius, B. hortorum and B. ruderatus. In B. terrestris and B. pascuorum, it was present but weak; for example, in these two species, expected relatedness of queens founding colonies 1 m apart was 0.02. These results show that bumble bee populations exhibit low levels of spatial genetic structure at fine spatial scales, most likely because of ongoing gene flow via widespread queen dispersal. In addition, the results demonstrate the potential for agri-environment scheme conservation measures to facilitate fine-scale gene flow by creating a more even distribution of suitable habitats across landscapes.",,,,"Redhead, John/E-6750-2012; Bourke, Andrew/E-5271-2011","Redhead, John/0000-0002-2233-3848; Sumner, Seirian/0000-0003-0213-2018",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,JUL,2014,23,14,,,,,3384,3395,,10.1111/mec.12823,,,,,,,WOS:000339389000002,24980963,,,,

The Main Agroecological Structure (MAS) is a new concept to identify and characterize the agroecosystems. The method uses local variables related with agricultural management, landscape and cultural variables. As a first approach to study the relationship between MAS and pollination, we characterized nine systems (five coffee farms, four forests) located in Cundinamarca, using ten local variables, the distance to the forest as a landscape variable and bees (visitors of coffee flowers). The field work was done during the flowerings of 2011 y 2012. After the capture, bees were identified and the pollen loads were analyzed. We found 130 bees of the subfamilies: Halictinae (three species), Megachilidae (one species) and Apinae (nine species). Trigona was the richest genera. The most common visitors of coffee flowers were Apis mellifera and Paratrigona eutaeniata. The bees richness was positive related with plants richness (P = 0.031, R-2 = 0.96) and the forest proximity (P = 0.0075, R-2 = 0.52), Also, we found a negatively trend with the increase in coffee density (P = 0.045, R-2 = 0.67). In the analysis of the pollen loads we identified trees, herbs and epiphytes species, this suggested that bees foraging in all vegetation strata. In this analysis we also found species related with the coffee system and others more related with forest and hedges.

Surprisingly, given the substantial price tag and mandatory EU member participation [2], there is either a lack of [1] or mixed [1, 2, 7] evidence-based support for the schemes. One novel source of data to evaluate AESs may be provided by an organism that itself may benefit from them. Honeybees (Apis mellifera), important pollinators for crops and wildflowers [8, 9], are declining in parts of the world from many factors, including loss of available forage from agricultural intensification [10-13]. We analyzed landscape-level honeybee foraging ecology patterns over two years by decoding 5,484 waggle dances from bees located in the center of a mixed, urban-rural 94 km(2) area, including lands under government-funded AESs. The waggle dance, a unique behavior performed by successful foragers, communicates to nestmates the most profitable foraging locations [14-16]. After correcting for distance, dances demonstrate that honeybees possess a significant preference for rural land managed under UK Higher Level AESs and a significant preference against rural land under UK Organic Entry Level AESs. Additionally, the two most visited areas contained a National and Local Nature Reserve, respectively. Our study demonstrates that honeybees, with their great foraging range and sensitive response to forage quality, can be used as bioindicators to monitor large areas and provide information relevant to better environmental management.",,,,"Schurch, Roger/J-8744-2019","Schurch, Roger/0000-0001-9075-8912",,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,1879-0445,,,,Jun-02,2014,24,11,,,,,1212,1215,,10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.072,,,,,,,WOS:000336668500020,24856213,,,,

We combined bioinformatics and measurements of transcript abundance to start characterizing AmOCLP1, a recently discovered Inhibitor Cysteine Knot peptide in the honey bee Apis mellifera. We found that the genomes of ants, bees, and the wasp Nasonia vitripennis encode orthologous sequences indicating that OCLP1 is a conserved peptide and not unique to the honey bee. Search of available EST libraries and quantitative real time PCR analyses indicate that the transcript of AmOCLP1 is ubiquitous with expression in life stages ranging from embryos to adults and in all tested tissues. In worker honey bees AmOCLP1 expression was not associated with age or task and did not show clear enrichment in any of the tested tissues. There was however a consistent trend toward higher transcript levels in the abdomen of foragers relative to levels in the head or thorax, and compared to levels in the abdomen of younger worker bees. By contrast, in drones AmOCLP1 transcript levels appeared higher in the head relative to the abdomen. Finer analyses of the head and abdomen indicated that the AmOCLP1 transcript is not enriched in the stinger and the associated venom sac or in cephalic exocrine glands. The evolutionary conservation in the Hymenoptera, the ubiquitous expression, and the lack of enrichment in the venom gland, stinger, exocrine glands, and the brain are not consistent with the hypotheses that OCLP1 is a secreted honeybee toxin or an endotoxin acting in the central nervous system.

Workers in several bee species travel to conspecific nests (drifting'), enter them, and produce male offspring inside them, so acting as intra-specific social parasites. This adds a new dimension to bees' reproductive behaviour and spatial ecology, but the extent to which drifting occurs over field scales, i.e. at natural nest densities in field conditions, has been unclear. 2. Using the bumble bee Bombus terrestris (Linnaeus) as a model system, we sought to determine rates of worker drifting at field scales and the frequency of potential drifter workers in wild nests. 3. A field experiment with 27 colonies showed that workers travelled to, and became accepted in, conspecific nests that were up to 60m away, although the number of accepted drifter workers within nests fell significantly with distance. The rate at which nests were entered by drifters was relatively high and significantly exceeded the rate at which drifters became accepted. 4. Microsatellite genotyping of eight field-collected nests from Greater London, U.K., showed that a low frequency (3%) of workers were not full sisters of nestmate workers and hence were likely to have been drifter workers. 5. It is therefore concluded that workers can drift to conspecific nests over field scales and confirmed that successful drifting occurs in natural populations.

At a landscape scale, bee communities are affected by habitat composition, anthropogenic land use, and fragmentation. However, little information is available on local-scale spatial distribution of bee communities within habitats that are uniform at the landscape scale. We studied a bee community along with floral and nesting resources over a 32 km(2) area of uninterrupted Mediterranean scrubland. Our objectives were (i) to analyze floral and nesting resource composition at the habitat scale. We ask whether these resources follow a geographical pattern across the scrubland at bee-foraging relevant distances; (ii) to analyze the distribution of bee composition across the scrubland. Bees being highly mobile organisms, we ask whether bee composition shows a homogeneous distribution or else varies spatially. If so, we ask whether this variation is irregular or follows a geographical pattern and whether bees respond primarily to flower or to nesting resources; and (iii) to establish whether body size influences the response to local resource availability and ultimately spatial distribution. We obtained 6580 specimens belonging to 98 species. Despite bee mobility and the absence of environmental barriers, our bee community shows a clear geographical pattern. This pattern is mostly attributable to heterogeneous distribution of small (<55 mg) species (with presumed smaller foraging ranges), and is mostly explained by flower resources rather than nesting substrates. Even then, a large proportion (54.8%) of spatial variability remains unexplained by flower or nesting resources. We conclude that bee communities are strongly conditioned by local effects and may exhibit spatial heterogeneity patterns at a scale as low as 500-1000 m in patches of homogeneous habitat.

These forests, which harbour the most important C. arabica gene pool, are threatened by increasing anthropogenic disturbance, potentially altering the mating patterns, pollen dispersal and maintenance of genetic diversity in C. arabica understorey populations. We genotyped 376 adult coffee shrubs and 418 progenies from three natural unmanaged, and three highly managed coffee populations, using 24 microsatellite markers. Mating system analysis of C. arabica yielded an overall multilocus outcrossing rate of 76%, which contrasts with the common knowledge that C. arabica is a predominantly selfing species. In highly managed coffee populations, paternity could be assigned to 78% of the progenies, whereas in the unmanaged natural coffee populations, only 57% of the progenies could be assigned to a father, indicating reduced long-distance pollen dispersal in managed forests. Furthermore, the fraction of selfed progenies was significantly higher in managed (23%) than unmanaged (10%) coffee forests. Finally, the lack of spatial genetic structure in all studied populations suggests high seed dispersal in unmanaged populations, and intense berry harvesting and coffee planting in the managed populations. Our results imply that in situ conservation of the wild gene pool of C. arabica must focus on limiting intensification of coffee forest management, as decreased pollen dispersal and increased selfing in C. arabica in intensively managed populations may increase the risk of genetic erosion.

Of particular interest is whether similar dimensions are compared to each other or whether each alternative is assigned an absolute value (utility). We assumed that choice proportions would follow Weber's effect, according to which discrimination is proportional to relative difference (difference/mean). We tested honey bees in a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) paradigm of proboscis-extension response (PER) conditioning. Subjects were conditioned over six trials to associate each of two odours with sucrose solution rewards and then tested in a choice trial between the two alternatives. Each group of subjects was tested in one treatment, and there were four treatments in each of six experiments. Rewards differed in delay, duration of feeding, and sucrose concentration. In each treatment, the high-profitability alternative was better than the low-profitability alternative along a single dimension, but between treatments of each experiment values in another dimension monotonically increased. Proboscis-response proportions during the conditioning phase tended to be greater for the high-profitability alternative, and choice proportions for it in the choice phase ranged between 0.72 and 0.89 in the 24 treatments. We show for the first time that harnessed bees are sensitive to reward delay. Preferences did not differ statistically between the different treatments of any of the experiments. The results support comparative evaluation of alternatives and are pertinent to multi-attribute choice, with implications for context-dependent preferences.

We predicted that, for the mangrove Avicennia marina in temperate southeast Australia, pollinator diversity would be low and its pollination system modified by the exotic honeybee Apis mellifera. Multiyear surveys and experiments were used to test these hypotheses by determining the identity and frequency of flower visitors, quantifying pollinator foraging behaviour, determining the species composition of pollen loads, and demonstrating pollen removal and deposition. We identified 38 species that visited flowers, but only A. mellifera was a significant pollinator. It was the only species to carry large amounts of pollen and forage in a manner permitting transfer of pollen to stigmas. Moreover, A. mellifera was the numerically dominant flower visitor and was effective in both pollen removal and deposition. This study demonstrates the importance of distinguishing flower visitors from pollinators and emphasises the surprisingly widespread influence of the exotic A. mellifera.

Regarding oilseed rape, the most common biofuel crop in the EU, positive responses of flower-visiting insects to plentiful nectar and pollen seem apparent. However, previous investigations on this insect guild revealed conflicting results, potentially because they focused on different taxonomic groups representing a narrow range of ecological traits and considered only short time periods. Here, using trap nests in landscapes with independent gradients in area of oilseed rape and seminatural habitats, we assessed the whole community of cavity-nesting bees and wasps, including early- and late-emerging species. Our study's temporal resolution allowed determination of flowering and postflowering effects of oilseed rape on these species' richness, abundance, and mortality. Species richness of cavity-nesting bees and wasps significantly increased with oilseed rape, although nesting activity was considerably higher after mass flowering. In addition to increasing richness independently of oilseed rape, the amount of seminatural habitat in the landscape was the sole positive driver of insect abundance once the community's dominant species was accounted for as a covariate. Thus, growth of the co-occurring species' community is not stimulated by the resource pulse provided by oilseed rape early in the year, but by persistent resources provided by seminatural habitats after mass flowering. Early individuals of bivoltine species' first generations accumulated in seminatural habitats when these habitats were scarce, but became increasingly diluted when habitat availability increased. Once established, later foraging females generally benefited from the resource availability of seminatural habitats when initializing the second generation. We conclude that mass-flowering crops, despite covering only a short interval of the community's main activity phase, benefit bee and wasp species richness. However, seminatural habitats are crucial in maintaining viable communities of flower-visiting insects at the landscape scale, mitigating potential negative effects of high land-use intensities in modern agro-ecosystems.",,,,"Jauker, Birgit/A-6281-2009; Jauker, Birgit/G-9740-2014; Diekotter, Tim/L-2463-2016; Wolters, Volkmar/B-4635-2010; Jauker, Frank/I-5823-2017","Jauker, Birgit/0000-0001-5027-9351; Jauker, Birgit/0000-0001-5027-9351; Jauker, Frank/0000-0003-4137-9072",,,,,,,,,,,,1757-1693,1757-1707,,,,MAY,2014,6,3,,,SI,,219,226,,10.1111/gcbb.12080,,,,,,,WOS:000334369300007,,,,,

Here we characterise the sensitivity, feeding response curve and food intake efficiency of the aphid tending ant, Lasius niger for major sugars found in nectar, honeydew and insect haemolymph (i.e. fructose, glucose, sucrose, melezitose and trehalose). We found that sucrose concentrations - ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 M - triggered food acceptance by L niger workers with their food intake efficiency being enhanced by sugar concentrations of 1 M or higher at which points energy intake was maximised. The range of sucrose concentrations that elicit a feeding response by L niger scouts thus overlaps with that of natural sugar resources. The response curves of feeding acceptance by scouts consistently increased with sugar concentration, except for trehalose which was disregarded by the ants. Ants are highly sensitive to sucrose and melezitose exhibiting low response thresholds. Sucrose, fructose and glucose share a same potential to act as phagostimulants as they had similar half feeding efficiency concentration values when expressed as the energetic content of sugar solution. Aphid-biosynthezised melezitose generated the highest sensitivity and phagostimulant potential. The feeding behavior of ants appears to be primarily regulated by the energy content of the food solution for the main sugars present in nectar and honeydew. However, feeding by scouts is also influenced by the informative value of individual sugars when it serves as a cue for the presence of aphid partners such as the aphid-biosynthesised melezitose.

We investigated the responses of bees to pollen and nectar rewards, and the effects of these rewards on pollen deposition and fecundity in the hermaphroditic succulent shrub Aloe tenuior. Self-pollinated plants failed to set fruit, but their ovules were regularly penetrated by self-pollen tubes, which uniformly failed to develop into seeds as expected from ovarian self-incompatibility (or strong early inbreeding depression). Bees consistently foraged for pollen during the morning and early afternoon, but switched to nectar in the late afternoon. As a consequence of this differential foraging, we were able to test the relative contribution to fecundity of pollen-versus nectar-collecting flower visitors. We exposed emasculated and intact flowers in either the morning or late afternoon to foraging bees and showed that emasculation reduced pollen deposition by insects in the morning, but had little effect in the afternoon. Despite the potential for self-pollination to result in ovule discounting due to late-acting self-sterility, fecundity was severely reduced in artificially emasculated plants. Although there were temporal fluctuations in reward preference, most bee visits were for pollen rewards. Therefore the benefit of providing pollen that is accessible to bee foragers outweighs any potential costs to fitness in terms of gender interference in this species.",,,,"Johnson, Steven D/F-1146-2010; Peter, Craig/B-6564-2008; Johnson, Steven/P-2104-2019","Johnson, Steven D/0000-0002-5114-5862; Peter, Craig/0000-0002-9741-6533; Johnson, Steven/0000-0002-5114-5862",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Apr-22,2014,9,4,,,,,,,e94908,10.1371/journal.pone.0094908,,,,,,,WOS:000335240300021,24755611,,,,

As bees will not forage at long distances unnecessarily, this suggests summer is the most challenging season, with bees utilizing an area 22 and 6 times greater than spring or autumn.

In this study, Vosnesensky bumble bees (Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski) were collected from a range of human-altered and natural landscapes in northern California. Extensive vegetation surveys and Geographic Information System (GIS)-based habitat classifications were conducted at each site, bees were genotyped to identify colony mates, and pollen loads were examined to identify visited plants. In contrast to predictions based on strong competitive interactions, pollen load composition was significantly more similar for bees captured in a shared study region compared with bees throughout the research area but was not significantly more similar for colony mates. Preference analyses revealed that pollen loads were not composed of the most abundant plant species per study region. The majority of ranked pollen preference lists were significantly correlated for pairwise comparisons of colony mates and individuals within a study region, whereas the majority of pairwise comparisons of ranked pollen preference lists between individuals located at separate study regions were uncorrelated. Results suggest that pollen load composition and foraging preferences are similar for bees throughout a shared landscape regardless of colony membership.

Current agricultural landscapes are poor in flowers resources for bumble bees. Available forage crops are predominantly early-season mass-flowering crops (MFC). It has been suggested, but not tested, that scarcity of late-season flower resources are limiting bumble bee populations. We examined whether addition of late-season flowering red clover affected worker, queen and male bumble bee densities. Bumble bees were surveyed in flower-rich uncultivated field borders across 24 landscapes (radius 2 km) with or without a clover field in the centre, varying in semi-natural grassland (SNG) and early MFC availability. Clover fields had over ten times higher worker densities compared to field borders, suggesting red clover as favoured forage. Five times more queens and 71% more males were found in landscapes with clover fields compared to control landscapes, despite these fields constituting less than 0.2% of the landscape area. Both MFC and SNG increased the density of males, but only in the presence of clover fields.

In this study, we investigate the impact of Pleistocene climate change on three Neotropical orchid bee species (Eulaema bombiformis, E.meriana and E.cingulata) with transcontinental distributions and different physiological tolerances. We first generated ecological niche models to identify species-specific climatically stable areas during Pleistocene climatic oscillations. Using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear markers, we inferred calibrated phylogenies and estimated historical demographic parameters to reconstruct the phylogeographical history of each species. Our results indicate species with narrower physiological tolerance experienced less suitable habitat during glaciations and currently exhibit strong population structure in the mitochondrial genome. However, nuclear markers with low and high mutation rates show lack of association with geography. These results combined with lower migration rate estimates from the mitochondrial than the nuclear genome suggest male-biased dispersal.

Flower use by bumblebees in English urban gardens,ANNALS OF BOTANY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although urban gardens provide opportunities for pollinators in an otherwise inhospitable environment, most garden plants are not native to the recipient biogeographical region and their value to local pollinators is disputed. This study tested the hypothesis that bumblebees foraging in English urban gardens preferentially visited sympatric Palaearctic-range plants over species originating outside their native range. Twenty-seven surveys of flower availability and bumblebee visitation (Bombus spp.) were conducted over a 3-month summer period. Plants were categorized according to whether they were native British, Palaearctic or non-Palaearctic in origin. A phylogeny of the 119 plant species recorded was constructed and the relationship between floral abundance and the frequency of pollinator visits investigated by means of phylogenetically independent contrasts. Differentiation in utilization of plant species by the five bumblebee species encountered was investigated using niche overlap analyses. There was conflicting evidence for preferential use of native-range Palaearctic plant species by bumblebees depending on which plants were included in the analysis. Evidence was also found for niche partitioning between species based on respective preferences for native and non-native biogeographical range plants. Two bumblebees (Bombus terrestris and B. pratorum) concentrated their foraging activity on non-Palaearctic plants, while two others (B. hortorum and B. pascourum) preferred Palaearctic species. The long-running debate about the value of native and non-native garden plants to pollinators probably stems from a failure to properly consider biogeographical overlap between plant and pollinator ranges. Gardeners can encourage pollinators without consideration of plant origin or bias towards local biogeographical species. However, dietary specialist bumblebees seem to prefer plants sympatric with their own biogeographical range and, in addition to the cultivation of these species in gardens, provision of native non-horticultural (weed) species may also be important for pollinator conservation.",,,,"Franco, Miguel/A-4671-2008","Franco, Miguel/0000-0002-7249-4981",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,1095-8290,,,,APR,2014,113,5,,,,,799,806,,10.1093/aob/mcu006,,,,,,,WOS:000333249000005,24647914,,,,

We studied a host-antagonist system of cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their antagonists and hypothesised that hosts and antagonists show different responses to local land-use intensity, the diversity of landscape in terms of composition and the spatial structure of landscape in terms of configuration. In a highly replicated study, we established nesting resources on 95 grasslands in three geographic regions across Germany and measured species richness and abundance of hosts (bees and wasps) and their antagonists, and rates of parasitism. For each site, we quantified local land-use intensity as well as landscape heterogeneity in terms of composition and configuration at spatial scales ranging from 250 m to 2000 m. Increasing landscape heterogeneity enhanced species richness, abundance and parasitism rate, whereas local land-use intensity only marginally negatively affected total abundance. Bee and wasp abundance as well as wasp species richness were enhanced by landscape composition at 250 m, whereas their antagonists were enhanced by landscape configuration at 1500 m. In conclusion, landscape composition and configuration affect trophic levels differently and are more relevant than local land-use intensity. Solitary bees and wasps, which offer important pollination and pest control services, could be supported by enhancing landscape diversity, while their antagonists could benefit from measures that promote landscape connectivity.

However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting arthropod communities, and the extent to which they facilitate connectivity of these communities within the urban environment is currently largely unknown. We investigated the variation of species community composition (beta diversity) of four arthropod groups with contrasting mobility (Carabidae, Araneae, Curculionidae, and Apidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 extensively managed green sites on the ground in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. With redundancy analysis and variation partitioning, we (1) disentangled the relative importance of local environmental conditions, the surrounding land cover composition, and habitat connectivity on species community composition, (2) searched for specific spatial scales of habitat connectivity for the different arthropod groups, and (3) discussed the ecological and functional value of green roofs in cities. Our study revealed that on green roofs community composition of high-mobility arthropod groups (bees and weevils) were mainly shaped by habitat connectivity, while low-mobility arthropod groups (carabids and spiders) were more influenced by local environmental conditions. A similar but less pronounced pattern was found for ground communities. The high importance of habitat connectivity in shaping high-mobility species community composition indicates that these green roof communities are substantially connected by the frequent exchange of individuals among surrounding green roofs. On the other hand, low-mobility species communities on green roofs are more likely connected to ground sites than to other green roofs. The integration of green roofs in urban spatial planning strategies has great potential to enable higher connectivity among green spaces, so that eventually even communities of low-mobility species become connected. Furthermore, improving the design of green roofs (composition and configuration of vegetation and soil types) could enhance the ecological value, particularly for low-mobility species.",,,,"Ghazoul, Jaboury/B-2121-2018",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,APR,2014,95,4,,,,,1010,1021,,10.1890/13-0705.1,,,,,,,WOS:000334573600019,24933819,,,,

Since 2006, when unexpectedly high colony losses were first reported, articles have proliferated in the popular press suggesting a range of possible causes and raising alarm over the general decline of bees. Suggested causes include pesticides, genetically modified crops, habitat fragmentation, and introduced diseases and parasites. Scientists have concluded that multiple factors in various combinations-including mites, fungi, viruses, and pesticides, as well as other factors such as reduction in forage, poor nutrition, and queen failure-are the most probable cause of elevated colony loss rates. Investigators and regulators continue to focus on the possible role that insecticides, particularly the neonicotinoids, may play in honeybee health. Neonicotinoid insecticides are insect neurotoxicants with desirable features such as broad-spectrum activity, low application rates, low mammalian toxicity, upward systemic movement in plants, and versatile application methods. Their distribution throughout the plant, including pollen, nectar, and guttation fluids, poses particular concern for exposure to pollinators. The authors describe how neonicotinoids interact with the nervous system of honeybees and affect individual honeybees in laboratory situations. Because honeybees are social insects, colony effects in semifield and field studies are discussed. The authors conclude with a review of current and proposed guidance in the United States and Europe for assessing the risks of pesticides to honeybees. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:719-731.

Native insect pollinators depend on natural or semi-natural land surrounding farms for nesting and alternative foraging resources. Despite interest in conserving pollinators through habitat restoration, the scale at which land use affects pollinators and thus crop pollination services is not well understood. We measured abundance of native, wild bee pollinators and the pollination services they provided to highbush blueberry Vaccinium corymbosum L. crops at 16 sites that varied in the proportion of surrounding agricultural land cover at both the field scale (300-m radius) and the landscape scale (1500-m radius). We designed our study such that agricultural land cover at the field scale was uncorrelated with agricultural cover at the landscape scale across sites. We used model selection to determine which spatial scale better predicted aggregate bee abundance, abundance of large versus small bees and crop pollination services. We found that, overall, bees responded more strongly to field-scale than to landscape-scale land cover, but the scale at which land cover had the strongest effect varied by bee body size. Large bees showed a negative response to increasing agricultural cover at both scales, but were most strongly affected by the landscape scale. Small bees were negatively affected by agricultural land cover but only at the field scale, while they had a small positive response to agricultural cover at the landscape scale. Aggregate pollination services from native bees were more strongly influenced by field-scale agricultural cover, due to the combined effects of both large and small bees responding at that scale.Synthesis and applications. Bee abundance and pollination services were strongly determined by field-scale agricultural cover, suggesting that field-scale set-asides may provide significant benefits to pollination services. Further, we found that pollinators respond differently to land use depending on body size, but all groups of bees benefit from decreasing agricultural cover at the field scale. Therefore, small-scale modifications to habitat can have significant impacts on both pollinator abundance and pollination services to crop plants.

We also used a historical dataset to compare historical and recent habitat suitability predictions for forecasting variations in species' responses to regional climate warming. LocationThe Cantabrian Range (Iberian Peninsula, south-western Europe). MethodsDuring 2007-09 we sampled bumblebees in 37 localities and developed generalized linear models (GLMs) to predict species' occurrence and abundance in relation to environmental variables. We extracted independent variables at different spatial scales for each locality, based on topoclimatic (slope, temperature and rainfall patterns) and land-cover (habitat configuration and composition) variables. We also used historical (1988-89) bumblebee data (23 localities) to both calibrate recent distribution models and determine the current environmental factors underlying the realized response of individual species to regional climate warming (0.8 degrees C) over two decades. ResultsOccurrence and abundance patterns of species were best predicted by models combining topoclimatic and land-cover variables. Our findings revealed three groups of species, distinguished on the basis of the realized response of individual species to regional climate warming: one comprising six species with climate-based tracking behaviour, a second with three species tracking suitable landscape composition and configuration regardless of climatic conditions, and a third comprising one species showing no apparent tracking behaviour. Main conclusionsTopoclimate and land cover determined the occurrence and abundance patterns of bumblebee species in mountainous landscapes, even at fine spatial extents. Both environmental variables, however, differentially influenced bumblebees, thereby providing relevant clues for determining the current environmental factors underlying species' distributions and their susceptibility to changing environmental conditions. Our findings therefore suggest that determining habitat suitability can be used as a baseline approach for understanding species-specific responses to climate warming and for developing vulnerability assessments for conservation-focused management planning.",,,,"Herrera, Jose M./L-7432-2013; Javier Rodriguez-Perez, Ph.D. Biology/C-9773-2009","Herrera, Jose M./0000-0001-7968-3438; Javier Rodriguez-Perez, Ph.D. Biology/0000-0002-1292-9090",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,APR,2014,41,4,,,,,700,712,,10.1111/jbi.12236,,,,,,,WOS:000332781100006,,,,,

These factors have been at the core of proposed explanations for the reproductive failure and numerical decline of Acacia carneorum and other threatened acacias. Paradoxically, the sympatric Acacia ligulata is thriving and highly fecund. Although these species have superficially similar floral displays, differences in sexual reproductive success may reflect interactions between flower and inflorescence ontogeny and pollinator assemblages. We compared the floral biology and flower visitor assemblages of A. carneorum and A. ligulata at four sites per species. Both species displayed similar floral ontogeny and synchronicity of display, with inflorescences simultaneously hermaphroditic for 4-5 days. However, A. ligulata displayed a higher density of flowers than A. carneorum and, while both species received a range of flower visitors, A. ligulata was visited by relatively few species and was serviced primarily by the non-native honeybee Apis mellifera, which typically made many within-plant movements during foraging bouts. In contrast, A. carneorum was visited by a diverse suite of native insects that carried little pollen and made fewer within plant movements. On average, Apis mellifera carried 98.4 % A. ligulata pollen, whereas the native insect visitors of A. carneorum carried only 45 % A. carneorum pollen. Differing floral ontogeny or lack of native pollinators does not explain the reproductive failure of A. carneorum. The success of A. ligulata may reflect pollination services provided by A. mellifera and interactions with plant mating systems.",,,,"Ayre, David J/A-8761-2008; Denham, Andrew/E-3545-2012","Ayre, David J/0000-0002-3124-4417; Denham, Andrew/0000-0002-8375-2747",,,,,,,,,,,,0912-3814,1440-1703,,,,MAR,2014,29,2,,,,,225,235,,10.1007/s11284-013-1117-y,,,,,,,WOS:000333157400012,,,,,

In this research, we examine the separate and combined effects of wing area and wing area asymmetry on maximum load-lifting capability in bumble bees Bombus impatiens Cresson, 1863. Individual bees with experimentally induced forewing wear (0%-24% forewing area loss, 0%-38% forewing area asymmetry) were harnessed with a string to which small bead groups were attached and tested in a flight chamber to measure the maximum weight that they could lift incrementally. Wing wear significantly decreased load-lifting ability: the higher the mean wing area loss, the less mass a bee could lift (2.66 mg load reduction per 1% forewing area loss, which represents similar to 1.6% of mean body mass or similar to 5.2% of expected mean nectar load). However, wing area asymmetry, both alone and in combination with area loss, had no detectable effect on maximum lift. The clear cost of wing wear for bumble bees is a linear reduction in weight-lifting capability through loss of wing area. This relatively strong diminution of load lifting by wing wear, observed over the range of wing area losses naturally accrued by wild bees, provides a potential mechanism for declining foraging ability and survivorship of worker bees with wing wear. What remains to be explained is the utter insensitivity of maximum load lifted to forewing asymmetry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0008-4301,1480-3283,,,,MAR,2014,92,3,,,,,179,184,,10.1139/cjz-2013-0229,,,,,,,WOS:000331621300001,,,,,

For organisms living in fragmented habitats, population persistence may depend on dispersal, which maintains gene flow among fragments and can prevent inbreeding within them. It is centrally important to understand patterns of dispersal for bees living in fragmented areas given the importance of pollination systems and recently documented declines in bee populations. We used population and landscape genetic techniques to characterize patterns of dispersal over a large fragmented area in southern Costa Rica for the orchid bee species Euglossa championi. First, we estimated levels of genetic differentiation among forest fragments as (PT), an analog to the traditional summary statistic F-ST, as well as two statistics that may more adequately represent levels of differentiation, G'(ST) and D-est. Second, we used a Bayesian approach to determine the number and composition of genetic groups in our sample. Third we investigated how genetic differentiation changes with distance. Fourth, we determined the extent to which deforested areas restrict dispersal. Finally, we estimated the extent to which there were temporal differences in allele frequencies within the same forest fragments. Within years we found low levels of differentiation even over 80km, and no effect of land use type on level of genetic differentiation.

The technique described gives a simple method for exploring the effects of the removal of wild corridors, and the creation of wild set-aside fields: interventions that are common to many national agricultural policies. The effects of these manipulations on central-place nesting pollinators are varied, and depend upon the behavioural rules that the pollinators are using to move through the environment.

Such social learning might be explained by relatively simple associative learning mechanism: the bee may learn to associate conspecifics with nectar or pollen reward through previous experience of foraging jointly. However, in some studies, observers were guided by choices of 'demonstrators' viewed through a screen, so no reward was given to the observers at the time of seeing other bees' flowers choice and no demonstrator bee was present at the moment of decision. This behaviour, referred to observational conditioning, implies an additional associative step as the positive value of conspecific is transferred to the associated flower. Here we explore the role of demonstrator movement, and the distance between observers and demonstrators that is required for observation conditioning to take place. Methodology/Principal Findings: We identify the conditions under which observational conditioning occurs in the widespread European species Bombus terrestris. The presence of artificial demonstrator bees leads to a significant change in individual colour preference toward the indicated colour if demonstrators were moving and observation distance was limited (15 cm), suggesting that observational conditioning could only influence relatively short-range foraging decisions. In addition, the movement of demonstrators is a crucial factor for observational conditioning, either due to the more life-like appearance of moving artificial bees or an enhanced detectability of moving demonstrators, and an increased efficiency at directing attention to the indicated flower colour. Conclusion: Bumblebees possess the capacity to learn the quality of a flower by distal observation of other foragers' choices. This confirms that social learning in bees involves more advanced processes than simple associative learning, and indicates that observational conditioning might be widespread in pollinating insects, raising intriguing questions for the underlying mechanisms as well as the spread of social information in pollinator-plant interactions.",,,,"Chittka, Lars/C-3110-2012; Avargues-Weber, Aurore/V-5795-2019","Chittka, Lars/0000-0001-8153-1732; Avargues-Weber, Aurore/0000-0003-3160-6710",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Feb-07,2014,9,2,,,,,,,e88415,10.1371/journal.pone.0088415,,,,,,,WOS:000330834400067,24516654,,,,

We searched for congruent characteristics in the floristic/faunistic structure of plant and bee species, and for differences between two study years. We also asked which vegetation type or complex plays the most important role as a pollen or nectar resource for wild bees, and what conclusions can be drawn for nature conservation. The vegetation types or complexes range from basiphytic pioneer stages to consolidated basiphytic to slightly acidophytic grasslands (classes Koelerio-Corynephoretea and Festuco-Brometea): Koelerion glaucae complex (1), Armerio-Festucetum trachyphyllae (2a, typical; 2b, ruderalized), ruderalized ex-arable field (3), and Allio-Stipetum capillatae (4). We used a plot-based approach for recording vegetation data and flower-visiting wild bees. Releves were sampled and flower-visiting bees netted on defined flower resources (2004, 2005). Data were analyzed by ordination, mixed linear models and regression analysis. Phytosociological table and DCA show clear floristic differentiations between the vegetation types and complexes. For the bee data there were weaker species-based differentiations. In the year 2004 there were two bee assemblages, in the year 2005 this differentiation was not detectable.

These types were characterized by a high diversity of entomophilous plant species in combination with high flower density. Although ruderalized sandy grasslands have only moderate conservation value based on vegetation characteristics, they offer remarkable resources for species-rich populations of wild bees. Important flower resources for endangered wild-bee species are, among others, Centaurea stoebe s.l., Berteroa incana and Carduus nutans.

Using data on bees collected from 19 oak-savannah fragments, the question of whether bee communities differ when fragments are embedded in different landscapes (Douglas-fir forest vs. urban residential neighbourhoods) was investigated, and also whether these differences could be attributed to species-specific traits of bees (e.g. body size, specialization) and/or within-fragment floral resources. No differences were found in overall richness or abundance of bees, but there were distinct differences in plant and bee community composition between matrix types. Common wood-nesters and late-flying, small-bodied bees tended to be found in urban-associated fragments, which also had a lower availability of within-fragment floral resources. Forest-associated fragments, on the other hand, had a greater density and richness of early-flowering native plant species, and supported a higher abundance of large-bodied bee species. Bumble bee abundance, in particular, increased with increasing proportion of forest cover in the surrounding landscape. Large-bodied bees appear to respond to increased availability of within-fragment floral resources, but it was also hypothesised that nesting and floral resources in matrix habitat drive the differences in bee community assemblages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,1365-2311,,,,FEB,2014,39,1,,,,,83,93,,10.1111/een.12070,,,,,,,WOS:000330621000010,,,,,

The Sahara is the largest warm desert in the world and together with the arid Sahel displays high topographical and climatic heterogeneity, and has experienced recent and strong climatic oscillations that have greatly shifted biodiversity distribution and community composition. The large size, remoteness and long-term political instability of the Sahara-Sahel, have limited knowledge on its biodiversity. However, over the last decade, there have been an increasing number of published scientific studies based on modern geomatic and molecular tools, and broad sampling of taxa of these regions. This review tracks trends in knowledge about biodiversity patterns, processes and threats across the Sahara-Sahel, and anticipates needs for biodiversity research and conservation. Recent studies are changing completely the perception of regional biodiversity patterns. Instead of relatively low species diversity with distribution covering most of the region, studies now suggest a high rate of endemism and larger number of species, with much narrower and fragmented ranges, frequently limited to micro-hotspots of biodiversity. Molecular-based studies are also unravelling cryptic diversity associated with mountains, which together with recent distribution atlases, allows identifying integrative biogeographic patterns in biodiversity distribution. Mapping of multivariate environmental variation (at 1kmx1km resolution) of the region illustrates main biogeographical features of the Sahara-Sahel and supports recently hypothesised dispersal corridors and refugia. Micro-scale water-features present mostly in mountains have been associated with local biodiversity hotspots. However, the distribution of available data on vertebrates highlights current knowledge gaps that still apply to a large proportion of the Sahara-Sahel. Current research is providing insights into key evolutionary and ecological processes, including causes and timing of radiation and divergence for multiple taxa, and associating the onset of the Sahara with diversification processes for low-mobility vertebrates. Examples of phylogeographic patterns are showing the importance of allopatric speciation in the Sahara-Sahel, and this review presents a synthetic overview of the most commonly hypothesised diversification mechanisms. Studies are also stressing that biodiversity is threatened by increasing human activities in the region, including overhunting and natural resources prospection, and in the future by predicted global warming. A representation of areas of conflict, landmines, and natural resources extraction illustrates how human activities and regional insecurity are hampering biodiversity research and conservation. Although there are still numerous knowledge gaps for the optimised conservation of biodiversity in the region, a set of research priorities is provided to identify the framework data needed to support regional conservation planning.",,,,"Silva, Teresa Luisa/L-7902-2013; Anton, Guillermo Velo/I-7694-2013; Sillero, Neftali/C-1803-2008; Martinez-Freiria, Fernando/L-7075-2013; Vale, Candida Gomes/AAD-9655-2019; Rosa, Joaquin/L-8436-2014; Santos, Xavier/L-7748-2013; Leite, Joao Vasco/M-4930-2019; Vale, Candida/L-7243-2013; Rebelo, Hugo/C-9005-2009; Ferreira, Sonia Alexandra Fernandes/L-7141-2013; Godinho, Raquel/L-6804-2013; Boratynski, Zbyszek/AAF-2389-2020; Tarroso, Pedro/I-3023-2012; Carvalho, Silvia/AAE-9566-2020; Campos, Joao/L-7901-2013; Alvares, Francisco/K-6353-2013; Santos, Xavier/O-4397-2019; Goncalves, Duarte V./H-7868-2012; Brito, Jose C./A-7831-2010; Fahd, Soumia/L-6196-2013; Carranza, Salvador/A-2126-2012","Silva, Teresa Luisa/0000-0002-6868-7035; Anton, Guillermo Velo/0000-0002-9483-5695; Sillero, Neftali/0000-0002-3490-3780; Martinez-Freiria, Fernando/0000-0003-2311-8960; Rosa, Joaquin/0000-0002-9035-8123; Santos, Xavier/0000-0002-4330-4261; Leite, Joao Vasco/0000-0001-9159-4016; Vale, Candida/0000-0003-1764-8607; Rebelo, Hugo/0000-0002-7118-4068; Ferreira, Sonia Alexandra Fernandes/0000-0002-6884-3966; Godinho, Raquel/0000-0002-4260-4799; Boratynski, Zbyszek/0000-0003-4668-4922; Tarroso, Pedro/0000-0002-2694-1170; Carvalho, Silvia/0000-0003-4368-4708; Campos, Joao/0000-0002-9144-4680; Alvares, Francisco/0000-0002-4033-6989; Santos, Xavier/0000-0002-4330-4261; Goncalves, Duarte V./0000-0003-4299-0375; Brito, Jose C./0000-0001-5444-8132; Fahd, Soumia/0000-0002-4464-4145; Carranza, Salvador/0000-0002-5378-3008",,,,,,,,,,,,1464-7931,1469-185X,,,,FEB,2014,89,1,,,,,215,231,,10.1111/brv.12049,,,,,,,WOS:000329357500012,23848599,,,,

Understanding national patterns in the spatial structure of natural pest control and pollination can be used to promote effective crop management and contribute to long-term food security. We mapped the species richness and functional diversity of ground beetles and bees to provide surrogate measures of natural pest control and pollination for Great Britain. Functional diversity represents the value and range of morphological and behavioural traits that support ecosystem services. We modelled the rate at which functional diversity collapsed in response to species extinctions to provide an index of functional redundancy. Deficits in functional diversity for both pest control and pollination were found in areas of high arable crop production. Ground beetle functional redundancy was positively correlated with the landscape cover of semi-natural habitats where extinctions were ordered by body size and dispersal ability. For bees, functional redundancy showed a weak positive correlation with semi-natural habitat cover where species extinctions were ordered by feeding specialization.Synthesis and applications. Increasingly, evidence suggests that functionally diverse assemblages of ground beetles and bees may be a key element to strategies that aim to support pollination and natural pest control in crops.

While oligolectic species forage on pollen from a single family of host plants, polylectic bees, such as bumblebees, collect pollen from many families of plants. These polylectic species contend with interspecific variability in essential nutrients of their host-plants but we have only a limited understanding of the way in which chemicals and chemical combinations influence bee development and feeding behaviour. In this paper, we investigated five different pollen diets (Calluna vulgaris, Cistus sp., Cytisus scoparius, Salix caprea and Sorbus aucuparia) to determine how their chemical content affected bumblebee colony development and pollen/syrup collection. Three compounds were used to characterise pollen content: polypeptides, amino acids and sterols. Several parameters were used to determine the impact of diet on micro-colonies: (i) Number and weight of larvae (total and mean weight of larvae), (ii) weight of pollen collected, (iii) pollen efficacy (total weight of larvae divided by weight of the pollen collected) and (iv) syrup collection. Our results show that pollen collection is similar regardless of chemical variation in pollen diet while syrup collection is variable. Microcolonies fed on S. aucuparia and C. scoparius pollen produced larger larvae (i. e. better mates and winter survivors) and fed less on nectar compared to the other diets. Pollen from both of these species contains 24-methylenecholesterol and high concentrations of polypeptides/total amino acids. This pollen nutritional ""theme"" seems therefore to promote worker reproduction in B. terrestris micro-colonies and could be linked to high fitness for queenright colonies. As workers are able to selectively forage on pollen of high chemical quality, plants may be evolutionarily selected for their pollen content, which might attract and increase the degree of fidelity of generalist pollinators, such as bumblebees.",,,,"Vanderplanck, Maryse/K-1072-2019; Michez, Denis/L-1370-2019","Vanderplanck, Maryse/0000-0002-0110-8019; Michez, Denis/0000-0001-8880-1838",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Jan-21,2014,9,1,,,,,,,e86209,10.1371/journal.pone.0086209,,,,,,,WOS:000330244500205,24465963,,,,

Flight is necessary for dispersal in many insects, and differences in dispersal capacity may reflect dissimilarities in flight muscle aerobic capacity. In a large metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary butterfly in the A land Islands in Finland, adults disperse frequently between small local populations. Individuals found in newly established populations have higher flight metabolic rates and field-measured dispersal distances than butterflies in old populations. To assess possible differences in flight muscle aerobic capacity among Glanville fritillary populations, enzyme activities and tissue concentrations of the mitochondrial protein Cytochrome-c Oxidase (CytOx) were measured and compared with four other species of Nymphalid butterflies. Flight muscle structure and mitochondrial density were also examined in the Glanville fritillary and a long-distance migrant, the red admiral. Glanville fritillaries from new populations had significantly higher aerobic capacities than individuals from old populations. Comparing the different species, strong-flying butterfly species had higher flight muscle CytOx content and enzymatic activity than short-distance fliers, and mitochondria were larger and more numerous in the flight muscle of the red admiral than the Glanville fritillary. These results suggest that superior dispersal capacity of butterflies in new populations of the Glanville fritillary is due in part to greater aerobic capacity, though this species has a low aerobic capacity in general when compared with known strong fliers. Low aerobic capacity may limit dispersal ability of the Glanville fritillary.",,,,"Wolfram, Joy/I-1574-2019; Jokitalo, Eija S/C-8375-2009; Dahlhoff, Elizabeth/AAI-1636-2020","Wolfram, Joy/0000-0003-0579-9897; Jokitalo, Eija S/0000-0002-4159-6934; Dahlhoff, Elizabeth/0000-0002-7019-5005",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Jan-08,2014,9,1,,,,,,,e78069,10.1371/journal.pone.0078069,,,,,,,WOS:000329862500003,24416122,,,,

The study was conducted in order to determine the best pollinator groups for coffee in Uganda and to collect relevant field information and determine the pollination efficiency of different bee species. Results indicate that across blooming seasons, coffee flowers were visited by 24-36 bee species. Hypotrigona gribodoi was the most frequent flower visitor, comprising over 60% of 5941 bee-visits recorded. Foraging rate and pollination speed varied among bee species. Solitary bees foraged on more flowers than social bees, but they spent less time per flower visited. Solitary bees visited more coffee trees and fields, but deposited less pollen, whereas social bees visited less trees and coffee fields in the landscape, but deposited more pollen on flowers. Fruit set was of 87%, 64% and 0.9%, respectively, in hand-cross pollination, open pollination and controlled-pollination treatments. Fruit abortion due to self-pollination was insignificant in this study. There was variability in pollination efficiency of different bee species. Pollination efficiency varied more significantly with sociality than with other bee functional traits and was not significantly influenced by tongue length and bee body size. Single-flower visits by social and solitary bees resulted in 89.7% and 68.14% fruit set, respectively. The most efficient bee species was Meliponula ferruginea (98.3%) followed by Meliponula nebulata (97.1%). Thus, very good pollinator species were wild social bees (mainly stingless bees) as opposed to honeybees and solitary bees that were previously reported to be the best pollinators of coffee in Panama and Indonesia. Morphological and anatomical characteristics of the bee pollen storage features may explain the difference in foraging behaviour activities and in pollination efficiency of social and solitary afrotropical bee species visiting lowland coffee in Uganda. In addition, pollination efficiency was influenced by land-use intensity, field management systems and habitat types found in the immediate surroundings of coffee fields, but not by coffee field size, coffee genotypes and mass blooming wild vegetation. It is recommended to farmers to adopt pollinator-friendly conservation and farming practices such as keeping an uncultivated portion (25%-30%) of their farms as pollinator reservoirs, protecting semi-natural habitats found in the vicinity of coffee fields, as well as promoting high on-farm tree cover to benefit a functionally diverse pollinator community.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0017-3134,1651-2049,,,,Jan-02,2014,53,1,,,,,69,89,,10.1080/00173134.2013.853831,,,,,,,WOS:000333874300005,,,,,

In the UK, approximately 15,000 Bombus terrestris nests per year are imported for use in this way. Here we examine pollen loads on commercial bumble bees returning to their nests, stationed next to soft fruit crops at three farms in Scotland, UK, to determine whether pollen-collecting bees are visiting the target crop. Only 12% of pollen was of Rubus type (most likely raspberry) and 15% was of Potentilla type (probably strawberry). The remaining 73% of pollen was from a range of non-target wildflowers, in declining importance: Brassicaceae (22%), Filipendula type (18%), Violaceae (11%), Trifolium type (6%) and Apiaceae (6%). It is unclear how this relates to the pollination service provided, since the bees may make nectar-collecting visits to the fruit crops.

Much of this deviation can be explained through differences in the characteristics of the flower patch, but not all. We suggest that the position of the flower patch within the landscape can have strong effects on bee patch use, independent of the characteristics of the flower patch, through changes in access to nesting resources and the microclimate. Further, the effects of different habitat configurations are likely to vary among bee groups, depending on flight distances and resource requirements. We surveyed local habitat and plant community characteristics around 100 observation plots in native grassland within temperate savannah and recorded bee patch use by direct observation. Using structural equation modeling, we quantified the direct and indirect effect of plant community and habitat configuration on patch use for all bees, only bumblebees, and only non-bumblebees. Our models explained nearly 50% of the variation in bee patch use, with equal importance assigned to local habitat configuration and the plant community. Flower abundance was the best indicator of patch use, followed by distance to forest edge, site productivity and proportion forest cover. Contrary to previous findings, flower diversity had weak, yet negative effects on patch use after accounting for covariance with other factors. Although all bees most frequently visited plots with high flower densities, bumblebees preferentially used edge habitats, while non-bumblebees were mostly found in productive grassland areas with access to forest habitat. Our results show that small-scale habitat configuration can have direct effects on bee patch use as strong as or stronger than those of the flower patch itself. Further, the exact habitat configuration that drives bee patch choices is likely to vary among groups. This suggests that habitat configuration should be considered in bee conservation efforts.",,,,"Bennett, Jonathan/K-4405-2014; Cahill, James F/B-6147-2015; Bennett, Jonathan A/J-5839-2013","Bennett, Jonathan/0000-0001-5617-7524; Cahill, James F/0000-0002-4110-1516; Bennett, Jonathan A/0000-0001-5617-7524",,,,,,,,,,,,1439-1791,1618-0089,,,,,2014,15,3,,,,,260,268,,10.1016/j.baae.2014.03.004,,,,,,,WOS:000338606300008,,,,,

On the other hand, urban land use can potentially be beneficial to pollinators through the presence of urban gardens and parks which are usually designed to ensure abundant flowering. However, little is known about the effects of urban land use on bees and the pollination services they provide. In an urban-pen-urban gradient around Leuven, Belgium we studied flower visitation rates to, and seed set of Trifolium repens (white clover) in public lawns. T. repens is an obligatory outcrossing plant and is therefore sensitive to reductions in pollinator services. We related our results to both local and regional variables using Boosted Regression Trees. The two variables that best explained the variability in visitation rates and seed set were the amount of green areas (gardens, parks, grasslands) in the surroundings and the abundance of T. repens in the lawns. Surprisingly, an increasing amount of green areas in the surroundings had a negative effect on both flower visitation rates to, and seed set of T. repens. Flower visitation rates by bumblebees responded positively to urban land use resulting in higher visitation rates and increased seed set in the more urban sites. This may point either to increased abundance of bumblebees in more urban sites or to a concentration effect of bumblebees in our urban study sites due to a lack of alternative forage resources. Responses will likely differ for other bee and plant species, but this shows that at least for T. repens, pollination is not compromised by urban land use.

Modern genomic approaches have made it possible to identify the molecular underpinnings of varied behavioral phenotypes. By examining species with plastic phenotypes we have begun to understand the dynamic and flexible nature of neural transcriptomes and identified gene modules associated with variation in social and reproductive behaviors in diverse species. Importantly, it is becoming increasingly clear that some candidate genes and gene networks are involved in complex social behaviors across even divergent species, yet few comparative transcriptomics studies have been conducted that examine a specific behavior across species. We discuss the implications of a range of important and insightful studies that have increased our understanding of the neurogenomics of behavioral plasticity. Despite its successes, behavioral genomics has been criticized for its lack of hypotheses and causative insights. We propose here a novel avenue to overcome some of these short-comings by complementing ""forward genomics"" studies (i.e., from phenotype to behaviorally relevant gene modules) with a ""reverse genomics"" approach (i.e., manipulating novel gene modules to examine effects on behavior, hormones, and the genome itself) to examine the functional causes and consequences of differential gene expression patterns. We discuss how several established approaches (such as pharmacological manipulations of a novel candidate pathway, fine scale mapping of novel candidate gene expression in the brain, or identifying direct targets of a novel transcription factor of interest) can be used in combination with the analysis of the accompanying neurogenomic responses to reveal unexpected biological processes. The integration of forward and reverse genomics will move the field beyond statistical associations and yield great insights into the neural and molecular control of social behavior and its evolution.",,,,"Harris, Rayna M/B-7091-2015; Hofmann, Hans A/E-4538-2016","Harris, Rayna M/0000-0002-7943-5650; Hofmann, Hans A/0000-0002-3335-330X",,,,,,,,,,,,0065-2598,2214-8019,978-94-007-7347-9; 978-94-007-7346-2,,,,2014,781,,,,,,149,168,,10.1007/978-94-007-7347-9__8,10.1007/978-94-007-7347-9,,,,,,WOS:000333362800008,24277299,,,,

To identify spatial and temporal variation in foraging behaviour at the individual level, we studied at two nests the solitary foragers of the Australian jack jumper ant Myrmecia croslandi TAYLOR, 1991. These ants are strictly diurnal and active only between October and April. Foragers of Myrmecia croslandi have a long life span (about a year) and we took advantage of this to determine the variation in their time of activity and foraging paths over a two-year period. By tracking the outbound paths of foraging ants using a Differential GPS we discovered that: (a) individual ants use very different routes to reach the same destination; (b) distance travelled by foragers was longest (up to 15 m) when they travelled to nest-specific eucalypt trees on which they foraged either for prey or tended to sap-sucking insects; (c) and ants made short forays (< 2 m) into non-tree sectors where they exclusively hunted for prey. Individual foragers exhibited temporal fidelity based on their nest departure times, and could be classified as those active (a) all day, (b) only within eight hours after sunrise and (c) only after eight hours after sunrise.

J,"Jandt, JM; Dornhaus, A",,,,"Jandt, Jennifer M.; Dornhaus, Anna",,,Bumblebee response thresholds and body size: does worker diversity increase colony performance?,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although models of colony organization in social insects often rely on the assumption that within-group variation increases group performance, empirical support for this is mostly confined to studies of genetic variation. However, workers in ant or bee colonies often vary in behaviour and morphology even when genetic variation is low. Bumblebees provide a unique opportunity to explore the consequences of such variation: colonies have a wide range of worker body sizes compared to other social bee species, and workers also vary in response thresholds (i.e. stimulus levels at which workers respond by performing a task), in spite of queens being singly mated (and thus, low genetic variation). Here we test how body size and response threshold diversity affect colony performance in two unrelated in-nest tasks (thermoregulation and undertaking). We manipulated worker diversity using worker removals to restrict threshold or body size variation within the colony. We also quantified the degree of intracolony variation across colonies and related this to colony performance. In general, colonies took longer to cool the nest after bees were removed, but there was no significant effect of treatment on fanning or undertaking success. Furthermore, when intracolony variation was analysed as a continuous variable, we found no effect on colony-level thermoregulation or undertaking performance. Instead, average threshold was a more useful predictor of thermoregulation success, and colonies with a narrower range of size variation had more success at undertaking. These results emphasize the importance of understanding how different types of variation (e.g. behavioural, morphological, etc.) contribute to colony performance.

Based on field records collected over the past two decades in Western Europe, we report on the rapid geographic range expansion in Colletes hederae, a solitary bee species. To characterize how this expansion shaped the distribution of genetic diversity within and among populations, we performed a genetic analysis based on the sequencing of three nuclear loci (RNAp, CAD and WgL). We then simulated the evolution of DNA sequences under a spatially explicit model of coalescence to compare different hypotheses regarding the mode of colonization associated with this rapid expansion and to identify those that are most consistent with the observed molecular data. Our genetic analyses indicate that the range expansion was not associated with an important reduction in genetic diversity, even in the most recently colonized area in the United Kingdom. Moreover, little genetic differentiation was observed among populations. Our comparative analysis of simulated data sets indicates that the observed genetic data are more consistent with a demographic scenario involving relatively high migration rates than with a scenario based on a high reproduction rate associated with few migrants. In the light of these results, we discuss the factors that might have contributed to the rapid geographic range expansion of this pollen-specialist solitary bee species across Western Europe.",,,,"Dellicour, Simon/AAE-9054-2020","Dellicour, Simon/0000-0001-9558-1052; Vereecken, Nicolas/0000-0002-8858-4623",,,,,,,,,,,,1010-061X,1420-9101,,,,JAN,2014,27,1,,,,,116,132,,10.1111/jeb.12280,,,,,,,WOS:000329254500011,24330186,,,,

Organisms use this sense for orientation purposes during migrations and traveling long distances. The sudden loss and disappearance of honey bees from a hive or apiary has been plaguing beekeepers for more than a century. This age-old disorder predates virtually all herbicides and pesticides, many diseases or pests and honey bee management protocols. To investigate possible involvement of a magnetoreception disorder (MRD) with loss of forager homing abilities: A. magnetized wires were glued to their abdomens; B. foragers were exposed to artificially induced fluctuating magnetic fields; and C. untreated foragers' return rates were monitored during naturally occurring disturbances to Earth's magnetosphere. Treated and untreated foragers were released at varying distances from their hives and their return rates were monitored. Significant differences in their return rates indicated that interactions existed between forager losses and exposure to both static and oscillating magnetic fields, as well as during fluctuations in the Earth's magnetosphere. In addition, D. decreases in untreated forager return rates also correlated with increasing intensity of extraterrestrial protons that entered Earth's atmosphere. Finally, winter colony losses in the northeast USA also correlated with annual geomagnetic storm occurrences. Collectively, these five observations indicate that coronal eruptions on the Sun are involved with interference of a forager's magnetoreception sense here on Earth. How abnormal magnetic fields and fluctuations relate to the epidemiology of honey bee losses is consistent with their behaviour and development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8839,2078-6913,,,,,2014,53,4,,,,,452,465,,10.3896/IBRA.1.53.4.15,,,,,,,WOS:000344516000006,,,,,

Specifically, little is known about the collection of pollen, an essential component of larval and adult bee food, and whether pollen collection patterns change across habitats, spatial scales, and/or native and non-native floral resource distributions. In this study, the pollen collection patterns and preferences of the yellow-faced bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, were examined across a gradient of natural and human-altered sites. Three hypotheses were investigated: (i) landscape-scale (2km) but not local-scale (250m) floral and habitat composition factors are most predictive of bee-collected pollen composition; (ii) collection of native pollen is greater in sites with greater proportions of natural habitat at landscape scales; and (iii) bees exhibit greater preference' for native versus non-native pollen.Bombus vosnesenskii collected more species of pollen when landscape-scale riparian forest cover was low but local- and landscape-scale floral species richness was high. Also, B.vosnesenskii collected pollen from a wide range of plant families and did not exhibit a significant preference for native versus non-native species. Finally, preference analysis indicated that the only significant preference exhibited by B.vosnesenskii during the study period was for Heteromeles arbutifolia, a native shrub.

These displays sometimes express discrete polymorphisms; however, the adaptive drivers of such variation are not well understood. Here, we explore a previously unknown color polymorphism in the orb-web spider Gasteracantha fornicata. We discovered that in North Queensland, Australia, female spiders exhibit dorsal bands appearing (to the human observer) either white or yellow and characterized by sigmoidal spectral curves centered on approx. 447 and 496nm, respectively. Based on sensory drive theory, we hypothesized that morphs may be alternatively favored by the switch in ambient viewing conditions engendered by sunny vs. cloudy skies. We addressed this hypothesis indirectly by studying morph frequencies across a approx. 200km geographic gradient of solar exposure (a surrogate for cloudiness), and by investigating the phenotypic signature of catch success via a resource stress experiment and in wild spiders. Our data indicate substantial geographic variation in morph frequency, with white morphs dominating at more cloudy northern locations. Rather than a gradual cline, morph frequency inverted mid-way along this range and was closely fit by a logistic relationship with latitude. Experimentally restricted access to larger prey caused spiders to lose more mass than size and to exhibit less bright dorsal markings. Wild-sampled spiders from two localities of divergent morph frequency indicated no differences in residual mass, but intriguingly, the white morph was larger and heavier (than the yellow morph) where it was relatively rare. Our data hint at negative frequency dependence, but remain broadly consistent with a sensory drive explanation based on cloudiness, and we suggest these as worthy avenues for closer investigation.",,,,"Edwards, Will/M-6652-2015; Congdon, Bradley C/J-9181-2012","Edwards, Will/0000-0001-8981-7479; Congdon, Bradley C/0000-0002-8751-0892; Kemp, Darrell/0000-0002-5845-5513",,,,,,,,,,,,0179-1613,1439-0310,,,,DEC,2013,119,12,,,,,1126,1137,,10.1111/eth.12172,,,,,,,WOS:000330123000010,,,,,

We aimed to assess the impact of oilseed rape on the pollination of wild plants and bee abundance during and after oilseed-rape bloom, including effects on crop-noncrop spillover at landscape and adjacent-field scales. We focused on two shrub species (hawthorn Crataegus spp., dog rose Rosa canina) and adjacent herb flowering in forest edges, connected hedges, and isolated hedges in Lower Saxony, Germany. We selected 35 landscape circles of 1 km radius, differing in the amount of oilseed rape; 18 were adjacent to oilseed rape and 17 to cereal fields, and we quantified bee density via pan traps at all sites. Adjacent oilseed rape positively affected fruit mass and seed number per fruit of simultaneously flowering hawthorn (no effect on dog rose, which flowers after the oilseed rape bloom). At the landscape scale, oilseed rape had a negative effect on bumble bee density in the hedges during flowering due to dilution of pollinators per unit area and the consequently intensified competition between oilseed rape and wild shrubs, but a positive effect after flowering when bees moved to the hedges, which still provided resources. In contrast, positive landscape-scale effects of oilseed rape were found throughout the season in forest edges, suggesting that edges support nesting activity and enhanced food resources. Our results show that oilseed rape effects on bee abundances and pollination success in seminatural habitats depend on the spatial and temporal scale considered and on the habitat type, the wild plant species, and the time of crop flowering. These scale-dependent positive and negative effects should be considered in evaluations of landscape-scale configuration and composition of crops. Food resources provided by mass-flowering crops should be most beneficial for landscape-wide enhancement of wild bee populations if seminatural habitats are available, providing (1) nesting resources and (2) continuous flowering resources during the season.",,,,"Batary, Peter/A-2349-2008; Batary, Peter/AAF-1173-2019; Holzschuh, Andrea/X-8989-2018; Baldi, Andras/A-7501-2008; Jauker, Birgit/G-9740-2014; Tscharntke, Teja/N-5123-2014; Jauker, Birgit/A-6281-2009","Batary, Peter/0000-0002-1017-6996; Batary, Peter/0000-0002-1017-6996; Holzschuh, Andrea/0000-0002-5235-4746; Baldi, Andras/0000-0001-6063-3721; Jauker, Birgit/0000-0001-5027-9351; Jauker, Birgit/0000-0001-5027-9351",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,DEC,2013,23,8,,,,,1938,1946,,10.1890/12-2012.1,,,,,,,WOS:000328568400015,24555319,,,,

Hence, conservationists and bee keepers are debating about the consequences of beekeeping for the conservation of wild bees in nature reserves. We observed flower-visiting bees on flowers of Calluna vulgaris in sites differing in the distance to the next honey-bee hive and in sites with hives present and absent in the Luneburger Heath, Germany. Additionally, we counted wild bee ground nests in sites that differ in their distance to the next hive and wild bee stem nests and stem-nesting bee species in sites with hives present and absent. We did not observe fewer honey bees or higher wild bee flower visits in sites with different distances to the next hive (up to 1,229 m). However, wild bees visited fewer flowers and honey bee visits increased in sites containing honey-bee hives and in sites containing honey-bee hives we found fewer stem-nesting bee species. The reproductive success, measured as number of nests, was not affected by distance to honey-bee hives or their presence but by availability and characteristics of nesting resources. Our results suggest that beekeeping in the Luneburg Heath can affect the conservation of stem-nesting bee species richness but not the overall reproduction either of stem-nesting or of ground-nesting bees. Future experiments need control sites with larger distances than 500 m to hives.

Dances are composed of repeated waggle runs, which encode the distance and direction vector from the hive or swarm to the resource. Distance is encoded in the duration of the waggle run, and direction is encoded in the angle of the dancer's body relative to vertical. Glass-walled observation hives enable researchers to observe or video, and decode waggle runs. However, variation in these signals makes it impossible to determine exact locations advertised. We present a Bayesian duration to distance calibration curve using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations that allows us to quantify how accurately distance to a food resource can be predicted from waggle run durations within a single dance. An angular calibration shows that angular precision does not change over distance, resulting in spatial scatter proportional to distance. We demonstrate how to combine distance and direction to produce a spatial probability distribution of the resource location advertised by the dance.

The aim of this study was to investigate how the previous experience of honeybee foragers at a feeding location affects their persistence at that location once food is no longer available. We hypothesised that persistence would be greater to locations that were more rewarding (closer to the hive, higher concentration of sucrose solution), for which a bee had greater prior experience (0.5-h vs. 2-h training access), and at times of the year of lower nectar availability in the environment. We studied individually marked worker bees from four colonies trained to sucrose-solution feeders. Our results support most of these predictions. Persistence, measured both in duration and number of visits, was greater to locations that previously offered sucrose solution of higher concentration (2m vs. 1m) or were closer to the hive (20m vs. 450m). Persistence was also greater in bees that had longer access at the feeder before the syrup was terminated (2h vs. 0.5h). However, contrary to our prediction, persistence was not higher in the season of the lowest nectar availability in the environment in the study year.

This hard optimization problem consists of embedding an n-vertex graph into the cycle C-n, such that the minimum distance (measured in the cycle) of adjacent vertices is maximized. It constitutes a natural extension of the well-known antibandwidth problem, and can be viewed as the dual problem of the cyclic bandwidth problem. Our method hybridizes the artificial bee colony methodology with tabu search to obtain high-quality solutions in short computational times. Artificial bee colony is a recent swarm intelligence technique based on the intelligent foraging behavior of honeybees. The performance of this algorithm is basically determined by two search strategies, an initialization scheme that is employed to construct initial solutions and a method for generating neighboring solutions. On the other hand, tabu search is an adaptive memory programming methodology introduced in the eighties to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems. Our hybrid approach adapts some elements of both methodologies, artificial bee colony and tabu search, to the cyclic antibandwidth problem.

Such reader collision must be minimized to avoid the faulty or miss reads. This paper, therefore, aims to use a successful swarm intelligence technique called artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to minimize both the reader-to-reader interference and total system transaction time in RFID reader networks. As the RFID network scheduling model formulated in this work is a discrete problem, a binary version of artificial bee colony (BABC) algorithm is proposed in this study. Unlike the original ABC algorithm, the proposed BABC represents a food source as a discrete binary variable and applies discrete operators to change the foraging trajectories of the employed bees, onlookers and scouts in the probability that a coordinate will take on a zero or one value. Numerical results for four test cases with different scales, which ranging from 10 to 200 readers, have been presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1546-1955,1546-1963,,,,DEC,2013,10,12,,,SI,,2877,2883,,10.1166/jctn.2013.3294,,,,,,,WOS:000326198400014,,,,,

Bee colonies exemplify a high level of intrinsic interdependence and co-ordination among its members, and algorithms inspired from the bee colonies have gained recent prominence in the field of swarm based metaheuristics. The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm was recently developed, by simulating the minimalistic foraging model of honeybees in search of food sources, for solving real-parameter, non-convex, and non-smooth optimization problems. The single parameter perturbation in classical ABC resulted in fairly commendable performance for simple problems without epistasis of variables ( separable). However, it suffered from narrow search zone and slow convergence which eventually led to poor exploitation tendency. Even with the increase in dimensionality, a significant deterioration was observed in the ability of ABC to locate the optimum in a huge search volume. Some of the probable shortcomings in the basic ABC approach, as observed, are the single parameter perturbation instead of a multiple one, ignoring the fitness to reward ratio while selecting food sites, and most importantly the absence of environmental factors in the algorithm design. Research has shown that spatial environmental factors play a crucial role in insect locomotion and foragers seem to learn the direction to be undertaken based on the relative analysis of its proximal surroundings. Most importantly, the mapping of the forager locomotion from three dimensional search spaces to a multidimensional solution space calls forth the implementation of multiple modification schemes. Based on the fundamental observation pertaining to the dynamics of ABC, this article proposes an improved variant of ABC aimed at improving the optimizing ability of the algorithm over an extended set of problems. The hybridization of the proposed fitness learning mechanism with a weighted selection scheme and proximity based stimuli helps to achieve a fine blending of explorative and exploitative behaviour by enhancing both local and global searching ability of the algorithm. This enhances the ability of the swarm agents to detect optimal regions in the unexplored fitness basins. With respect to its immediate surroundings, a proximity based component is added to the normal positional modification of the onlookers and is enacted through an improved probability selection scheme that takes the TIE (total reward to distance) ratio metric into account. The biologicallymotivated, hybridized variant of ABC achieves a statistically superior performance on majority of the tested benchmark instances, as compared to some of the most prominent state-of-the-art algorithms, as is demonstrated through a detailed experimental evaluation and verified statistically.

Social bees provide a good model for this and, whilst there are published descriptions of their behaviour on initial learning flights close to the colony, it is still unclear how bees find floral resources over hundreds of metres and how these flights become directed foraging trips. We investigated the spatial ecology of exploration by radar tracking bumblebees, and comparing the flight trajectories of bees with differing experience. The bees left the colony within a day or two of eclosion and flew in complex loops of ever-increasing size around the colony, exhibiting Levy-flight characteristics constituting an optimal searching strategy. This mathematical pattern can be used to predict how animals exploring individually might exploit a patchy landscape. The bees' groundspeed, maximum displacement from the nest and total distance travelled on a trip increased significantly with experience. More experienced bees flew direct paths, predominantly flying upwind on their outward trips although forage was available in all directions. The flights differed from those of naive honeybees: they occurred at an earlier age, showed more complex looping, and resulted in earlier returns of pollen to the colony.

This spatial pattern is believed to emerge from simple behavioral rules that specify how the queen moves, where foragers deposit honey/pollen and how honey/pollen is consumed from cells. Prior work has shown that a set of such rules can explain the formation of the allocation pattern starting from an empty comb. We show that these rules cannot maintain the pattern once the brood start to vacate their cells, and we propose new, biologically realistic rules that better sustain the observed allocation pattern. We analyze the three resulting models by performing hundreds of simulation runs over many gestational periods and a wide range of parameter values. We develop new metrics for pattern assessment and employ them in analyzing pattern retention over each simulation run. Applied to our simulation results, these metrics show alteration of an accepted model for honey/pollen consumption based on local information can stabilize the cell allocation pattern over time. We also show that adding global information, by biasing the queen's movements towards the center of the comb, expands the parameter regime over which pattern retention occurs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Measuring the derivative allows us to deduce the perceived reward function. The derivative function of the perceived reward equation gives the rate of change of the reward perceived for each reward value. This approach depends on presenting free-flying foragers with a series of two different rewards presented simultaneously (i.e., two-choice, binomial tests).

Here, we investigate the effects of structured, unsteady flow (the von Karman vortex street behind a cylinder) on the flight performance of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens). Bumblebees are 'all-weather' foragers and thus frequently experience variable aerial conditions, ranging from fully mixed, turbulent flow to unsteady, structured vortices near objects such as branches and stems. We examined how bumblebee flight performance differs in unsteady versus smooth flow, as well as how the orientation of unsteady flow structures affects their flight performance, by filming bumblebees flying in a wind tunnel under various flow conditions. The three-dimensional flight trajectories and orientations of bumblebees were quantified in each of three flow conditions: (1) smooth flow, (2) the unsteady wake of a vertical cylinder (inducing strong lateral disturbances) and (3) the unsteady wake of a horizontal cylinder (inducing strong vertical disturbances). In both unsteady conditions, bumblebees attenuated the disturbances induced by the wind quite effectively, but still experienced significant translational and rotational fluctuations as compared with flight in smooth flow. Bees appeared to be most sensitive to disturbance along the lateral axis, displaying large lateral accelerations, translations and rolling motions in response to both unsteady flow conditions, regardless of orientation. Bees also displayed the greatest agility around the roll axis, initiating voluntary casting maneuvers and correcting for lateral disturbances mainly through roll in all flow conditions. Both unsteady flow conditions reduced the upstream flight speed of bees, suggesting an increased cost of flight in unsteady flow, with potential implications for foraging patterns and colony energetics in natural, variable wind environments.",,,,,"Ravi, Sridhar/0000-0001-7397-9713",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,NOV,2013,216,22,,,,,4299,4309,,10.1242/jeb.090845,,,,,,,WOS:000326499900025,24031057,,,,

We find the ants have developed large lenses (33 mu m in diameter) and wide rhabdoms (5 mu m in diameter) to make their eyes highly sensitive to low light conditions. To be active at bright light conditions, the ants have developed an extreme pupillary mechanism during which the primary pigment cells constrict the crystalline cone to form a narrow tract of 0.5 mu m wide and 16 mu m long. This pupillary mechanism protects the photoreceptors from bright light, making the eyes less sensitive during the day.

We first consider color pattern variation and identify geographical patterns of B. bifarius color variation using cluster analysis. We then use climate data and a comprehensive set of B. bifarius natural history records with an existing genetic data set to model the distribution of environmentally suitable habitat in western North America and predict pathways of potential gene flow using circuit theory. Resistance distances among populations that incorporate environmental suitability information predict patterns of genetic structure much better than geographic distance or Bayesian clustering alone.

What is the relationship between flowering phenology and pollen occurring in honey sediments? Location: Mediterranean sylvo-pastoral system in Gallura, Sardinia, Italy. Methods: Phytosociological and phenological surveys were performed in a circular area of 1.5 km radius with a small apiary placed in the centre. Polleniferous and nectariferous values of plant communities were assessed based on the cover and the polleniferous and nectariferous value of each constituting species. Honey production was quantified during the main flow (March-June) and subjected to melissopalynological analysis. Data were evaluated by ordination through principal components analysis and principal coordinates analysis. The latter utilized a new index, developed for calculating the phenological distances based on the individual distributions of flowering frequencies. Results: Plant communities richest in species providing pollen and nectar were Rhamnus hedges. There was a close correlation between polleniferous and nectariferous values, suggesting that plant communities are important for honeybee foraging of both resources. The temporal flowering sequence ensured the supply of nectar and pollen throughout the spring season. Pollen foraged from 12 Trifolium species with different flowering phenology was the most abundant. Salix purpurea and Rhamnus alaternus were productive at the beginning of the season, followed by Lavandula stoechas, Echium plantagineum and E.italicum. Conclusions: Plant communities vary in importance for honeybee foraging mainly due to differences in floristic composition and flowering phenology. Communities characterized by human presence (e.g. semi-natural grasslands and hedges) are the most relevant. Some target species (e.g. Trifolium spp.) favoured by grazing livestock ensure foraging for honeybees throughout the season.

Thus, we exploited the well-established RNA interference (RNAi) protocol for Vg knockdown to investigate its downstream effects on microRNA population in honey bee foragers' brain and fat body tissue. To identify microRNAs that are differentially expressed between tissues in control and knockdown foragers, we used mu Paraflo microfluidic oligonucleotide microRNA microarrays.

Behavioural experiments, primarily on social bees and ants, reveal the mechanisms by which these memories are employed for guidance to spatial goals and suggest how the memories, and the processing streams that use them, may be organized. We discuss three types of memory-based guidance which, together, can explain a large part of observed insect spatial behaviour. Two of these, alignment image-matching and positional image-matching, are based on an insect's remembered views of its surroundings: The first uses views to keep to a familiar heading and the second to head towards a familiar place. The third type of guidance is based on a process of path integration by which an insect monitors its distance and direction from its nest through odometric and compass information. To a large degree, these guidance mechanisms appear to involve modular computational systems. We discuss the lack of evidence for cognitive maps in insects, and in particular the evidence against a map based on path integration, in which view-based and path integration memories might be combined.

The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Pulmonaria officinalis is a distylous, perennial rosette hemicryptophyte that is naturalized in Britain. It occurs predominantly in the understory of broadleaved, mixed, open woods rich in hornbeam, beech and oak, but is has also been recorded from hedges, banks alongside streams, (sunken) roadsides, built-up areas, gardens, rubbish tips, yew woodland and, less frequently, coniferous woodland. Its native range stretches from southern Sweden, in the north, to northern Italy, in the south, and from western Germany to Poland and Lithuania. It is most common in central Europe. Pulmonaria officinalis reproduces both by sexual and vegetative means. The underground parts consist of a slowly creeping rhizome with adventitious roots. Despite the presence of an elaiosome that is attractive to ants that likely facilitates seed dispersal, populations often show a significant fine-scale spatial genetic structure and small neighbourhood sizes. The leaves and flowering stalks are covered in hairs of varied length and stiffness, and stems and inflorescences are sparsely covered with glandular hairs. Flowers of P.officinalis are heterostylous, with distinct pin and thrum morphs. The corolla varies from purple, violet or blue to shades of pink and red, or sometimes white. The flowers are mainly pollinated by solitary bees and bumblebees. Pulmonaria officinalis has significantly expanded its distribution in the British Isles since the 18th century, especially in southern England. P.officinalis is currently not regarded as threatened in Europe. Nonetheless, small, isolated populations of the species often show reduced reproductive success and lower genetic diversity, potentially affecting their long-term survival. Preservation of local habitat conditions by regular opening of the forest canopy and restoration of gene flow among populations are required to maintain viable populations of P.officinalis in the long term.",,,,"Jacquemyn, Hans/AAC-4875-2019; Honnay, Olivier/AAH-8625-2019","Jacquemyn, Hans/0000-0001-9600-5794; Honnay, Olivier/0000-0002-4287-8511; Meeus, Sofie/0000-0003-0715-8647",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,,,,,SEP,2013,101,5,,,,,1353,1368,,10.1111/1365-2745.12150,,,,,,,WOS:000323699000027,,,,,

We combined census data and field experiments to disentangle the complex effects of nectar robbing on nectar production rates, pollinator behavior, pollen export, and female reproductive success of Pitcairnia angustifolia. Under natural conditions flowers were visited by four different animal species including a robber-like pollinator and a secondary robber. Natural levels of nectar robbing ranged from 40 to 100%. Natural variation in nectar robbing was not associated with fruit set in any year whereas seed set was weakly positively associated for 1year only. Artificial nectar robbing did not increase nectar production or concentration, did not affect the behavior of long-billed hummingbirds, and when faced with artificially robbed flowers, these visitors behaved as secondary nectar robbers. The number of stigmas within a patch that received pollen dye analogs and the average distance traveled by these analogs were not significantly different between robbing treatments (robbed flowers versus unrobbed flowers), but the maximum distance traveled by these pollen analogs was higher when nectar robbing was not prevented. Overall, the proportion of robbed flowers on an inflorescence had a neutral effect to a weak positive effect on the reproduction of individual plants (i.e. positive association between nectar robbing and fruit set in 2002) even when it clearly changed the behavior of its most efficient pollinator potentially increasing the frequency of nectar robbing within a plant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0913-557X,1442-1984,,,,SEP,2013,28,3,,,,,224,234,,10.1111/j.1442-1984.2012.00388.x,,,,,,,WOS:000323645800007,,,,,

Most studies on bees have defined habitat fragments as remnant patches of floral hosts or forests, overlooking the nesting needs of bees. Their conclusion is that habitat fragmentation is broadly deleterious; however, there are contrasting results in the literature. Insightful studies on habitat fragmentation and bees should consider fragmentation, alteration and loss of nesting habitats-not just patches of forage plants -, as well as the permeability of the surrounding matrix to interpatch movement. Here we investigated the effects of fragmentation caused by urbanization on stingless bee species' composition and richness, as well as the permeability of the surrounding matrix. We collected bees from flowering plants and recorded phytosociological variables of five forest remnants (ranging from 64 ha to 900 ha) in southeastern Brazil. Large fragments did not contain more species per unit area than smaller ones; in fact, we found more species in small fragments, most of which were generalist bees. The presence of more habitat generalist stingless bee species was also correlated to the structure of vegetation in these fragments. In conclusion, the quality of the habitat within a fragment (structure of vegetation) as well as the quality of the matrix has a direct relation to the bee species composition. This can be seen in the direct relationship between structural diversity of the environment and age of the fragments. The matrix that holds the most recent fragments, probably due to the sprawl of the city, is more heterogeneous than the one with the oldest fragments. The most heterogeneous matrices have a certain balance between the trees, buildings and bare soil or herbaceous vegetation coverage, making the array less impermeable to bees.",,,,"Loyola, Rafael/A-4425-2008; Aguiar, Ludmilla/H-7339-2015; Loyola, Rafael/S-3978-2019; Aguiar, Ludmilla M S/J-7659-2012","Loyola, Rafael/0000-0001-5323-2735; Aguiar, Ludmilla/0000-0002-9180-5052; Loyola, Rafael/0000-0001-5323-2735; Aguiar, Ludmilla M S/0000-0002-9180-5052; Antonini, Yasmine/0000-0002-5582-8193",,,,,,,,,,,,1083-8155,1573-1642,,,,SEP,2013,16,3,,,,,527,541,,10.1007/s11252-012-0281-0,,,,,,,WOS:000323220800009,,,,,

For pollinators, this has transformed the agrochemical landscape. These chemicals mimic the acetylcholine neurotransmitter and are highly neurotoxic to insects. Their systemic mode of action inside plants means phloemic and xylemic transport that results in translocation to pollen and nectar. Their wide application, persistence in soil and water and potential for uptake by succeeding crops and wild plants make neonicotinoids bioavailable to pollinators at sublethal concentrations for most of the year. This results in the frequent presence of neonicotinoids in honeybee hives. At field realistic doses, neonicotinoids cause a wide range of adverse sublethal effects in honeybee and bumblebee colonies, affecting colony performance through impairment of foraging success, brood and larval development, memory and learning, damage to the central nervous system, susceptibility to diseases, hive hygiene etc. Neonicotinoids exhibit a toxicity that can be amplified by various other agrochemicals and they synergistically reinforce infectious agents such as Nosema ceranae which together can produce colony collapse. The limited available data suggest that they are likely to exhibit similar toxicity to virtually all other wild insect pollinators. The worldwide production of neonicotinoids is still increasing.

The way in which species interactions are altered at habitat edges is an emerging concern in conservation biology, with some theories predicting edge-affected habitats to be less stable and exhibit intensified species interactions relative to interior habitats. One little-studied interaction is phoresy, where an individual of one species attaches itself to an individual of another species for the purpose of dispersal. Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are important crop pollinators around the world and at least 10 species of phoretic mites have been associated with various bumble bee species. 2. Here, we investigated changes in the abundance of the introduced European B. terrestris across forest-grassland edges in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, and concomitant changes in the phoretic mite loads on these mobile pollinators. 3. Bumble bees penetrated up to 250 m inside forest fragments, with abundance declining with distance from the anthropogenic matrix habitat. By contrast, phoretic mite loads increased towards the forest interior. Overall, phoretic mite loads on B. terrestris were greatest in the forest canopy, suggesting that this species interaction is intensified in natural habitat compared to that in the anthropogenic land use surrounding forest fragments. 4. Our data indicate that phoretic loads on bumble bees are elevated in forest canopies.

In social insects, behavioural changes are often particularly conspicuous. For example, in many ant species, reproductive sexuals leave their maternal nests and engage in risky mating and dispersal activities. Female sexuals experience, during a short period of time, dramatic changes in terms of behaviour and environmental conditions. But because sexual activities of ants are not easily observed, few studies have quantified in detail how behaviour alters with maturation and mating. We studied how various behavioural traits of Leptothorax gredleri female sexuals, a species in which female sexuals attract males by female calling', change before and after mating. We tested the hypothesis that behavioural variation reflects the altered requirements of queens to adapt to a particular situation. To this end, we compared geotactic, phototactic and locomotor behaviour across a wide range of life stages from lightly coloured, unmated female sexuals to old, mated queens. The results showed that female sexuals of L.gredleri change conspicuously their geotactic, phototactic and locomotor behavioural traits over their life stages. Three different behavioural states were evident (1) from light to dark female sexuals, individuals have negative phototaxis and reduced locomotor activity; (2) mature female sexuals during the daily period of sexual activity have strong phototaxis, negative geotaxis and an important locomotor activity; and (3) freshly mated and old mated queens avoid light and decrease their locomotor activity. These sharp differences in behaviour between stages match the transition from the relative safety of the nest chamber to the adversary world outside the nest, and back.",,,,,"Bernadou, Abel/0000-0001-5600-587X",,,,,,,,,,,,0179-1613,1439-0310,,,,AUG,2013,119,8,,,,,634,643,,10.1111/eth.12103,,,,,,,WOS:000325854800003,,,,,

They have evolved several methods to do this, including compass-directed ""vector"" flights and the use of landmarks. If these hive-centered mechanisms are disrupted, bees revert to searching for the hive, using an optimal L,vy flight searching strategy. The same strategy is adopted when a food source at a known location ceases to be available. Here, we show that the programming for this L,vy strategy does not need to be very sophisticated or clever on the bee's part, as L,vy flight patterns can be derived from the Weber-Fechner law in a bee's odometer. Odometry errors of a different kind occur in desert ants (Cataglyphis spp., Melophorus bagoti). The searching behaviors of these ants are very similar in overall structure to that of honeybees but do not display any L,vy flight characteristics.

Yet, not all species are mobile enough to perform sufficient dispersal. Such passive dispersers may use more mobile animals as dispersal vectors. If multiple potential vectors are available, an active choice can allow to optimize the dispersal process and to determine the distribution of dispersal distances, i.e. an optimal dispersal kernel. We explore dispersal and vector choice in the neotropical flower mite Spadiseius calyptrogynae using a dual approach which combines experiments with an individual-based simulation model. Spadiseius calyptrogynae is found in lowland rainforests in Costa Rica. It inhabits inflorescences of the understorey palm Calyptrogyne ghiesbreghtiana and is phoretic on a number of flower visitors including bats, beetles and stingless bees. We hypothesised that the mites should optimise their dispersal kernel by actively choosing a specific mix of potential phoretic vectors. In a simple olfactometer setup we showed that the flower mites do indeed discriminate between potential vectors. Subsequently we used an individual-based model to analyse the evolutionary forces responsible for the observed patterns of vector choice. The mites combine vectors exhibiting long-distance dispersal with those allowing for more localized dispersal. This results in a fat-tailed dispersal kernel that guarantees the occasional colonization of new host plant patches (long distance) while optimizing the exploitation of clumped resources (local dispersal). Additionally, kin competition results in a preference for small vectors that transport only few individuals at a time. At the same time, these vectors lead to directed dispersal towards suitable habitat, which increases the stability of this very specialized interaction. Our findings can be applied to other phoretic systems but also to vector-based seed dispersal, for example.",,,,"Fronhofer, Emanuel A./J-9784-2013","Fronhofer, Emanuel A./0000-0002-2219-784X",,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,AUG,2013,122,8,,,,,1254,1264,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00503.x,,,,,,,WOS:000321823300015,,,,,

It is believed that hive-mates detect airborne vibrations produced during the waggle phase to acquire distance information and simultaneously detect the body axis during the waggle phase to acquire direction information. It has been further proposed that the orientation of the body axis on the vertical comb is detected by neck hairs (NHs) on the prosternal organ. The afferents of the NHs project into the prothoracic and mesothoracic ganglia and the dorsal subesophageal ganglion (dSEG). This study demonstrates somatotopic organization within the dSEG of the central projections of the mechanosensory neurons of the NHs. The terminals of the NH afferents in dSEG are in close apposition to those of Johnston's organ (JO) afferents. The sensory axons of both terminate in a region posterior to the crossing of the ventral intermediate tract (VIT) and the maxillary dorsal commissures I and III (MxDCI, III) in the subesophageal ganglion.

Greater understanding is needed of the effects of secondary metabolites in nectar on the foraging behaviour and performance of pollinators, and on plant-pollinator interactions. We investigated how nectar-feeding birds, both specialist (white-bellied sunbirds Cinnyris talatala) and generalist (dark-capped bulbuls Pycnonotus tricolor and Cape white-eyes Zosterops virens), respond to artificial nectar containing the alkaloid nicotine, present in nectar of Nicotiana species. Preference tests were carried out with a range of nicotine concentrations (0.1-300 M) in two sucrose concentrations (0.25 and 1 M), and for bulbuls also in two sugars (sucrose and hexose). In addition, we measured short-term feeding patterns in white-bellied sunbirds that were offered nicotine (0-50 M) in 0.63 M sucrose. Both nicotine and sugar concentrations influenced the response of bird pollinators to nicotine. The birds showed dose-dependent responses to nicotine; and their tolerance of high nicotine concentrations was reduced on the dilute 0.25 M sucrose diet, on which they increased consumption to maintain energy intake. White-bellied sunbirds decreased both feeding frequency and feeding duration as the nicotine concentration in artificial nectar increased. Of the three species, bulbuls showed the highest tolerance for nicotine, and sugar type (sucrose or hexose) had no effect. The indifference of bulbuls to nicotine may be related to their primarily frugivorous diet. However, the response of white-eyes to nicotine in the dilute sucrose solution was very similar to that of sunbirds, even though white-eyes are generalist nectar-feeders. Additional testing of other avian nectarivores and different secondary metabolites is required to further elucidate whether generalist bird pollinators, which utilise dilute nectars in which secondary metabolites have stronger deterrent effects, are more tolerant of toxic' nectar.",,,,,"Nicolson, Susan/0000-0001-6024-9383",,,,,,,,,,,,0908-8857,1600-048X,,,,JUL,2013,44,4,,,,,408,416,,10.1111/j.1600-048X.2013.00079.x,,,,,,,WOS:000321327700013,,,,,

A further challenge is to use them to predict changes in the assemblages of other groups. Using data from a study of the impact of land use on biodiversity, the linkages between management drivers, a range of plant functional traits and the overall foraging numbers and assemblage of bees was assessed. Bee foraging numbers were only weakly predicted by plant traits, though bee foraging assemblage was closely related to a number of different groups of plant traits (flower colour and Forage Index, as well as taxonomic group). In turn, the selected traits were significantly correlated to some of the response traits that linked the plant assemblage to management, indicating that there was a predictive pathway from management to bee abundance and assemblage structure. However, models developed with just the environmental drivers proved superior at predicting both bee numbers and assemblage. Plant traits proved to be a moderately effective predictor of bee assemblage structure. However, the use of plant traits as a link between the bees and management did not offer any improvement on models directly developed from management variables. This suggests that the bee assemblage is responding to traits that have not been quantified and that developing these trophic linkage models may have to take a different approach.

We suggest two possible explanations: (1) dance followers have less information about the location of the food source than dancers, who have a better knowledge of the surrounding area; or (2) honeybees lack a precise calibration method for estimating energy needs from waggle-run duration. The effect of foraging experience was confirmed: bees decreased their honey load at departure with repeated trips to a sugar-syrup feeder. Honeybees showed a different pattern of change when the feeder provided soybean flour as a pollen substitute, possibly because honeybees use honey not only as an energy source but also as ""glue"" to form ""balls"" of pollen on their hind legs. Based on our observations that followers of sugar-syrup foragers carry a different amount of honey in their crop than followers of soybean-followers, we suggest that waggle dancers also convey information concerning food type.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,1432-0762,,,,JUL,2013,67,7,,,,,1169,1178,,10.1007/s00265-013-1542-5,,,,,,,WOS:000320024200014,,,,,

We assessed the importance of climatic factors and geographic gradients on the distribution of orchid bees in a severely-fragmented and species-rich tropical forest region in Brazil. Orchid-bee males were attracted to 17 different scent baits and collected in 15 forest sites. In total we captured 11,081 bees from 40 species. Climatic variables explained twice as much of the observed variation in the bee species data set as did pure spatial variation. However, most of the climatic explained variation was spatially structured, indicating that the species and the climatic data have a similar spatial arrangement. In fact, part of the observed latitudinal changes in community composition appears to be explained by a concomitant gradient in precipitation seasonality. Similarly, reduced temperatures and a more seasonal precipitation may help to explain the relative distinctiveness of the fauna from some of the westernmost sites. The level of similarity among the sampled sites, although highly variable, decayed both as function of the climatic and geographic distances among these sites. The greatest pairwise dissimilarities in the composition of the orchid-bee fauna were observed among sites 200-300 km from each other, since in many case those sites were more dissimilar in terms of climate than those further apart. It is suggested that global warming and consequent altered climatic regimes will influence the distribution patterns of orchid bees in a region already threatened by deforestation and forest fragmentation.",,,,"Nemesio, Andre/D-1920-2012; Vasconcelos, Heraldo L/C-3353-2013","Vasconcelos, Heraldo L/0000-0001-6969-7131",,,,,,,,,,,,0960-3115,1572-9710,,,,JUL,2013,22,8,,,,,1647,1661,,10.1007/s10531-013-0500-x,,,,,,,WOS:000321628800005,,,,,

These cryptic species have, until now, largely been grouped together in ecological studies, and so little is known about their individual colony densities, foraging ranges or habitat requirements, which can be influenced by land use at a landscape scale. We used mass-flowering oilseed rape fields as locations to sample bees of this complex, as well as the second most common visitor to oilseed rape B. lapidarius, and molecular RFLP methods to distinguish between the cryptic species. We then used microsatellite genotyping to identify sisters and estimate colony densities, and related both proportions of cryptic species and their colony densities to the composition of the landscape surrounding the fields. We found B. lucorum was the most common member of the complex present in oilseed rape followed by B. terrestris. B. cryptarum was also present in all but one site, with higher proportions found in the east of the study area. High numbers of bumblebee colonies were estimated to be using oilseed rape fields as a forage resource, with B. terrestris colony numbers higher than previous estimates from non-mass-flowering fields. We also found that the cryptic species responded differently to surrounding landscape composition: both relative proportions of B. cryptarum in samples and colony densities of B. lucorum were negatively associated with the amount of arable land in the landscape, while proportions and colony densities of other species did not respond to landscape variables at the scale measured. This suggests that the cryptic species have different ecological requirements (which may be scale-dependent) and that oilseed rape can be an important forage resource for many colonies of bumblebees.

Many current theoretical models focus on the effect of floral resources' density on the net outcome of these indirect plantplant interactions, often neglecting the identity of plant species in the communities and especially the species' spatial pattern. To fill this gap, we created a spatially explicit model whose goal was to study the interplay between relative densities and spatial distribution patterns of two plant species differing in their attractiveness for pollinators. Since theory predicts that pollinator behaviour strongly governs the outcome of pollination, we allowed the pollinators to systematically change their plant preferences based on their foraging experience. Thus the interplay between density and spatial patterns of plants was tested over a continuum of behaviours from specialists to generalists. Our most striking finding was that reproductive success of the less attractive species was affected in an opposite way by spatial patterns depending on whether the species had relatively low or high densities. Namely, when the less attractive species was highly abundant, its survival was higher when aggregated in large monospecific patches than when uniformly distributed. On the other hand, when the attractive species was more abundant, the less attractive species survived better when uniformly distributed. These results were consistent as long as the scale of the plant spatial aggregation was similar to or larger than the pollinators' detection range. Our results suggest that aggregated plant spatial patterns manipulate pollinator behaviour by trapping them within monospecific patches. This effect was sufficiently strong to enhance the survival of a competitively inferior species and hence to act in a way similar to the more familiar niche or temporal separation among plant species.",,,,"Seifan, Merav/Q-1654-2015","Seifan, Merav/0000-0002-2830-5450",,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,,,,,JUN,2013,122,6,,,,,867,880,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20801.x,,,,,,,WOS:000319408300007,,,,,

It is important to understand the way they move in agricultural landscapes if we are to conserve them and benefit from their activity as pollinators. We surveyed bees using directional flight interception (Malaise) traps over a 1-year period in two agricultural landscapes in south-east Queensland, Australia. We placed traps at the ecotone between crops and remnant vegetation to establish the pattern of movement between these habitats. Species richness in these landscapes (70) was high relative to that in comparable studies. Some bees were active year round, but most were caught in the period September to March. Across the whole assemblage there was a significant pattern where more species were detected leaving rather than entering remnant vegetation. The same bias was true for the number of individuals of the two most abundant species (Homalictus urbanus and Apis mellifera). Species exclusively found in crops were smaller on average (and therefore have smaller foraging range) than their non-crop counterparts. Together, these patterns indicate that while bees are abundant in crop habitat, the remnant vegetation is important as the point of origin for bee movements, and the riparian remnant in particular is richer than the dry native remnant. Compositional similarity among samples was significantly explained by landscape but also movement direction (i.e. to or from the riparian remnant) because different species showed different patterns of response.

Two explanations for these relationships have been proposed: (1) initially, social species are more likely to become parasitic on relatively closely related social species, because they share life history, physiological and behavioural traits that allow successful integration within the host colony; and (2) social parasites have evolved directly from their host lineage via sympatric speciation. Comparative approaches, covering multiple origins and intermediate evolutionary stages, are needed to determine which of these possibilities is more likely. We use molecular phylogenetics to examine multiple origins of parasitism in the bee tribe Allodapini. We identify seven origins resulting in obligate social parasitism (inquilinism), one origin of facultative social parasitism, which was followed by subsequent speciation and where both daughter species remained facultatively parasitic, and one case of frequent facultative heterospecific co-nesting that probably represents incipient social parasitism. All hostparasite lineage pairs show strong phylogenetic affinities, but only the case of facultative heterospecific nesting involves true sister species relationships. Our results are consistent with the range of parasitic relationships that are expected under an allopatric model for the origin of social parasitism, but are highly problematic for a sympatric speciation model.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 320331.",,,,"Tierney, Simon/H-2410-2015; Tierney, Simon/O-6911-2019","Tierney, Simon/0000-0002-8812-6753; Tierney, Simon/0000-0002-8812-6753",,,,,,,,,,,,0024-4066,1095-8312,,,,JUN,2013,109,2,,,,,320,331,,10.1111/bij.12043,,,,,,,WOS:000318809500008,,,,,

With agricultural intensification, increasing urbanisation is among the main drivers of habitat loss. Consequently studies focusing on pollinator community structure along urbanisation gradients have increased in recent years. However, few studies have investigated how urbanisation affects plant-pollinator interaction networks. Here we assessed modifications of plant-pollinator interactions along an urbanisation gradient based on the study of their morphological relationships. Methodology/Principal Findings: Along an urbanisation gradient comprising four types of landscape contexts (semi-natural, agricultural, suburban, urban), we set up experimental plant communities containing two plant functional groups differing in their morphological traits (""open flowers'' and ""tubular flowers''). Insect visitations on these communities were recorded to build plant-pollinator networks. A total of 17 857 interactions were recorded between experimental plant communities and flower-visitors. The number of interactions performed by flower-visitors was significantly lower in urban landscape context than in semi-natural and agricultural ones. In particular, insects such as Syrphidae and solitary bees that mostly visited the open flower functional group were significantly impacted by urbanisation, which was not the case for bumblebees. Urbanisation also impacted the generalism of flower-visitors and we detected higher interaction evenness in urban landscape context than in agricultural and suburban ones. Finally, in urban context, these modifications lowered the potential reproductive success of the open flowers functional group. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings show that open flower plant species and their specific flower-visitors are especially sensitive to increasing urbanisation. These results provide new clues to improve conservation measures within urbanised areas in favour of specialist flower-visitors. To complete this functional approach, studies using networks resolved to the species level along urbanised gradients would be required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,May-22,2013,8,5,,,,,,,e63421,10.1371/journal.pone.0063421,,,,,,,WOS:000320362700019,23717421,,,,

For the purpose of estimating parameters of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) model, and inspired by the foraging behavior of bacteria and bees, a hybrid artificial bee colony (HABC) algorithm is proposed. The HABC uses an improved solution search equation that mimics the chemotactic effect of bacteria to enhance the local search ability. To avoid premature convergence and improve search accuracy, the adaptive Boltzmann selection scheme is adopted, which adjusts selective probabilities in different stages. Performance testing has been conducted on some typical benchmark functions. The results demonstrate that the HABC outperforms other methods (BIPOA, PSOPS and two improved GAS) in both convergence speed and accuracy. The proposed approach is applied to estimate the PEMFC model parameters and the satisfactory model predictive curves are obtained. More experimental results in different search ranges and validate strategies indicate that HABC is an efficient technique for the parameter estimation problem of PEMFC.

Head width was a slightly better predictor of male weights, while IT span was a slightly better predictor of worker weights. IT span and head width changed little by drying.

Bee abundance and richness were higher in diversified and organic fields and in landscapes comprising more high-quality habitats; bee richness on conventional fields with low diversity benefited most from high-quality surrounding land cover.

Our study describes the consequences of edge creation over two successive stages in the life cycle of a hemi-parasitic mistletoe (Tristerix corymbosus), which determine its reproductive success, in temperate austral forests. We assessed how flower production and pollinator visits change with distance to the nearest forest edge and how these changes affect fruit set, fruit and seed size, and fruit removal by seed dispersers. Edge effects were dominated by fruit removal, which increased with the distance to the edge, height in the canopy and fruit availability. As a result, plant reproduction (in terms of seeds produced and fruits removed, which putatively leads to higher seed dispersal) decreased strongly near to forest edges. In contrast, visitation rates of the main pollinator (the hummingbird) were unaffected by edges, and their strong effects on fruit set (including the alleviation of quality pollen limitation arising in the forest interior) might be mitigating the decrease in bumblebee visitation near to forest edges. Synthesis. Our study shows clearly how secondary and tertiary responses to forest edges acted in opposite directions (increasing or decreasing plant reproductive performance), highlighting the need to study several successive processes that impact upon plant fitness under disturbance. Preserving relatively large patches of old-growth forest with low perimeter/area ratios would be key to the habitat requirements of the main disperser and pollinator and thus for mistletoe reproductive performance.",,,,"Magrach, Ainhoa/B-1038-2012; Larrinaga, Asier/B-3826-2013; Santamaria, Luis/C-1438-2012","Magrach, Ainhoa/0000-0003-2155-7556; Larrinaga, Asier/0000-0001-6813-8784; Santamaria, Luis/0000-0002-5072-2912",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,MAY,2013,101,3,,,,,713,721,,10.1111/1365-2745.12083,,,,,,,WOS:000318186800017,,,,,

This makes them excellent candidates for studying mechanisms of learning and memory at both an individual and a population level. Here we introduce a novel method of honey bee conditioning: APIS, the Automatic Performance Index System. In an enclosed walking arena where the interior is covered with an electric grid, presentation of odors from either end can be combined with weak electric shocks to form aversive associations. To quantify behavioral responses, we continuously monitor the movement of the bee by an automatic tracking system. We found that escapes from one side to the other, changes in velocity as well as distance and time spent away from the punished odor are suitable parameters to describe the bee's learning capabilities. Our data show that in a short-term memory test the response rate for the conditioned stimulus (CS) in APIS correlates well with response rate obtained from conventional Proboscis Extension Response (PER)-conditioning. Additionally, we discovered that bees modulate their behavior to aversively learned odors by reducing their rate, speed and magnitude of escapes and that both generalization and extinction seem to be different between appetitive and aversive stimuli. The advantages of this automatic system make it ideal for assessing learning rates in a standardized and convenient way, and its flexibility adds to the toolbox for studying honey bee behavior.",,,,"Galizia, C Giovanni/A-1771-2009","Galizia, C Giovanni/0000-0001-8292-6031; Kirkerud, Nicholas/0000-0002-8310-5523",,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5153,,,,,Apr-17,2013,7,,,,,,,,29,10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00029,,,,,,,WOS:000317591600001,23616753,,,,

Increased production of novel crops for bioenergy is causing changes in agricultural practice, but the effects on different pollinating taxa have not yet been quantified. However, the major pollinating groups (social bees, solitary bees, hoverflies and butterflies) are likely to respond differently to changes in land use and shifts in crop cultivation patterns. We assessed the impacts of two bioenergy crops, oilseed rape Brassica napus L. and Miscanthus Miscanthus X giganteus on (i) the diversity and abundance of four taxonomic groups of pollinating insects, (ii) insect community composition, (iii) floral resources and (iv) nesting sites for bumblebees, by comparing bioenergy crops with conventional arable and grass crops in a large network of commercial fields. We found that although there were more bumblebees in oilseed rape fields, conventional crops and bioenergy crops did not differ greatly in species richness of most pollinator groups, although more floral resources were found in the bioenergy crops. However, solitary bees were more abundant and species rich in energy crops than conventional wheat, and more trap-nesting bees and wasps were found in Miscanthus than oilseed rape. In addition, novel assemblages of solitary bees were found in the bioenergy crops. All pollinator groups, and flowering plants, were more abundant in field margins than in the centre of crop fields. Although there were no differences among crop types, nest-searching bumblebees were confined to field margins. This highlights the importance of field margins as forage and nesting habitat for pollinators in farmland. Synthesis and applications. Differential responses to field-scale growth of bioenergy crops were displayed by the taxonomic groups studied, suggesting that effects on biodiversity cannot be generalized from studies based on a small suite of taxonomic groups and must include a range of taxa for overarching results. To optimize habitat for pollinators in agricultural areas, our data suggest that a diversity of crop types at small scales may have positive impacts and supports appropriate management and conservation of field margins and hedgerows during conversion to bioenergy production.",,,,"Stout, Jane C/B-1631-2010; Stanley, Dara/K-2295-2012","Stout, Jane C/0000-0002-2027-0863; Stanley, Dara/0000-0001-8948-8409",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,APR,2013,50,2,,,,,335,344,,10.1111/1365-2664.12060,,,,,,,WOS:000316969300007,,,,,

Under certain environmental conditions asexual reproduction is predominant, which generates ecological consequences on sexual fecundity. In this context, we studied the reproductive ecology of the creeping clonal cactus Echinopsis thelegona in La Bodega (Salta, Argentina), where low fruit and seed production was preliminarily observed. Specifically, we studied the flower availability, fruit and seed production, reproductive system, floral visitors and effects of neighbor ramets on reproductive success. The number of available flowers per day was low, and fruit production was low or null as well. Echinopsis thelegona is self-incompatible. Although its flowers have sphingophilous traits, we did not find evidence of moths visiting them. Only native and exotic bees visited the flowers of this species, though with a low number of visits. Therefore, nocturnal visitors were not registered as pollinators of E. thelegona, perhaps because of their low local abundances. On the other hand, bees behaved as inefficient pollinators of E. thelegona due to their foraging behavior, which moves pollen within individuals. A pollen-addition experiment revealed that there is no fruit production at short distances among ramets. Therefore, the combination of self-incompatibility, low flower production and low local abundance of pollinators could account for the low fruit production observed in this species. This finding suggests that populations of E. thelegona persist by clonality and that they tend toward the loss of sexuality.",,,,,"Gorostiague, Pablo/0000-0001-5131-5940",,,,,,,,,,,,0378-2697,1615-6110,,,,APR,2013,299,4,,,,,785,791,,10.1007/s00606-013-0761-6,,,,,,,WOS:000316262300008,,,,,

The aim of this study is to investigate how the characteristics of waggle dances for natural food sources and environmental factors affect dance follower behaviour. Because food source profitability tends to decrease with increasing foraging distance, we hypothesised that the attractiveness of a dance, measured as the number of dance followers and their attendance, decreases with increasing distance to the advertised food location. Additionally, we determined whether time of year and dance signal noise, quantified as the variation in waggle run direction and duration, affect dance follower behaviour. Our results suggest that bees follow fewer waggle runs as the food source distance increases, but that they invest more time in following each dance. This is because waggle run duration increases with increasing foraging distance. Followers responded to increased angular noise in dances indicating more distant food sources by following more waggle runs per dance than when angular noise was low. The number of dance followers per dancing bee was also affected by the time of year and varied among colonies. Our results provide evidence that both noise in the message, that is variation in the direction component, and the message itself, that is the distance of the advertised food location, affect dance following.

Loops that take bees away from and bring them back towards the nest are common during learning flights and less so in return flights. Zigzags are more prominent on return flights. Both motifs tend to be nest based. Bees often both fly towards and face the nest in the middle of loops and at the turns of zigzags. Before and after flight direction and body orientation are aligned, the two diverge from each other so that the nest is held within the bees 'fronto-lateral visual field while flight direction relative to the nest can fluctuate more widely.

They thus obtain similar views of the nest and its surroundings on their learning and return flights. How do bees coordinate their flights relative to nest-based and compass-based reference frames to get such similar views? We show, first, that learning and return flights contain straight segments that are directed along particular compass bearings, which are independent of the orientation of a bee's body. Bees are thus free within limits to adjust their viewing direction relative to the nest, without disturbing flight direction. Second, we examine the coordination of nest-based and compass-based control during likely information gathering segments of these flights: loops during learning flights and zigzags on return flights. We find that bees tend to start a loop or zigzag when flying within a restricted range of compass directions and to fly towards the nest and face it after a fixed change in compass direction, without continuous interactions between their nest-based and compass-based directions of flight. A preferred trajectory of compass-based flight over the course of a motif, combined with the tendency of the bees to keep their body oriented towards the nest automatically narrows the range of compass directions over which bees view the nest.

Pollen dispersal patterns may vary strongly, even between similar congeneric species, depending on the mating system, pollinator assemblages and floral traits. We investigated pollen dispersal and fruit production in a population of Vaccinium oxycoccos, an insect-pollinated shrub, and compared the pollen dispersal pattern with a co-flowering, sympatric congener, V.uliginosum. We examined whether they share pollinators (through interspecific fluorescent dye transfers) and may differently attract pollinators, by comparing their floral colour as perceived by insects. Fluorescent dyes were mainly dispersed over short distances (80% within 40.4m (max. 94.5m) for V.oxycoccos and 3.0m (max. 141.3m) for V.uliginosum). Dye dispersal in V.oxycoccos was not significantly affected by plant area, floral display or the proximity to V.uliginosum plants. Interspecific dye transfers were observed, indicating pollinator sharing. The significantly lower dye deposition on V.oxycoccos stigmas suggests lower visitation rates by pollinators, despite higher flower density and local abundance. The spectral reflectance analysis indicates that bees are unlikely to be able to discriminate between the two species based on floral colour alone. Fruit production increased with increasing floral display, but was not affected by proximity to V.uliginosum plants. Our study highlights that fragmented populations of V.oxycoccos, when sympatric with co-flowering V.uliginosum, might incur increased competition for the shared pollinators in the case of pollination disruption, which might then reduce outcrossed seed set.",,,,"Michez, Denis/L-1370-2019","Michez, Denis/0000-0001-8880-1838; Vereecken, Nicolas/0000-0002-8858-4623",,,,,,,,,,,,1435-8603,1438-8677,,,,MAR,2013,15,2,,,,,344,352,,10.1111/j.1438-8677.2012.00646.x,,,,,,,WOS:000314756900010,22823148,,,,

We report on an in-depth exploration of an iterative improvement heuristic model of bumblebee traplining previously found to accurately replicate the establishment of stable routes by bees between flowers distributed over several hectares. The critical test for a model is its predictive power for empirical data for which the model has not been specifically developed, and here the model is shown to be consistent with observations from different research groups made at several spatial scales and using multiple configurations of flowers. We refine the model to account for the spatial search strategy of bees exploring their environment, and test several previously unexplored predictions. We find that the model predicts accurately 1) the increasing propensity of bees to optimize their foraging routes with increasing spatial scale; 2) that bees cannot establish stable optimal traplines for all spatial configurations of rewarding flowers; 3) the observed trade-off between travel distance and prioritization of high-reward sites (with a slight modification of the model); 4) the temporal pattern with which bees acquire approximate solutions to travelling salesman-like problems over several dozen foraging bouts; 5) the instability of visitation schedules in some spatial configurations of flowers; 6) the observation that in some flower arrays, bees' visitation schedules are highly individually different; 7) the searching behaviour that leads to efficient location of flowers and routes between them.

We focused on the role of semi-natural habitats, oilseed rape (OSR) and other crops. Our originality was to consider not only the spatial heterogeneity of the crop field mosaic but also its temporal heterogeneity through the crop rotations. Solitary bees were caught with colored pan traps in 15 margins of OSR fields and 35 margins of non-OSR fields. We found that solitary bee abundance and species richness were higher in margins of OSR fields than in margins of non-OSR fields, showing that early spring-flying species widely use this mass flowering crop. However the high number of rare species in margins of non-OSR fields (21 species recorded exclusively in these margins) highlighted the importance of these margins for the conservation of solitary bee diversity. The influence of the landscape context on solitary bees showed contrasted results according to the type of margin and the spatial scale. At the finest spatial scale, abundance in margins of OSR fields increased with increasing proportion of non-flowering crops (cereals and temporary grasslands) in the current year. At large spatial scales, solitary bee abundance in margins of non-OSR fields was positively affected by the proportion of long-term grasslands. Moreover, the proportion of fields only sown with cereals during the last 5 years negatively affected abundance and species richness at the large scales whereas the proportion of mixed fields (at least 1 year of grassland in the rotation) had a positive effect on species richness. We showed that accounting for the cumulative effects of field cover and management through the crop rotations is relevant for studying solitary bee communities. The introduction of less intensive covers, such as temporary grasslands, in cereal rotations positively influences these communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Succession in plant communities, in addition to reforestation following the creation of open sites through harvesting or natural disturbances, can affect forest faunal assemblages. Wild bees perform an important ecosystem function in human-altered and natural or seminatural ecosystems, as they are essential pollinators for both crops and wild flowering plants. To maintain high abundance and species richness for pollination services, it is important to conserve and create seminatural and natural land cover with optimal successional stages for wild bees. We examined the effects of forest succession on wild bees. In particular, we evaluated the importance of early successional stages for bees, which has been suspected but not previously demonstrated. A range of successional stages, between 1 and 178 years old, were examined in naturally regenerated and planted forests. In total 4465 wild bee individuals, representing 113 species, were captured. Results for total bees, solitary bees, and cleptoparasitic bees in both naturally regenerated and planted conifer forests indicated a higher abundance and species richness in the early successional stages. However, higher abundance and species richness of social bees in naturally regenerated forest were observed as the successional stages progressed, whereas the abundance of social bees in conifer planted forest showed a concave-shaped relationship when plotted. The results suggest that early successional stages of both naturally regenerated and conifer planted forest maintain a high abundance and species richness of solitary bees and their cleptoparasitic bees, although social bees respond differently in the early successional stages. This may imply that, in some cases, active forest stand management policies, such as the clear-cutting of planted forests for timber production, would create early successional habitats, leading to significant positive effects for bees in general.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Feb-15,2013,8,2,,,,,,,e56678,10.1371/journal.pone.0056678,,,,,,,WOS:000315603700071,23457602,,,,

We present results of experiments testing the effects of nectar yeasts on foraging patterns of captive and free-ranging bumble bees, and also on pollination success and fecundity of the early-blooming, bumble bee-pollinated Helleborus foetidus (Ranunculaceae). Under controlled experimental conditions, inexperienced Bombus terrestris workers responded positively to the presence of yeasts in artificial sugar solutions mimicking floral nectar by visiting proportionally more yeast-containing artificial flowers. Free-ranging bumble bees also preferred yeast-containing nectar in the field. Experiments conducted in two different years consistently showed that natural and artificial nectars containing yeasts were more thoroughly removed than nectars without yeasts. Experimental yeast inoculation of the nectar of H. foetidus flowers was significantly associated with reductions in number of pollen tubes in the style, fruit set, seed set, and mass of individual seeds produced.

Within-colony comparisons between subfamilies of workers (patrilines or matrilines) revealed genetic effects on division of labor in many social insect species. Although this has been taken as evidence for additive genetic effects on division of labor, it has never been experimentally tested. To determine the relative roles of additive and nonadditive genetic effects (e.g., genetic compatibility, epistasis, and parent-of-origin imprinting effects) on worker behavior, we performed controlled crosses using the Argentine ant Linepithema humile. Three of the measured behaviors (the efficiency to collect pupae, the foraging propensity, and the distance between non-brood-tenders and brood) were affected by the maternal genetic background and the two others (the efficiency to feed larvae and the distance between brood-tenders and brood) by the paternal genetic background. Moreover, there were significant interactions between the maternal and paternal genetic backgrounds for three of the five behaviors. These results are most consistent with parent-of-origin and genetic compatibility effects on division of labor.

The death of bees has been correlated with the use of neonicotinoid-coated seed and the toxic particulates emitted by pneumatic drilling machines. The contamination of foragers in flight over the ploughed fields has been hypothesized. The airborne contamination has been proven, both with bees inside fixed cages around the field and in free flight near the driller. A new trial involving mobile cages has been established and consists of making rapid passes with single bees inside cages fixed to an aluminium bar. The bar was moved by two operators at different distances from the working drilling machine. A single pass was shown as sufficient to kill all the bees exposed to exhaust air on the emission side of the drill, when bees were subsequently held in high relative humidity. The extent of toxic cloud around driller was evaluated at the height of 0.5, 1.8 and 3.5 m and proved to be about 20 m in diameter, with an ellipsoidal shape. The shape may be influenced by working speed of the drill and environmental parameters, and is easily shown by adding talc powder to the seed in the machine hopper. A new driller equipment was evaluated consisting of two tubes inclined towards the soil that direct the exhaust air towards the ground. The survival rate of the bees was not substantially increased using the modified drill and was lower than 50%. Chemical analyses show up to 4000 ng of insecticide in single bees with an average content around 300 ng. Similar quantities were observed at increased distances from the modified or unmodified drillers. This new evaluation of bee mortality in the field is an innovative biological test to verify the hypothetical efficiency (or not) of driller modifications.",,,,"Giorio, Chiara/O-1707-2015; Tapparo, Andrea/I-3913-2012","Giorio, Chiara/0000-0001-7821-7398; Tapparo, Andrea/0000-0001-8928-705X; Mazzon, Luca/0000-0002-8459-893X",,,,,,,,,,,,0931-2048,1439-0418,,,,FEB,2013,137,1-Feb,,,,,35,44,,10.1111/j.1439-0418.2012.01718.x,,,,,,,WOS:000313517400004,,,,,

The presence of co-flowering invasives has also been shown to affect some native plants through the reduction in pollinator visitation or through the deposition of heterospecific pollen on the native's stigmas leading to stigma clogging. We examined the impact of the invasive plant Solanum elaeagnifolium Cavanilles (silver-leafed nightshade), native to South and Central America and South-western parts of North America, on the seed set of the native Glaucium flavum Crantz (yellow-horned poppy) on Lesvos Island, Greece. To do this we measured seed set and visitation rates to G. flavum before and after the placement of potted individuals of the invasive near the native plants. In addition, we hand-crossed G. flavum flowers with super-optimal amounts of conspecific pollen, bagged flowers to measure the rate of spontaneous selfing, and applied self-pollen to measure self-compatibility of G. flavum. The hand-selfing treatment resulted in very low seed set, which indicates that G. flavum is to a large degree self-incompatible and highlights the plant's need for insect-mediated outcrossing. We show that the presence of the invasive significantly enhanced pollen limitation, although the overall visitation rates were not reduced and that this increase is due to a reduction in honeybee visitation in the presence of the invasive resulting in reduced pollination.",,,,"Petanidou, Theodora/C-9399-2011; Tscheulin, T./B-9722-2011","Petanidou, Theodora/0000-0003-1883-0945; Tscheulin, T./0000-0002-9901-1521",,,,,,,,,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,FEB,2013,15,2,,,,,385,393,,10.1007/s10530-012-0293-y,,,,,,,WOS:000313030500014,,,,,

It is thought that there may be a temperature barrier to its infiltration into countries in colder climates. In this study, 71 colonies from Scottish Beekeeper's Association members have been screened for the presence of N. apis and N. ceranae across Scotland. We find that only 11 of the 71 colonies tested positive for spores by microscopy. However, 70.4 % of colonies screened by PCR revealed the presence of both N. ceranae and N. apis, with only 4.2 or 7 % having either strain alone and 18.3 % being Nosema free. A range of geographically separated colonies testing positive for N. ceranae were sequenced to confirm their identity. All nine sequences confirmed the presence of N. ceranae and indicated the presence of a single new variant. Furthermore, two of the spore-containing colonies had only N. ceranae present, and these exhibited the presence of smaller spores that could be distinguished from N. apis by the analysis of average spore size. Differential quantification of the PCR product revealed N. ceranae to be the dominant species in all seven samples tested.

Using a population genetics approach, we determine the impact of habitat and floral resource distributions on nesting and foraging patterns of a critical native pollinator, Bombus vosnesenskii. Our findings demonstrate that native bee foraging is far more plastic and extensive than previously believed and does not follow a simple optimal foraging strategy. Rather, bumble bees forage further in pursuit of species-rich floral patches and in landscapes where patch-to-patch variation in floral resources is less, regardless of habitat composition. Thus, our results reveal extreme foraging plasticity and demonstrate that floral diversity, not density, drives bee foraging distance. Furthermore, we find a negative impact of paved habitat and a positive impact of natural woodland on bumble bee nesting densities.

The fractal and superdiffusive properties of Levy walks can be advantageous when searching for randomly and sparsely distributed resources, prompting the suggestion that Levy walks represent an evolutionary optimal searching strategy. The suggestion is supported by a plethora of empirical studies which have revealed that many organisms (a diverse range of marine predator, honeybees, Escherichia coli) have movement patterns that can approximated by Levy walks. Nonetheless, Levy walks with their strange fractal geometry appear alien to biology and their relevance to biology has been hotly debated. Here I describe some of my own recent contributions to Levy walk research. This research has sought to identify biologically plausible mechanisms by which organisms can execute Levy walks and to demonstrate that these movement patterns have a utility beyond the understanding and prediction of optimal searching patterns.

The prevalence of A. bombi and N. bombi was too low to analyse. The prevalence and abundance of Crithidia spp. was significantly different among bumble bee species. Overall, the prevalence of Crithidia spp. was initially lower on farms deploying commercial bumble bees, possibly due to a dilution effect caused by the high density of imported bees. Crithidia spp. prevalence in Bombus terrestris, however, rose sharply on commercial farms at the end of the season. One potential explanation is that commercial bumble bees contract the local pathogen, which is then rapidly transmitted among them due to the high bee density. Whilst our data provide no evidence of pathogen spillover to wild species, it would be premature to conclude with certainty that commercial colonies do not represent a disease risk to native bees in the UK and we urge further studies into this phenomenon.",,,,"Tinsley, Matthew/S-9707-2018; Goulson, David/A-2462-2010","Tinsley, Matthew/0000-0002-7715-1259; Goulson, David/0000-0003-4421-2876; Whitehorn, Penelope/0000-0001-9852-1012",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8839,2078-6913,,,,,2013,52,3,,,,,149,157,,10.3896/IBRA.1.52.3.06,,,,,,,WOS:000322418500006,,,,,

With the present experiments we attempt to interfere with both, stride integration and optic flow input in order to reveal possible interactions of the two modes of odometry and further functional details of the stride integrator. We tried to impair stride integration by amputating two of the six walking legs. Amputation of left middle and right hind legs had especially severe effects since it left only the right front leg in one of the support tripods that are alternately used in walking. We tried to impair optic flow input - which is used for distance estimation to a minor extent - by covering both ventral eye halves. These two sets of manipulations were carried out in combination to study possible compensatory effects, for instance, of optic flow input in the case of an impaired stride integrator. Unexpectedly, none of the manipulations we carried out had significant effects on homing performance. This was true with regard to homing distance estimation (as determined by the centres of the ants' nest searches) and homing certainty (as determined by the search spreads). These results corroborate the surprising robustness of odometly by stride integration, and they indicate that leg proprioceptive feedback is used for stride integration. The question of a possible interaction of optic flow input and stride integration remains open. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, species' responses to land-use change may differ depending on their life history traits such as dispersal ability, trophic level, or sociality. We assessed species richness and life history traits of wild bees in 32 calcareous grasslands in central Germany that differ in size, connectivity, resource availability and landscape context. Declining habitat area and, to a lesser degree, reduced diversity of the surrounding landscape were the key factors negatively influencing species richness. In the community-wide analysis, small body size and solitary reproduction were traits that made species particularly vulnerable to habitat loss. Contrary to our expectations, cleptoparasitic species were not more affected by reduced habitat area and landscape diversity than nest-building species. We performed further detailed trait analyses within the family Halictidae to prevent possible confounding effects due to trait correlations across families. Here, social as opposed to solitary species were more affected by habitat loss. We conclude that the opposite pattern observed for all social bees was mainly caused by large-sized social bumblebee species with high mobility and large foraging distances. Our results demonstrate the risks of concealed trait interference when analyzing community-wide patterns of life history traits.

Using five genes, we inferred the phylogeny of Hoplitis including 23 out of the 27 currently recognized subgenera, applying both Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. Compared to the current morphology-based classification, our phylogeny resulted in three classificatory changes: first, the subgenera Alcidamea, Cyrtosmia, Dasyosmia, Megalosmia, Monumetha, and Prionohoplitis are merged into one large subgenus Alcidamea Cresson, 1864, comb. nov.; second, the subgenera Annosmia, Bytinskia, Coloplitis, and Hoplitis are merged into one large subgenus Hoplitis Klug, 1807, comb. nov.; third, the subgenera Acrosmia, Hoplitina, Penteriades, and Proteriades are merged into one large subgenus Proteriades Titus, 1904, comb. nov. We provide evidence that the genus Hoplitis has a Palaearctic origin and that colonization events to southern Africa and to the Nearctic, as well as recolonization events from the Nearctic to the Palaearctic occurred. The species of the genus Hoplitis exhibit an extraordinary diversity in nesting behaviour, comprising both below and above ground nesting. Parsimony mapping revealed that ground nesting in excavated burrows is the ancestral state amongst Hoplitis bees.

Behavioral alterations under speed-accuracy trade-offs,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Trapline foraging (repeated sequential visits to a series of feeding locations) has often been observed in animals collecting floral resources. Past experiments have shown that bumble bees cannot always develop accurate (i.e., repeatable) traplines to a sufficient level, despite their economic advantages in many situations. The bees' preference for short flights works against developing accurate traplines when plants or patches are distributed in zigzag fashion. How should bees cope with such situations in nature? We conducted laboratory experiments with artificial flowers to test 2 nonexclusive hypotheses: bees may travel faster to compensate for low traplining accuracy, and when local landmarks are available, bees may be able to develop traplines by remembering external spatial information in addition to the locations of flowers. As predicted, foragers on a zigzag-shaped floral array traveled faster, with lower route repeatability, than those on a triangular lattice where distance and angle could be chosen independently, suggesting that bees trade-off accuracy for speed when it is more feasible. In contrast, bees traveled more slowly with unchanged traplining accuracy when landmarks were added into both arrays, possibly because the landmarks caused information load or visual distraction. Finally, bees on the zigzag array with additional landmarks made a quicker decision to switch from accurate traplining to fast traveling. If landmarks helped the bees to grasp the overall array geometry in our experiments, they may also permit bees in nature to select a distribution of plants or patches that aids accurate traplining.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045-2249,,,,,JAN-FEB,2013,24,1,,,,,182,189,,10.1093/beheco/ars152,,,,,,,WOS:000312431000026,,,,,

Bumblebee foragers show diurnal rhythms under daily light: dark cycles and short-period free-running circadian rhythms in constant light conditions in the laboratory. In contrast, during the continuous light conditions of the arctic summer, they show robust 24-h rhythms in their foraging patterns, meaning that some external zeitgeber must entrain their circadian clocks in the presence of constant light. Although the sun stays above the horizon for weeks during the arctic summer, the light quality, especially in the ultraviolet (UV) range, exhibits pronounced daily changes. Since the photoreceptors and photopigments that synchronize the circadian system of bees are not known, we tested if the circadian clocks of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) can be entrained by daily cycles in UV light levels. Bumblebee colonies were set up in the laboratory and exposed to 12 h: 12 h UV + : UV- cycles in otherwise continuous lighting conditions by placing UV filters on their foraging arenas for 12 h each day. The activity patterns of individual bees were recorded using fully automatic radiofrequency identification (RFID). We found that colonies manipulated in such a way showed synchronized 24-h rhythms, whereas simultaneously tested control colonies with no variation in UV light levels showed free-running rhythms instead. The results of our study show that bumblebee circadian rhythms can indeed be synchronized by daily cycles in ambient light spectral composition.

Habitat fragmentation is thought to threaten biodiversity, but the response of pollinators to fragmentation is still poorly understood, and research seldom includes pollinator nesting requirements. 2. We investigated pollinator community composition in a highly fragmented oak-savannah ecosystem in south-western British Columbia, Canada. We sampled pollinators in 19 fragments ranging from 0.3 to 31 ha and surrounded by a variety of land-use types, including forest, low-density suburban, and urban neighbourhoods. Pan-trapping and netting surveys captured 4464 bees, flies, and wasps in 138 species and 48 genera. 3. Contrary to expectations, overall species richness did not increase with fragment size. However, ground-nester abundance (not diversity) and cavity-nester diversity (not abundance) were higher in larger fragments, as expected. Floral richness and abundance did not foster pollinator diversity for either guild. Brood parasite responses were complex: host availability (ground-nesting bees) was generally important, richness and abundance increased in fragments with high surrounding road density, and abundance also increased in fragments with other habitat fragments nearby. 4. Responses of different nesting guilds to fragmentation may be related to their use of the landscape surrounding habitat fragments. Some common cavity nesters can nest in fences and gardens, but urban land use may be less hospitable for ground nesters. Brood parasites apparently respond both to host availability and landscape characteristics associated with movement among fragments. 5. Consideration of nesting requirements of pollinators provided some insight into their response to habitat loss in our analysis and should be considered in future studies of fragmentation impacts on pollinator biodiversity.",,,,,"Griswold, Terry/0000-0003-3952-9393",,,,,,,,,,,,1752-458X,1752-4598,,,,JAN,2013,6,1,,,,,57,66,,10.1111/j.1752-4598.2012.00187.x,,,,,,,WOS:000313880200007,,,,,

These methods will be explained in detail in different sections. Honey bees are model organisms in behavioural biology for their complex yet plastic division of labour. To observe the daily behaviour of individual bees in a colony, classical observation hives are very useful. The setting up and use of typical observation hives will be the focus of another section.

Insects can provide comparable nutritional yields to meat on a gram-for-gram basis and may serve as an important source of energy, fat, protein, minerals, and vitamins for hominoids. Although potential insect prey are abundant in ape habitats, patterns of insectivory are not consistent across species or populations. Efforts to understand these patterns are complicated by a lack of nutritional data. We collected samples of insects consumed by the Kasekela chimpanzee community of Gombe National Park, Tanzania, as well as of some insects found within the community range and ignored by these chimpanzees but known to be preyed upon by Pan elsewhere. We determined the gross energy (GE), estimated metabolizable energy (ME), fat, protein, fiber, and ash content of these samples following standard methodologies. We use these data to test the hypothesis that Kasekela chimpanzees choose insect prey (at least in part) based on energy and/or macronutrient content. On a fresh-weight, per-gram basis, the insect prey consumed by Kasekela chimpanzees had significantly higher fat and lower ash content than other assayed insects, and on a fresh-weight, per-foraging-unit (per-insect, per-dip, or per-nest) basis were significantly higher in GE, fat, and protein. On a per-gram basis, the assayed insects were generally comparable in energy and macronutrients to wild vertebrate meat. We conclude that Kasekela chimpanzees do favor insects that are high in energy, fat, and protein, and that the potential macronutrient yields from some forms of insectivory are not trivial.

The main focus will be on the third algorithm, namely STIGMERGIC LANDMARK FORAGING which is a novel hybrid approach. It combines the high performance of bee-inspired navigation with ant-inspired recruitment. More precisely, navigation is based on Path Integration which results in vectors indicating the distance and direction to a destination. Recruitment only occurs at key locations (i.e., landmarks) inside of the environment. Each landmark contains a collection of vectors with which visiting agents can find their way to a certain goal or to another landmark in an unknown environment. Each vector represents a local segment of a global route. In contrast to ant-inspired recruitment, no attracting or repelling pheromone is used to indicate where to go and how worthwhile a route is in comparison to other routes. Instead, each vector in a landmark has a certain strength indicating how worthwhile it is. In analogy to ant-inspired recruitment, vector strength can be reinforced by visiting agents. Moreover, vector strength decays over time. In the end, this results in optimal routes to destinations.

Therefore, samples of returning bees were collected in front of the entrance early in the morning as well as during the day in summer and autumn 2010. In the laboratory, honey sacs of bees without pollen or propolis were examined. Honey sac samples with a weight of >= 0.005 g were classified as successful foragers. For the determination of water or nectar foragers, the honey sac contents of successful foragers were analyzed with a refractometer. Due to the dilution and the precision of the refractometer, an accuracy of 5 % was possible. Based on the known range of sugar concentrations in nectars, the analyzed samples were divided into nectar foragers (25-65 % sugar) and water foragers (0-15 % sugar). The study reveals that nectar and water foraging bees can be discriminated by analyzing the honey sac extracts with a refractometer.

To date, the impact of plant population size on pollen collection by pollinators has not yet been investigated. From 2008 to 2010, we monitored nine bumble bee species (Bombus campestris, Bombus hortorum s.l., Bombus hypnorum, Bombus lapidarius, Bombus pascuorum, Bombus pratorum, Bombus soroensis, Bombus terrestris s.l., Bombus vestalis s.l.) on Vaccinium uliginosum (Ericaceae) in up to nine populations in Belgium ranging in size from 80 m 2 to over 3.1 ha. Bumble bee abundance declined with decreasing plant population size, and especially the proportion of individuals of large bumble bee species diminished in smaller populations. The most remarkable and novel observation was that bumble bees seemed to switch foraging behaviour according to population size: while they collected both pollen and nectar in large populations, they largely neglected pollen collection in small populations. This pattern was due to large bumble bee species, which seem thus to be more likely to suffer from pollen shortages in smaller habitat fragments. Comparing pollen loads of bumble bees we found that fidelity to V. uliginosum pollen did not depend on plant population size but rather on the extent shrub cover and/or openness of the site. Bumble bees collected pollen only from three plant species (V. uliginosum, Sorbus aucuparia and Cytisus scoparius). We also did not discover any pollination limitation of V. uliginosum in small populations. We conclude that habitat fragmentation might not immediately threaten the pollination of V. uliginosum, nevertheless, it provides important nectar and pollen resources for bumble bees and declining populations of this plant could have negative effects for its pollinators. The finding that large bumble bee species abandon pollen collection when plant populations become small is of interest when considering plant and bumble bee conservation.",,,,"Michez, Denis/L-1370-2019","Michez, Denis/0000-0001-8880-1838",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Nov-27,2012,7,11,,,,,,,e50353,10.1371/journal.pone.0050353,,,,,,,WOS:000311885800067,23209721,,,,

As such, the daily in-and-out activity of a beehive could be automatically recorded with minimum interference with the regular behavior of the bees. The components of the imaging system include: (1) an infrared LED light source; (2) an infrared CCD camera and a personal computer for image acquisition and processing; and (3) an acrylic passageway to temporarily confine the bees within the image-capturing range of the camera. In operation, this imaging system was affixed to the outside of a beehive at the entry/exit point. To identify each forager of bee workers individually, circular character-encoding tags were attached to the dorsum of the bees' thoraxes. To locate individual honey bees in a video frame, a circular Hough transform was used to detect the presence of the circular tags. A black positioning dot on the tag was used to identify the orientation of the characters in order to facilitate the reading of the symbols on the circular tag. The extracted character symbols were further segmented and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was deployed to recognize the characters and identify the individual honey bee. The system developed in this study was used in experimentation to identify each of the tagged bees and to record the timing of the entries and exits. The character symbol recognition and identification accuracy rates of the system were about 98% and 86%, respectively. Based on the in-and-out records, daily foraging behavior of honey bees were analyzed and presented. These experimental results demonstrate that this imaging system is feasible and can be used as an efficient tool to study honey bee behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Their zygomorphic flowers have been the object of numerous studies in morphology, ecology, and developmental genetics, and new phylogenetic insights make it timely to synthesize knowledge about their evolution. Key features of Delphinieae flowers are unusual nectaries consisting of paired organs of the inner perianth whorl that are completely enclosed by a single dorsal organ of the outer whorl. We investigated the floral development of five annual, unicarpellate species of Delphinium, focusing on perianth organization. The results show that the nectar-storing organ in these species results from the postgenital fusion of two primordia of the internal perianth whorl. Eleven floral traits traced on a phylogeny of Delphinieae reveal only two homoplasies in the perianth, namely, the nightcap shape of the dorsal organ of the external perianth whorl and the reduction of the internal perianth whorl to two organs, traits that each evolved once in Aconitum and once in Delphinium. The length of the inner spur(s), the type of pollinator (bees, hummingbirds, hawkmoths), and species altitudinal ranges are unrelated, but most species are exclusively bumblebee adapted, and bee tongue lengths may match the internal nectar spur lengths. The paired inner spurs present in most Delphinieae require a back-and-forth movement of the tongue while the pollinator is inside the flower or hovering close to it. A new evolutionary scenario reconciles the diversity of perianth organization in Delphinieae with the tribe's conserved pollination mechanism.",,,,,"Jabbour, Florian/0000-0002-7729-1067",,,,,,,,,,,,1058-5893,,,,,NOV-DEC,2012,173,9,,,,,1036,1054,,10.1086/667613,,,,,,,WOS:000310573700008,,,,,

Whether foraging honeybees can make similarly complex navigational decisions from locations away from the hive is unknown. To examine whether or not such secondary decision-making hubs exist, we trained bees to forage at four different locations. Specifically, we trained honeybees to first forage to a distal site ""CT"" 100 m away from the hive; if food was present, they fed and then chose to go home. If food was not present, the honeybees were trained to forage to three auxiliary sites, each at a different time of the day: A in the morning, B at noon, and C in the afternoon. The foragers learned to check site CT for food first and then efficiently depart to the correct location based upon the time of day if there was no food at site CT. Thus, the honeybees were able to cognitively map motivation, time, and five different locations (Hive, CT, A, B, and C) in two spatial dimensions; these are the contents of the cognitive map used by the honeybees here. While at site CT, we verified that the honeybees could choose between 4 different directions (to A, B, C, and the Hive) and thus label it as a secondary decision-making hub. The observed decision making uncovered here is inferred to constitute genuine logical operations, involving a branched structure, based upon the premises of motivational state, and spatiotemporal knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1435-9448,1435-9456,,,,NOV,2012,15,6,,,,,1195,1203,,10.1007/s10071-012-0544-4,,,,,,,WOS:000310167000015,22864869,,,,

This significantly decreased in the last 0.5 h until only one or two dance directions were being advertised. All colonies reached a near consensus in the last 20 dances before liftoff. The swarm flight path is meandering so the actual distance flown is about twice that indicated by the dances. During the last 3 min the waggle dance in most colonies showed nest target angles that were closely clustered indicating that the final directions advertised were close to the chosen target site.

Temporal variation in floral resources may influence the population dynamics of pollinators. We investigated the relationship between the population dynamics of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) and canopy floral resources over 5 years in a cool temperate forest. We predicted that the yearly fluctuation of canopy resources affects colony development and queen production, resulting in the variation of the pollination success of understorey plants the following spring. Flower production of canopy trees showed clear biyearly fluctuations, synchronously among most species. Worker production of Bombus ardens and Bombus hypocrita were positively related to floral resources during colony establishment by overwintered queens, while that of Bombus diversus was positively related to floral resources during the worker-active period. An abundance of overwintered queens was positively related to both worker abundance and floral resources in the previous summer in B. ardens and to only previous-year worker abundance in B. hypocrita but was dependent on neither factor in B. diversus. These differences in causal effects on queen production among species might be a reflection of interspecific differences in the degree of dependence on canopy resources for queen production due to species-specific phenologies and/or foraging preferences of other species of flowers. The extent of pollen limitation in the spring-ephemeral Corydalis ambigua, which is exclusively pollinated by overwintered queens, was negatively correlated with the abundance of B. hypocrita queens. Thus, population dynamics of bumble bees has a crucial effect on seed production of understorey plants. Synthesis. The dynamics of flower production in overstory trees can indirectly affect the pollination efficiency of understorey plants in the next season via the population dynamics of pollinators.

Results of these studies range from strong to nil effect among the variety of species, fitness measurements and damage modes studied, suggesting that not all damage modes are equal and that insects may be well adapted to compensate for some types of damage. Here, we examine the biomechanical and neuromuscular means by which flying insects compensate for asymmetric wing damage, which is expected to produce asymmetric flight forces and torques and thus destabilize the animal in addition to reducing its total wing size. We measured the kinematic and neuromuscular responses of hawkmoths (Manduca sexta) hovering in free flight with asymmetrically damaged wings via high-speed videography and extracellular neuromuscular activity recordings. The animals responded to asymmetric wing damage with asymmetric changes to wing stroke amplitude sufficient to restore symmetry in lift production. These asymmetries in stroke amplitude were significantly correlated with bilateral asymmetries in the timing of activation of the dorsal ventral muscle among and within trials. Correspondingly, the magnitude of wing asymmetry was significantly, although non-linearly, correlated with the magnitude of the neuromuscular response among individuals. The strongly non-linear nature of the relationship suggests that active neural compensation for asymmetric wing damage may only be necessary above a threshold (>12% asymmetry in wing second moment of area in this case) below which passive mechanisms may be adequate to maintain flight stability.",,,,"Fernandez, Maria Jose/I-6087-2012","Hedrick, Tyson/0000-0002-6573-9602",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,OCT,2012,215,20,,,,,3631,3638,,10.1242/jeb.073627,,,,,,,WOS:000309543600019,22771747,,,,

Focal exploration comes first- the departing bee turns around to face the return target and oscillates in a lateral flight pattern of increasing amplitude and distance. Thereafter, for the peripheral exploration, the forward flying bee circles the return-goal area with expanding and alternating clockwise and counterclockwise arcs. After this two-part proximal exploration follows distal exploration, the bee flies straight towards her potential distal goal. For the return path, supported by the preceding exploratory learning, the return navigational performance is expected to reflect the three exploratory parts in reverse order. Previously only two performance parts have been experimentally identified: focal navigation and distal navigation. Here we discovered peripheral navigation as being distinct from focal and distal navigation. Like focal navigation, yet unlike distal navigation, peripheral navigation is invariably triggered by local place recognition. Whereas focal navigation (orientation) is close to unidirectional, peripheral navigation makes use of multiple goal-vector knowledge. We term the area in question the Peripheral Correction Area because within it peripheral navigation is triggered, which in turn is capable of correcting errors that accumulated during a preceding distal dead-reckoning based flight.

Native bees responded with changes in abundance, richness, diversity, and community composition. Responses varied with taxa and time of season. Bumble bees were sensitive to grazing intensity early in the season, showing reduced abundance, diversity, and/or richness with increased intensity, potentially because of altered foraging behavior.

One conspicuous threat to bumble bees is their unintended exposure to trace residues of systemic neonicotinoid pesticides, such as imidacloprid, which are ingested when bees forage on the nectar and pollen of treated crops. However, the demographic consequences for bumble bees of exposure to dietary neonicotinoids have yet to be fully established. To determine whether environmentally realistic levels of imidacloprid are capable of making a demographic impact on bumble bees, we exposed queenless microcolonies of worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, to a range of dosages of dietary imidacloprid between zero and 125 mu g L-1 and examined the effects on ovary development and fecundity. Microcolonies showed a dose-dependent decline in fecundity, with environmentally realistic dosages in the range of 1 mu g L-1 capable of reducing brood production by one third. In contrast, ovary development was unimpaired by dietary imidacloprid except at the highest dosage. Imidacloprid reduced feeding on both syrup and pollen but, after controlling statistically for dosage, microcolonies that consumed more syrup and pollen produced more brood. We therefore speculate that the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on fecundity emerge principally from nutrient limitation imposed by the failure of individuals to feed. Our findings raise concern about the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations.

To date, most research on green roofs has focused on minimizing environmental impacts of buildings and little is known about the ecological services they may provide. Previous research has found a deficiency of pollinating bees on green roofs, which could result in pollen limitation, poor seed production and reproductive failure of many plant species requiring bee pollination. This study aims to determine whether pollination services on modern green roofs are sufficient for these novel habitats to function sustainably. Nine native Illinois prairie plant species and their pollinator communities were studied on green roofs and ground-level locations in the Chicago area. Pan traps were used to assess pollinator communities and supplemental pollination treatments were used to evaluate pollen limitation. All species showed significantly reduced seed set when pollinators were excluded but few significant differences were observed between supplemental and open pollination treatments. Seed set differed by habitat type in that green roofs had a higher overall mean percent maximum seed set compared to ground-level sites. Our results support previous studies, showing lower numbers and diversity of bees on green roofs compared to the ground level. Together, these data suggest that although green roofs contain a smaller and less diverse community of pollinators, the insects that are present provide sufficient pollinator services for many native plants. This study therefore supports the use of biotically pollinated native forbs in future green roof design. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, flowering plants in Australia are likely to have independently evolved spectral signals that maximize colour discrimination by hymenoptera. Moreover, we found that the degree of variability in flower coloration for particular angiosperm species matched the range of reflectance colours that can only be discriminated by bees that have experienced differential conditioning. This observation suggests a requirement for plasticity in the nervous systems of pollinators to allow generalization of flowers of the same species while overcoming the possible presence of non-rewarding flower mimics.",,,,"Rosa, Marcello G/D-9278-2013","Rosa, Marcello G/0000-0002-6620-6285",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,,,,,Sep-07,2012,279,1742,,,,,3606,3615,,10.1098/rspb.2012.0827,,,,,,,WOS:000306832100030,22673351,,,,

The use of vision-based odometry has been studied extensively in horizontal distance measurement, but not vertical distance measurement. The honey bee Apis mellifera and the stingless bee Melipona seminigra measure distance visually using optic flow-movement of images as they pass across the retina. The honey bees gauge height using image motion in the ventral visual field. The stingless bees forage at different tropical forest canopy levels, ranging up to 40 m at our site. Thus, estimating height would be advantageous. We provide the first evidence that the stingless bee Melipona panamica utilizes optic flow information to gauge not only distance traveled but also height above ground, by processing information primarily from the lateral visual field. After training bees to forage at a set height in a vertical tunnel lined with black and white stripes, we observed foragers that explored a new tunnel with no feeder. In a new tunnel, bees searched at the same height they were trained to. In a narrower tunnel, bees experienced more image motion and significantly lowered their search height. In a wider tunnel, bees experienced less image motion and searched at significantly greater heights. In a tunnel without optic cues, bees were disoriented and searched at random heights. A horizontal tunnel testing these variables similarly affected foraging, but bees exhibited less precision (greater variance in search positions). Accurately gauging flight height above ground may be crucial for this species and others that compete for resources located at heights ranging from ground level to the high tropical forest canopies.",,,,"Nieh, James/H-8705-2014","Nieh, James/0000-0001-6237-0726",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,SEP,2012,215,18,,,,,3155,3160,,10.1242/jeb.070540,,,,,,,WOS:000308041400008,22915710,,,,

This study examined the visitation rates and foraging patterns of eight taxonomic groups of bees that are common to California poppies, Eschscholzia californica, in both landscape types. Bee occurrence was documented in relation to floral resource characteristics (patch area, poppy coverage, and poppy density), local landscape characteristics (distance to the wildland-urban interface, distance to riparian areas, distance to green space, and land use), and regional landscape context (urban versus wildland). Similar abundance and richness measures were recorded at both urban and wildland poppy patches, but community composition varied in each landscape. Bumble bees were more abundant at poppies in the wildland whereas species in the family Halictidae (sweat bees) were more abundant at poppies within the urban landscape. Resource patch size and density consistently correlated with increased bee presence for all bee types foraging in the wildland. Individual patterns of occurrence in the urban landscape were somewhat divergent; the foraging dynamics of larger bodied-bees (Bombus vosnesenskii and Megachile species) correlated significantly with resource patch size and density, whereas smaller-bodied bees (family Halictidae and Andrena species) were influenced by landscape characteristics such as distance to the wildland-urban interface and distance to riparian areas. In summary, the surrounding landscape had an influence on community composition, but the magnitude of the floral resource present at a site and factors relating to foraging energetics were dominant drivers of local occurrence. These results suggest that management strategies that provide dense and abundant floral resources should be successful in attracting bees, irrespective of their location within the urban matrix.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-8155,,,,,SEP,2012,15,3,,,,,581,598,,10.1007/s11252-011-0211-6,,,,,,,WOS:000307722300005,,,,,

To assess how pollinators respond to spatial heterogeneity of plant distributions and whether honeybees affect visitation by other pollinators we used an extensive data set comprising ten plant species and their flower visitors from five European countries. In particular we tested the hypothesis that the composition of the flower visitor community in terms of visitation frequencies by different pollinator groups were affected by the spatial plant population structure, viz. area and density measures, at a within-population ('patch') and among-population ('population') scale. We found that patch area and population density were the spatial variables that best explained the variation in visitation frequencies within the pollinator community. Honeybees had higher visitation frequencies in larger patches, while bumblebees and hoverflies had higher visitation frequencies in sparser populations. Solitary bees had higher visitation frequencies in sparser populations and smaller patches. We also tested the hypothesis that honeybees affect the composition of the pollinator community by altering the visitation frequencies of other groups of pollinators. There was a positive relationship between visitation frequencies of honeybees and bumblebees, while the relationship with hoverflies and solitary bees varied (positive, negative and no relationship) depending on the plant species under study. The overall conclusion is that the spatial structure of plant populations affects different groups of pollinators in contrasting ways at both the local ('patch') and the larger ('population') scales and, that honeybees affect the flower visitation by other pollinator groups in various ways, depending on the plant species under study.

Despite being taxonomically widespread, these routing behaviours remain poorly understood due to the difficulty of tracking the foraging history of animals in the wild. Here we examine how bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) develop and optimise traplines over large spatial scales by setting up an array of five artificial flowers arranged in a regular pentagon (50 m side length) and fitted with motion-sensitive video cameras to determine the sequence of visitation. Stable traplines that linked together all the flowers in an optimal sequence were typically established after a bee made 26 foraging bouts, during which time only about 20 of the 120 possible routes were tried. Radar tracking of selected flights revealed a dramatic decrease by 80% (ca. 1500 m) of the total travel distance between the first and the last foraging bout. When a flower was removed and replaced by a more distant one, bees engaged in localised search flights, a strategy that can facilitate the discovery of a new flower and its integration into a novel optimal trapline. Based on these observations, we developed and tested an iterative improvement heuristic to capture how bees could learn and refine their routes each time a shorter route is found.

One communication system where these alternatives are debated is the honeybee (Apis mellifera) waggle dance. Successful foragers communicate resource locations to nest-mates by a dance comprising repeated units (waggle runs), which repetitively transmit the same distance and direction vector from the nest. Intra-dance waggle run variation occurs and has been hypothesized as a colony-level adaptation to direct recruits over an area rather than a single location. Alternatively, variation may simply be due to constraints on bees' abilities to orient waggle runs. Here, we ask whether the angle at which the bee dances on vertical comb influences waggle run variation. In particular, we determine whether horizontal dances, where gravity is not aligned with the waggle run orientation, are more variable in their directional component. We analysed 198 dances from foragers visiting natural resources and found support for our prediction. More horizontal dances have greater angular variation than dances performed close to vertical. However, there is no effect of waggle run angle on variation in the duration of waggle runs, which communicates distance.

Forager bees that are typically older than 3 weeks of age show strong behavioral and molecular circadian rhythms with higher activity during the day. Younger bees that typically care for (""nurse"") the brood are active around the clock with similar brain clock gene levels throughout the day. However, nurses that are caged on brood-less combs inside or outside the hive show robust circadian rhythms with higher activity during the day, suggesting that direct contact with the brood mediates the plasticity in the circadian system. The nature of the brood signals affecting the workers' circadian system and the modalities by which they are detected are unknown. Given that the antennae are pivotal sensory organs in bees, we hypothesized that they are involved in mediating the brood influence on the plasticity in circadian rhythms. The flagella of the antennae are densely covered with diverse sensory structures able to detect a wide range of signals. To test our hypothesis, we removed the flagella of nurses and observed their behavior in isolation and in free-foraging colonies. We found that individually-isolated flagella-less bees under constant laboratory conditions show robust circadian rhythms in locomotor activity. In observation hives, flagella-less bees cared for the brood, but were more active during the day. By contrast, sham-treated bees were active around the clock as typical of nurses. Detailed video recordings showed that the brood-tending behavior of flagella-less and sham-treated bees is similar. These observations suggest that the difference in the patterns of brood care activity is not because the flagella-less bees did not contact the brood. Our results suggest that nurses are able to find the brood in the dark environment of the hive without their flagella, perhaps by using other sensory organs. The higher activity of flagella-less bees during the day further suggests that the flagella are involved in mediating the brood signals modulating plasticity in the circadian system.

To study the effect of spatio-temporal variation in resource distribution on pollen use and productivity, we identified pollen from spatially explicit nest collections of two generalist sweat bees, Megalopta genalis Meade-Waldo and M. centralis Friese, from Barro Colorado Island, Panama, a 50-ha forest dynamics plot during the 2007 dry and early wet seasons. Pollen from nests collected in 19981999 without spatial information was also identified. 3. Bees used pollen of at least 64 species; many of these occurred in only one collection. The 2007 collections contained pollen of 35 different species, but were dominated by five species, especially Hura crepitans L. and Pseudobombax septenatum (Jacq.) Dugand. 4. Temporal availability, but not distance from nest, influenced flower use at a 50-ha scale. 5. Body size was not associated with minimum flight distance as inferred from pollen collections. 6. Nest productivity and pollen diversity decreased from the dry to wet seasons, mirroring community-level availability of floral resources. 7.

Current methods for examining their nest structure, such as natal cells and contents of storage cells, are destructive in nature because the cells need to be opened for physical inspections. This research describes how the internal structures of the artificial nests of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris L.

For the first time, B. terrestris nest structures, and their contents such as larvae, pupae and eggs, were non-invaseively viewed and assessed. This technique will enable future experiments to take morphological measurements of egg, larval, and pupal development over time. Moreover, combining these measurements with measures of food-storage will provide a good assessment of colony health. The method will also allow tracking of individually marked adults, to monitor their behaviour and help gain a better understanding of the processes involved in the global declines of B. terrestris, which will in turn promote better management of these valuable pollinators.",,,,"Greco, Mark K/S-5541-2019","Greco, Mark K/0000-0002-2136-5127; Sadd, Ben/0000-0003-3136-5144",,,,,,,,,,,,1536-2442,,,,,Jul-20,2012,12,,,,,,1,6,85,,,,,,,,WOS:000306643800001,23421622,,,,

These studies focused at a limited range of heavy metals and highly contrasting locations, and sampling was rarely repeated over a prolonged period. In our study, the potential of honeybees to detect and monitor metal pollution was further explored by measuring the concentration in adult honeybees of a wide range of trace metals, nine of which were not studied before, at three locations in the Netherlands over a 3-month period.

Anthesis in large cardamom took place in the early morning (around 5:30 am) and flowers offer plenty of anthers and moderate amount of nectar to floral visitors. There were four floral visitors; bumble bee (Apis braviceps Smith), honey bee (Apis cerena), fruit fly (Bactocera sp.) and moth (Udaspes folus), and among them A. braviceps was found to be the major pollinator due to its high pollination efficiency attributed to its big body size and foraging habit, while A. cerena acts as a pollen robber. Each flower receives 45.92 visits of bumble bee with the foraging time of 118.93 seconds in a day. Pollination efficiency of bumble bee was as high as 100% while honey bee could pollinate only 8.41% of flower. Bumble bee delivers pollens in the receptive cup pf stigma, in contrary honey on the non-receptive hairs surrounding stigma cup. Nectar secretion begins at 9 hr on the day anthesis and reaches to its peak at 14 hr, followed by reduction in nectar production. A temperature range of 25-28 degrees C and air humidity of 50-60% favoured high nectar production. Increase in 0.77 unit of temperature and decrease in 2.04 unit of air humidity resulted in 1 unit increase in nectar content. The visitation frequency and foraging time of bumble bee were not correlated with the nectar production. Bumble bee and honey bee had almost equal pollen load, but pollen carrying mechanism was quite different as honey bee carries pollen in pollen basket and bumble bee on its head and thorax. Stigma became receptive 12 hr before anthesis (protogynous) and remains receptive even after 15 hr of flower senescence.

The view that round dances and waggle dances are distinct recruitment signals has been revised in light of the finding that distance and direction information are encoded (albeit imprecisely) in round dances. It has remained unclear, however, whether dance followers can use the location information in round dances. In the present study, we looked at recruitment to nearby food sources and found that dance followers can use the directional information in the dances advertising these food sources. Directional bias in recruitment was found for food sources as close as 5 m from the hive. Controls for effects of assembly pheromone and bee presence at the advertised food sources indicate that these factors play a minimal role, relative to dance information, in producing the directional recruitment. Our results provide further support for the view that round dances are best viewed as waggle dances indicating nearby food sources, not as a separate type of dance.

The video-tracking system EthoVisionXT (Noldus Information Technologies) was used to measure the effects of sublethal exposure to tau-fluvalinate and imidacloprid on honey bee locomotion, interactions, and time spent near a food source over a 24-h observation period. Bees were either treated topically with 0.3, 1.5, and 3?mu g tau-fluvalinate or exposed to 0.05, 0.5, 5.0, 50, and 500 ppb imidacloprid in a sugar agar cube. Tau-fluvalinate caused a significant reduction in distance moved at all dose levels (p?<?0.05), as did 50 and 500 ppb imidacloprid (p?<?0.001). Bees exposed to 50 and 500 ppb spent significantly more time near the food source than control bees (p?<?0.05). Interaction time decreased as time in the food zone increased for both chemicals.

Fields managed under AES for cirl buntings (low-input spring barley or permanent pasture without inputs) were contrasted with control fields under conventional management (spring barley without management restrictions and winter cereals, or grazed without management restrictions) to identify such benefits for vascular plants, butterflies, bumblebees, carabid beetles, foliar invertebrates and bats. Activity-density and species richness of carabid beetles were both higher in AES spring barley fields than in control spring barley and winter cereal fields. Forb cover and abundance of butterflies and bumblebees were higher in AES spring barley fields than in winter cereals, but did not differ between AES and control spring barley. No difference was observed in plant species richness between any of the arable field types. Plant species richness and butterfly abundance were higher in AES pasture fields than in controls. Abundance, activity-density and/or species richness of other taxa did not differ between AES and control pastures. Benefits observed in AES spring barley fields arise from management specific to AES agreements, and also, we suggest, from the maintenance of spring-sown barley in the landscape. Benefits in AES pasture fields are ascribed to the absence of fertiliser and pesticide inputs, and reductions in stocking arising from this; there is also likely to have been some pre-selection for older pastures to be entered into AES management agreements. Agri-environment measures for cirl buntings have benefits for a range of taxa beyond the target species, and therefore, largely through reduction of management intensity and maintenance of land-use diversity, improve the overall biodiversity of the farmed landscape where they are present.",,,,,"Walker, Leila/0000-0002-6606-4504",,,,,,,,,,,,0960-3115,1572-9710,,,,JUN,2012,21,6,,,,,1477,1492,,10.1007/s10531-012-0258-6,,,,,,,WOS:000303508800009,,,,,

However, there is some inconsistency in the literature as to how these communities should best be managed. To address this issue, we collected bees from an intensively managed agricultural region in eastern Australia using blue vane traps. Both linear remnants of vegetation, which form part of a larger corridor network, and adjacent fields of native and exotic pastures, wheat, canola, and lucerne were sampled. A total of 3249 individual bees, representing four families and 36 species were collected. Highly modified environments of nectar-bearing crop supported the most species-rich bee assemblages, and the highest abundance of individual bee species. Distance from the remnants did not limit the body size of species occupying fields (up to 400 m). However, richness of bee assemblages also responded positively to the presence of conservation land in nearby areas, or the number of remnant native trees surrounding traps. Linear remnants of native vegetation contributed to assemblage heterogeneity by adding unique species to the regional pool. Our findings indicate that agricultural industries that currently rely on pollination by A. mellifera should ensure that intensive land use is complemented by untilled areas in the form of conservation land, or farm dams and scattered trees in fields, to support wild pollinators that may act as insurance against further future losses of managed hives.

Few studies, however, have directly assessed the spatiotemporal variation in resource availability that arises from landscape pattern, or its effect on populations and population dynamic parameters. We tested the effect of floral resource availability at the landscape scale on the numbers of worker, male, and queen offspring produced by bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, colonies experimentally placed within complex agricultural-natural landscapes. We quantified flower densities in all land use types at different times of the season and then used these data to calculate spatially explicit estimates of floral resources surrounding each colony. Floral availability strongly correlated with landscape structure, and different regions of the landscape showed distinct seasonal patterns of floral availability. The floral resources available in the landscape surrounding a colony positively affected the number of workers and males it produced. Production was more sensitive to early- than to later-season resources. Floral resources did not significantly affect queen production despite a strong correlation between worker number and queen number among colonies. No landscape produced high floral resources during both the early and late season, and seasonal consistency is likely required for greater queen production. Floral resources are important determinants of colony growth and likely affect the pollination services provided by bumble bees at a landscape scale. Spatiotemporal variation in floral resources across the landscape precludes a simple relationship between resources and reproductive success as measured by queens, but nonetheless likely influences the total abundance of bumble bees in our study region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,MAY,2012,93,5,,,,,1049,1058,,10.1890/11-1006.1,,,,,,,WOS:000304368100010,22764491,,,,

Based on chemical analyses, physiological recordings from the antenna (electroantennograms) and the antennal lobe (calcium imaging), and behavioral assays (associative conditioning of the proboscis extension response), we present evidence that ethyl oleate is most abundant on the cuticle, received by olfactory receptors on the antenna, processed in glomeruli of the antennal lobe, and learned in olfactory centers of the brain.

Consequently, the colony achieves an effective collection of food. However, it is still not fully understood how much effect the dance behavior has on the food collection, because most of the relevant experiments have been performed only in limited locations under limited experimental conditions. Here, we examined the efficacy of the waggle dances by physically preventing bees from dancing and then analyzing the changes in daily mass of the hive as an index of daily food collection. To eliminate place-and year-specific effects, the experiments were performed under fully natural conditions in three different cities in Japan from mid September to early October in three different years. Because the experiments were performed in autumn, all six of the tested colonies lost mass on most of the experimental days. When the dance was prevented, the daily reduction in mass change was greater than when the dance was allowed, i.e. the dance inhibited the reduction of the hive mass. This indicates that dance is effective for food collection. Furthermore, clear inhibition was observed on the first two days of the experiments; after that, inhibition was no longer evident.

Endothermic activity is directly linked to respiration. However, knowledge on wasp respiration is sparse and almost nothing is known about their resting metabolism. We investigated the yellowjackets' CO2 production in a flow-through respirometer chamber overnight. Endothermic and behavioral activity was observed by real-time infrared thermography. Most resting wasps were ectothermic or only slightly endothermic (thoracic temperature excess against abdomen < 0.6 degrees C). In the investigated temperature range (T-a = 2.9-42.4 degrees C) mean CO2 production rate of resting wasps increased steeply according to an exponential function, from 5.658 mu l g(-1) min(-1) at 8.3 degrees C to 8.504 mu l g(-1) min(-1) at 20.2 degrees C, 58.686 mu l g(-1) min(-1) at 35.3 degrees C and 102.84 mu l g(-1) min(-1) at 40 degrees C. The wasps' respiratory critical thermal maximum (CTmax), marking the upper edge of their viable temperature range, was 45.3 degrees C. The respiratory CTmax did not differ significantly from the activity CTmax of 44.9 degrees C. CTmax values were considerably below that of honeybees (48.9 and 49.0 degrees C for respiration and activity, respectively). This allows honeybees to kill wasps by heat-balling. Comparison with other arthropods showed that vespine wasps are among the insects with the highest mass-specific resting metabolic rate and the steepest increase of metabolism with ambient temperature.

Any decline of these pollinators is therefore of great concern for ecosystem functioning. Increased parasite pressures have been discussed as a major factor for the loss of pollinators. One of the main parasites of bumblebees is Nosema bombi, an intracellular microsporidian parasite with considerable impact on the vitality of the host. Here we study the effect of host colony density and host genetic variability on N. bombi infections in natural populations of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We sampled males and workers from six B. terrestris populations located in an agricultural landscape in Middle Sweden to determine the prevalence and degree of N. bombi infections. All individuals were genotyped with five microsatellite markers to infer the colony densities in the sampled populations and the genetic variability of the host population. We confirmed that genetic variability and sex significantly correlate with the degree of infection with N. bombi. Males and workers with lower genetic variability had significantly higher infection levels than average. Also colony density had a significant impact on the degree of infection, with high density populations having higher infected individuals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

They retain this time memory for several consecutive days even in the absence of nectar rewards. Recent work has identified 2 classes of forager: ""persistent"" foragers that reconnoiter a known food source to ascertain its status and ""reticent"" foragers that apparently wait in the hive for a waggle dance confirming source availability. Surprisingly, a foraging group contains 40-90% persistent foragers, depending on experience at the source. What is the benefit in sending so many foragers to investigate a source when only a few foragers are required to reactivate the entire group? We used an agent-based software model to test the energetics underlying several different ratios of persistent and reticent individuals in the foraging group while varying 6 ecological factors: forager group size, source distance, source sucrose concentration, source availability in hours, number of days the source is known to the colony, and the rate at which new unemployed foragers appear on the dance floor. Our model demonstrates 2 primary explanations. First, a large number of persistent foragers are needed to ensure that at least some foragers will reconnoiter their source early in its availability, thus enabling the group to effectively exploit the source. Second, the cost of a reconnaissance flight is negligible compared with even a single successful foraging trip.",,,,,"Van Nest, Byron/0000-0002-4650-6264",,,,,,,,,,,,1045-2249,,,,,MAY-JUN,2012,23,3,,,,,649,658,,10.1093/beheco/ars010,,,,,,,WOS:000302485200025,,,,,

Population persistence in fragmented areas depends on dispersal potential and maintenance of gene flow among fragments of habitat. Here we used population genetic techniques to characterize, for two equally abundant orchid bee species that differ in their physiology and ecology, levels of genetic differentiation among fragments of tropical forest in southeastern Costa Rica in a similar to 200 km(2) landscape. We measured population differentiation with phi(PT) (an analogue to the traditional summary statistic Fst), as well as two measures that may more accurately reflect the level of differentiation when highly variable loci are used: G'st and D-est. We also calculated pairwise genetic distances among individuals and conducted Mantel tests to test the correlation of genetic and geographic distance, for each species. We found strong differences in genetic structure between the species. Contrary to our expectations, each measure of genetic structure revealed that the larger-bodied species, Eulaema bombiformis, had higher levels of differentiation than the smaller species, Euglossa championi. Furthermore, for Eulaema bombiformis there was a significant positive correlation of genetic and geographic distance while for Euglossa championi there was no significant positive correlation.

Foraging in ants is often a pheromonally mediated collective action performed by mature workers; age-dependent diVerences in olfactory response thresholds may therefore proximately regulate task repertoire development. In the ant Pheidole dentata, foraging activity increases with chronological age in minor workers, and is chemically controlled. The onset of foraging in minor workers is accompanied by marked neuroanatomical and neurochemical changes, including synaptic remodeling in olfactory regions of the brain, proliferation of serotonergic neurons, and increased brain titers of monoamines, notably serotonin. We examined the linkage of serotonin and olfactory responsiveness by assaying trail-following performance in mature P. dentata minor workers with normal serotonin levels, or serotonin levels experimentally lowered by oral administration of the serotonin synthesis inhibitor alpha-methyltryptophan (AMTP). By assessing responsiveness to standardized pheromone trails, we demonstrate that trail-following behaviors are significantly reduced in serotonin-depleted workers. AMTP-treated individuals were less likely to initiate trail following, and oriented along pheromone trails for significantly shorter distances than untreated, similar-age workers.

Among all major clades of bees, Colletidae has been a prime example of an ancient group whose Gondwanan origin probably precedes the complete break-up of Africa, Antarctica, Australia and South America, because modern lineages of this family occur primarily in southern continents. In this paper, we aim to study the temporal and spatial diversification of colletid bees to better understand the processes that have resulted in the present southern disjunctions. Location Southern continents. Methods We assembled a dataset comprising four nuclear genes of a broad sample of Colletidae. We used Bayesian inference analyses to estimate the phylogenetic tree topology and divergence times. Biogeographical relationships were investigated using event-based analytical methods: a Bayesian approach to dispersal-vicariance analysis, a likelihood-based dispersal-extinctioncladogenesis model and a Bayesian model. We also used lineage through time analyses to explore the tempo of radiations of Colletidae and their context in the biogeographical history of these bees. Results Initial diversification of Colletidae took place at the Late Cretaceous (70 Ma). Several (6-14) lineage exchanges between Australia and South America via Antarctica during the Late Cretaceous and Eocene epochs could explain the disjunctions observed between colletid lineages today. All biogeographical methods consistently indicated that there were multiple lineage exchanges between South America and Australia, and these approaches were valuable in exploring the degree of uncertainty inherent in the ancestral reconstructions. Biogeographical and dating results preclude an explanation of Scrapterinae in Africa as a result of vicariance, so one dispersal event is assumed to explain the disjunction in relation to Euryglossinae. The net diversification rate was found to be highest in the recent history of colletid evolution. Main conclusions The biogeography and macroevolutionary history of colletid bees can be explained by a combination of Cenozoic vicariance and palaeoclimatic changes during the Neogene. The austral connection and posterior break-up of South America, Antarctica and Australia resulted in a pattern of disjunct sister lineages. Increased biome aridification coupled with floristic diversification in the southern continents during the Neogene may have contributed to the high rates of cladogenesis in these bees in the last 25-30 million years.",,,,"Pie, Marcio/B-7684-2008; Almeida, Eduardo/B-6995-2008","Almeida, Eduardo/0000-0001-6017-6364; Danforth, Bryan/0000-0002-6495-428X",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,MAR,2012,39,3,,,,,526,544,,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02624.x,,,,,,,WOS:000300665400009,,,,,

In contrast, the correlations with green area were more consistent, with bee diversity levelling off after 100 m, while syrphid diversity and visits continued to increase. The variation in the correlation of bee visits was partly accounted for by the large contribution of honeybees. Plant diversity significantly affected bee diversity and visits, and syrphid visits.

Analyses of 56 species were conducted using geometric morphometrics for the wings and lineal morphometrics for the body; independent contrast method regressions were used to correct for the phylogenetic effect. Smaller vespid species exhibit rounded wings, veins that are more concentrated in the proximal region, larger stigmata and the mesosoma is proportionally larger than in larger species. Meanwhile, larger species have more elongated wings, more distally extended venation, smaller stigmata and a proportionally smaller mesosoma.

The loss of functionally important species can reduce a variety of ecosystem functions, such as pollination and seed dispersal, but the intricate relationships between land-use intensity, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are still contentious. Along a gradient from forest to intensively used farmland, we quantified bee species richness, visitation rates of bees and pollination success of wild cherry trees (Prunus avium). We analysed the effects of structural habitat diversity at a local scale and of the proportion of suitable habitat around each tree at a landscape scale. We compared these findings with those from previous studies of seed-dispersing birds and mammals in the same model system and along the same land-use gradient. Bee species richness and visitation rates were found to be highest in structurally simple habitats, whereas bird species richness-but not their visitation rates-were highest in structurally complex habitats. Mammal visitation rates were only influenced at the landscape scale. These results show that different functional groups of animals respond idiosyncratically to gradients in habitat and landscape structure. Despite strong effects on bees and birds, pollination success and bird seed removal did not differ along the land-use gradient at both spatial scales. These results suggest that mobile organisms, such as bees and birds, move over long distances in intensively used landscapes and thereby buffer pollination and seed-dispersal interactions.

Although a minor problem in its native Africa, it is an invasive pest of honey bees in the United States and Australia. Adult beetles enter bee hives to oviposit and feed. Larval development occurs within the hive, but mature larvae leave the hive to pupate in soil. The numbers leaving, which can be estimated by trapping, measure the reproductive success of adult beetles in the hive over any given period of time. We describe a trap designed to intercept mature larvae as they reach the end of the bottom board on their way to the ground. Trap efficiency was estimated by releasing groups of 100 larvae into empty brood boxes and counting the numbers trapped. Some larvae escaped, hut mean efficiency ranged from 87.2 to 94.2%. We envision the trap as a research tool for study of beetle population dynamics, and we used it to track numbers of larvae leaving active hives for pupation in the soil. The traps detected large increases and then decreases in numbers of larvae leaving colonies that weakened and died. They also detected small numbers of larvae leaving strong European and African colonies, even when no larvae were observed in the hives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,,,,,FEB,2012,41,1,,,,,152,158,,10.1603/EN11186,,,,,,,WOS:000299804400017,22525070,,,,

We examined the spatial genetic structure of the understory tree Cornus florida (Cornaceae) adults (N-Adults = 452) and offspring (N-Offspring = 736) across two mating events to determine the extent to which pollen pool genetic covariance is influenced by intervening forest architecture. Resident adults showed no spatial partitioning but genotypes were positively autocorrelated up to a distance of 35 m suggesting a pattern of restricted seed dispersal. In the offspring, selfing rates were small (s(m) = 0.035) whereas both biparental inbreeding (s(b;open) (canopy) = 0.16, s(b;closed canopy) = 0.11) and correlated paternity (r(p;open canopy) = 0.21, r(p;closed canopy) = 0.07) were significantly influenced by primary canopy opening above individual mothers. The spatial distribution of genetic covariance in pollen pool composition was quantified for each reproductive event using Pollination Graphs, a network method based upon multivariate conditional genetic covariance. The georeferenced graph topology revealed a significant positive relationship between genetic covariance and pollinator movement through C. florida canopies, a negative relationship with open primary canopy (e. g., roads under open canopies and fields with no primary canopy), and no relationship with either conifer or mixed hardwood canopy species cover. These results suggest that both resident genetic structure within stands and genetic connectivity between sites in C. florida populations are influenced by spatial heterogeneity of mating individuals and quality of intervening canopy cover.",,,,"Dyer, Rodney J./H-1897-2011","Dyer, Rodney J./0000-0003-4707-3453",,,,,,,,,,,,0921-2973,1572-9761,,,,FEB,2012,27,2,,,SI,,239,251,,10.1007/s10980-011-9696-x,,,,,,,WOS:000300088700008,,,,,

Wild bees are one of the most important groups of pollinators in the temperate zone. Therefore, population declines have potentially negative impacts for both crop and wildflower pollination. Although heavy metal pollution is recognized to be a problem affecting large parts of the European Union, we currently lack insights into the effects of heavy metals on wild bees. 2. We investigated whether heavy metal pollution is a potential threat to wild bee communities by comparing (i) species number, (ii) diversity and (iii) abundance as well as (iv) natural mortality of emerging bees along two independent gradients of heavy metal pollution, one at Olkusz (OLK), Poland and the other at Avonmouth (AVO), UK. We used standardized nesting traps to measure species richness and abundance of wild bees, and we recorded the heavy metal concentration in pollen collected by the red mason bee Osmia rufa as a measure of pollution. 3. The concentration of cadmium, lead and zinc in pollen collected by bees ranged from a background level in unpolluted sites [OLK: 1 3, 43 4, 99 8 (mg kg(-1)); AVO: 0 8, 42 0, 56 0 (mg kg(-1)), respectively] to a high level on sites in the vicinity of the OLK and AVO smelters [OLK: 6.7, 277.0, 440.1 (mg kg(-1)); AVO: 9.3, 356.2, 592.4 (mg kg(-1)), respectively]. 4. We found that with increasing heavy metal concentration, there was a steady decrease in the number, diversity and abundance of solitary, wild bees. In the most polluted sites, traps were empty or contained single occupants, whereas in unpolluted sites, the nesting traps collected from 4 to 5 species represented by up to ten individuals. Moreover, the proportion of dead individuals of the solitary bee Megachile ligniseca increased along the heavy metal pollution gradient at OLK from 0.2 in uncontaminated sites to 0.5 in sites with a high concentration of pollution. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings highlight the negative relationship between heavy metal pollution and populations of wild bees and suggest that increasing wild bee richness in highly contaminated areas will require special conservation strategies. These may include creating suitable nesting sites and sowing a mixture of flowering plants as well as installing artificial nests with wild bee cocoons in polluted areas.

Increasing urbanisation is often cited as a cause of declining biodiversity, but for bumblebees there is evidence that urban populations of some species such as Bombus terrestris L. may be more dense than those found in agricultural landscapes, perhaps because gardens provide plentiful floral resources and nesting opportunities. 2. Here we examine the influence of urbanisation on the prevalence of the main protozoan parasites of bumblebees in west central Scotland. We would expect transmission rates and prevalence of parasites to be higher in high density host populations, all else being equal. 3. Workers of two bee species, B. terrestris and B. pascuorum, were sampled over a 45-day period in mid to late summer, and parasites were detected in faeces and via dissection. A comparison of the two methods suggests that faecal sampling is considerably less sensitive than dissection, failing to detect infection in 27.8%, 55.1%, and 80% of cases of infection with the parasites Crithidia bombi, Nosema bombi, and Apicystis bombi, respectively. 4. For all three parasites, broad patterns of prevalence were similar, with prevalence tending to increase with urbanisation in B. terrestris but not in B. pascuorum. The different patterns of seasonal prevalence in the two bee species suggest that intraspecific transmission is more important that interspecific transmission. 5. Our observation of greater parasite prevalence among B. terrestris in urban compared with rural areas suggests that urban habitats may present greater opportunities for parasite transmission. Greater bee densities in urban areas may be the driving factor; however, further study is still needed. For example, differences in disease prevalence between habitats could be driven by differences in the types and abundance of flowers that are available, or in exposure to environmental stressors.",,,,"Goulson, David/A-2462-2010","Goulson, David/0000-0003-4421-2876; Whitehorn, Penelope/0000-0001-9852-1012",,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,1365-2311,,,,FEB,2012,37,1,,,,,83,89,,10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01334.x,,,,,,,WOS:000299253000010,,,,,

Alternative approaches include heuristic methods that employ iterative optimization procedures for detecting multiple circles. Since only one circle can be marked at each optimization cycle, multiple executions ought to be enforced in order to achieve multi-detection. This paper presents an algorithm for automatic detection of multiple circular shapes that considers the overall process as a multi-modal optimization problem. The approach is based on the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, a swarm optimization algorithm inspired by the intelligent foraging behavior of honeybees. Unlike the original ABC algorithm, the proposed approach presents the addition of a memory for discarded solutions. Such memory allows holding important information regarding other local optima, which might have emerged during the optimization process. The detector uses a combination of three non-collinear edge points as parameters to determine circle candidates. A matching function (nectar-amount) determines if such circle candidates (bee-food sources) are actually present in the image. Guided by the values of such matching functions, the set of encoded candidate circles are evolved through the ABC algorithm so that the best candidate (global optimum) can be fitted into an actual circle within the edge-only image. Then, an analysis of the incorporated memory is executed in order to identify potential local optima, i.e., other circles. The proposed method is able to detect single or multiple circles from a digital image through only one optimization pass.

It is unknown, however, how different small-and large-scale habitat patches interact as pollinator sources. In the intensively managed Argentine Pampas, we studied the additive and interactive effects of large expanses (up to 2200 ha) of natural habitat, represented by untilled isolated ""sierras"", and narrow (3-7 m wide) strips of semi-natural habitat, represented by field margins, as pollinator sources for sunflower (Helianthus annus). We estimated visitation rates by feral honey-bees, Apis mellifera, and native flower visitors (as a group) at 1, 5, 25, 50 and 100 m from a field margin in 17 sunflower fields 0-10 km distant from the nearest sierra. Honey-bees dominated the pollinator assemblage accounting for >90% of all visits to sunflower inflorescences. Honey-bee visitation was strongly affected by proximity to the sierras decreasing by about 70% in the most isolated fields. There was also a decline in honey-bee visitation with distance from the field margin, which was apparent with increasing field isolation, but undetected in fields nearby large expanses of natural habitat. The probability of observing a native visitor decreased with isolation from the sierras, but in other respects visitation by flower visitors other than honey-bees was mostly unaffected by the habitat factors assessed in this study. Overall, we found strong hierarchical and interactive effects between the study large and small-scale pollinator sources.

Agricultural intensification and loss of wild floral resources rank among the main factors contributing to this decline. Landscape enhancement of floral resources has been proposed as an agro-environmental scheme intended to provide honeybees with compensatory food sources in intensive agrosystems. Floral scheme efficiency has rarely been evaluated with respect to landscape context. In this study, we developed and validated a modeling tool to delineate the landscape areas likely to be associated with higher efficiency of floral enhancement schemes. In particular, the proximity of some landscape elements used by honeybees, either as foraging habitat or as visual landmark for orientation, may partly determine floral scheme efficiency. We investigated this issue using resource selection functions (RSFs), i.e. models that aim to predict the occurrence of foraging honeybees at floral patches as a function of the presence of keystone landscape elements in their proximity. However, deciding which landscape elements are effectively in the proximity or not is mostly a matter of subjectivity. The novelty of our approach resides in its use of a distance-weighting function to explicitly account for the spatial location of surrounding landscape elements. In that respect, a distance function should be scaled on movement patterns of foraging organisms. Herein, we inferred movement patterns from the autocorrelative properties of honeybee foraging activity. This modeling approach was developed on Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia) field margin strips, a typical ""honeybee-friendly"" floral scheme. A foraging survey conducted on 170 Phacelia plots (2 m x 2 m) from 17 Phacelia strips, all positioned within the foraging range of an experimental apiary, revealed that (i) the floral scheme efficiency is positively influenced by the presence of linear landscape elements such as hedgerows and forest edges, but negatively affected by the presence of alternative floral resources, and that (ii) weighting the relative importance of those landscape elements by incorporating a distance function into models considerably improved their predictive power. This modeling tool has the potential to help land managers optimizing their financial investment by avoiding low-efficiency landscape areas, or favoring high-efficiency ones, at the time of planning floral enhancement schemes.

What bees see while navigating, depends on the appearance of the cues, the bee's current position, orientation, and movement relative to them. Here we analyze the detailed flight behavior during the localization of a goal surrounded by cylinders that are characterized either by a high contrast in luminance and texture or by mostly motion contrast relative to the background. By relating flight behavior to the nature of the information available from these landmarks, we aim to identify behavioral strategies that facilitate the processing of visual information during goal localization. We decompose flight behavior into prototypical movements using clustering algorithms in order to reduce the behavioral complexity. The determined prototypical movements reflect the honeybee's saccadic flight pattern that largely separates rotational from translational movements. During phases of translational movements between fast saccadic rotations, the bees can gain information about the 3D layout of their environment from the translational optic flow. The prototypical movements reveal the prominent role of sideways and up-or downward movements, which can help bees to gather information about objects, particularly in the frontal visual field. We find that the occurrence of specific prototypes depends on the bees' distance from the landmarks and the feeder and that changing the texture of the landmarks evokes different prototypical movements. The adaptive use of different behavioral prototypes shapes the visual input and can facilitate information processing in the bees' visual system during local navigation.",,,,"Egelhaaf, Martin/A-9824-2010","Egelhaaf, Martin/0000-0002-9336-4270",,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5153,,,,,Jan-18,2012,6,,,,,,,,1,10.3389/fnbeh.2012.00001,,,,,,,WOS:000299810200001,22279431,,,,

Monarch butterflies and locusts traverse continents [1, 2], and foraging bees and ants travel hundreds of meters to return to their nests [1, 3, 4], whereas many other insects fly straight for only a few centimeters before changing direction. Despite this variation in spatial scale, the brain region thought to underlie long-distance navigation is remarkably conserved [5, 6], suggesting that the use of a celestial compass is a general and perhaps ancient capability of insects. Laboratory studies of Drosophila have identified a local search mode in which short, straight segments are interspersed with rapid turns [7, 8]. However, this flight mode is inconsistent with measured gene flow between geographically separated populations [9-11], and individual Drosophila can travel 10 km across desert terrain in a single night [9, 12, 13]-a feat that would be impossible without prolonged periods of straight flight. To directly examine orientation behavior under outdoor conditions, we built a portable flight arena in which a fly viewed the natural sky through a liquid crystal device that could experimentally rotate the polarization angle.

A variety of stressors have been implicated as potential causes, including agricultural pesticides. Neonicotinoid insecticides, which are widely used and highly toxic to honey bees, have been found in previous analyses of honey bee pollen and comb material. However, the routes of exposure have remained largely undefined. We used LC/MS-MS to analyze samples of honey bees, pollen stored in the hive and several potential exposure routes associated with plantings of neonicotinoid treated maize. Our results demonstrate that bees are exposed to these compounds and several other agricultural pesticides in several ways throughout the foraging period. During spring, extremely high levels of clothianidin and thiamethoxam were found in planter exhaust material produced during the planting of treated maize seed. We also found neonicotinoids in the soil of each field we sampled, including unplanted fields. Plants visited by foraging bees (dandelions) growing near these fields were found to contain neonicotinoids as well. This indicates deposition of neonicotinoids on the flowers, uptake by the root system, or both. Dead bees collected near hive entrances during the spring sampling period were found to contain clothianidin as well, although whether exposure was oral (consuming pollen) or by contact (soil/planter dust) is unclear. We also detected the insecticide clothianidin in pollen collected by bees and stored in the hive. When maize plants in our field reached anthesis, maize pollen from treated seed was found to contain clothianidin and other pesticides; and honey bees in our study readily collected maize pollen. These findings clarify some of the mechanisms by which honey bees may be exposed to agricultural pesticides throughout the growing season.

Post-fire plant communities change in their composition, structure, floral resources, as well as seed and fruit resources. Fire directly affects communities of pollinators, seed dispersers, and seed predators mainly by mortality, and indirectly through changes in the quality and quantity of food and nesting resources. Pollinators, seed-dispersers, and seed predators depend on plant community composition and on the flower, seed, and fruit resources they produce. As a consequence, their community composition, structure, and function are expected to vary in response to post-fire temporal and spatial changes in plant communities, which in turn depend on fire severity, frequency, scale, and the distance from fire-edge, as well as their foraging range. In return, the changes resulting from fire in pollinator, seed-disperser and seed predator communities may affect plant fecundity and plant community composition.",,,,"Izhaki, Ido/I-9712-2019","Izhaki, Ido/0000-0002-4525-4683",,,,,,,,,,,,1565-9801,,,,,,2012,58,2-Mar,,,SI,,235,250,,10.1560/IJEE.58.2-3.235,,,,,,,WOS:000318985200011,,,,,

These in turn are expected to respond to plant population size and flower density. High floral densities for example usually attract large numbers of pollinators that visit more flowers per plant or patch, which increases pollen deposition at short distances. Thus, population characteristics might serve as indicators for pollen dispersal patterns and help to identify suitable habitat size and quality for conservation measures. To test this hypothesis, we observed floral visitors of a generalist, entomophilous species, Comarum palustre, and compared their abundance and visitation rates in populations of different sizes and flower densities. At the same time, we mimicked pollen flow using fluorescent dye. In the large and dense populations, pollinator abundance and visitation rates were high and dye was dispersed to the edges of the populations (up to 200 m). In the medium-sized population with high flower density, insect abundance and visitation rates were unexpectedly low and dye dispersal declined very quickly. On the contrary, in the smallest population with scattered flowers, especially bumble bee abundance was similar to the large populations and dye dispersal mirrored this high bumble bee activity. Thus, our results indicate that in smaller habitat fragments, the mere size of a population might be insufficient to suggest pollen flow for a plant species.

When two feeders were each placed 400 m away from the hive in different directions, a virtual colony in which honeybees danced and correctly transferred information (a normal, real bee colony) made significantly greater numbers of successful visits to the feeders compared to a colony with inaccurate information transfer. Howerer, when five feeders were each located 400 m from the hive, the inaccurate information transfer colony performed better than the normal colony.

The syndromes of nest relocation include legionary nomadism, unstable nesting, intrinsic nest relocation, and adventitious nest relocation. The emergence of nest movement is a functional response to a broad range of potential selective forces, including colony growth, competition, foraging efficiency, microclimate, nest deterioration, nest quality, parasitism, predation, and seasonality.

Sealed brood combs from five colonies were removed, emerging bees were marked with paint, released back into their colonies of origin, and collected as recently emerged (0-3 days old), as house bees (8-11 days old), and as foragers (22-25 days old). Fifty bees from each of the five colonies were processed individually at each collection date for the intensity and prevalence of N. ceranae infection. Using PCR and specific primers to differentiate Nosema species, N. ceranae was found to be the only species present during the experiment. At each collection age (recent emergence, house, forager) an additional sample from the inner hive cover (background bees = BC) of each colony was collected to compare the N. ceranae results of this sampling method, commonly used for Nosema spore quantification, to the samples comprised of marked bees of known ages. No recently emerged bees exhibited infection with N. ceranae. One house bee out of the 250 individuals analyzed (prevalence = 0.4%) tested positive for N. ceranae, at an infection level of 3.35 x 10(6) spores. Infection levels were not statistically different between the recently emerged (mean = 0 spores/bee) and house bees (mean = 1.34 x 10(4) spores/bee) (P = 0.99).

The average infection level across all foragers was significantly higher than that of recently emerged bees (P = 0.01) and house bees (P = 0.01).

The number of bees entering a foraging arena was positively correlated with food sucrose concentration (0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 M sucrose, equal to 16-65% w/w). Foragers spent significantly more time imbibing higher concentration solutions. Foragers then returned to the nest where they moved in elaborate paths at variable speeds. There was no significant effect of sucrose concentration on average forager velocity or time spent inside the nest. However, the length of a forager's path inside the nest (total of all distances moved each 0.1 s) significantly increased with sucrose concentration. On average, individuals foraging on 2.5 M and 1.0 M solution walked paths respectively 1.6 fold and 1.4 longer than the paths of individuals foraging on 0.5 M solution.

This review describes a range of experiments carried out with free-flying forager honeybees under such conditions. The research done over the past 30 or so years suggests that cognitive abilities (learning and perception) in insects are more intricate and flexible than was originally imagined. It has become apparent that honeybees are capable of a variety of visually guided tasks, involving decision making under challenging situations: this includes simultaneously making use of different sensory modalities, such as vision and olfaction, and learning to use abstract concepts such as ""sameness"" and ""difference."" Many studies have shown that decision making in foraging honeybees is highly flexible. The trained animals learn how to solve a task, and do so with a high accuracy, but when they are presented with a new variation of the task, they apply the learnt rules from the earlier setup to the new situation, and solve the new task as well. Honeybees therefore not only feature a rich behavioral repertoire to choose from, but also make decisions most apt to the current situation.

The analyses of temporal population sub-structure based on both colony detection rate over time and the clustering software STRUCTURE consistently suggested one large and temporally unstructured male population.

During nectar and pollen foraging in a temperate climate, honeybees are exposed to a broad range of ambient temperatures, challenging their thermoregulatory ability. The body temperature that the bees exhibit results from endothermic heat production, exogenous heat gain from solar radiation, and heat loss. In addition to profitability of foraging, season was suggested to have a considerable influence on thermoregulation. To assess the relative importance of these factors, the thermoregulatory behaviour of foragers on 33 flowering plants in dependence on season and environmental factors was investigated. 2. The bees (Apis mellifera carnica Pollman) were always endothermic. On average, the thorax surface temperature (T(th)) was regulated at a high and rather constant level over a broad range of ambient temperatures (T(th) = 33.7- 35.7 degrees C, T(a) = 10- 27 degrees C). However, at a certain T(a), T(th) showed a strong variation, depending on the plants from which the bees were foraging. At warmer conditions (T(a) = 27- 32 degrees C) the T(th) increased nearly linearly with T(a) to a maximal average level of 42.6 degrees C. The thorax temperature excess decreased strongly with increasing T(a) (T(th) - T(a) = 21.6 - 3.6 degrees C). 3. The bees used the heat gain from solar radiation to elevate the temperature excess of thorax, head, and abdomen. Seasonal dependance was reflected in a 2.7. C higher mean T(th) in the spring than in the summer. An anova revealed that season had the greatest effect on T(th), followed by T(a) and radiation. 4. It was presumed the foragers' motivational status to be the main factor responsible for the variation of T(th) between seasons and different plants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,,,,,DEC,2011,36,6,,,,,686,699,,10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01313.x,,,,,,,WOS:000297162500004,22419834,,,,

Tests of ODT have however so far mainly been restricted to laboratory settings. By video surveillance, we gathered a large data set of more than 2000 field observations of crab spider (Misumena vatia) encounters with potential prey. We then tested whether the complex ODT or two simpler models (prey identity and prey traits) best explain foraging decisions. Insect prey were killed with an average chance of 3.5% when alighting on an inflorescence harboring a spider. Spiders refused to attack suitable prey in 46-79% of encounters when prey was in attack range, indicating an over-abundance of prey relative to the needs of the spiders. Reduction of opportunities to capture prey along the prey capture sequence differed among pollinator groups, with syrphids and solitary bees showing strong avoidance of spiders early in the sequence and bumblebees resisting the final strike. Simple prey traits explained foraging decisions better than ODT, which was not supported. In the absence of food limitation, optimality decisions may be less stringent. The over-abundance of prey indicates that, in contrast to current theory, prey encounter rates are not the most important factor driving predator foraging decisions. Our results are highly coherent with those obtained in earlier field studies on patch leaving strategies and predator-prey encounters. Prey overabundance and non-optimal predator behavior are apparently not uncommon in nature, and we highlight some of the implications for predator-prey theory.",,,,"Bacher, Sven/F-5431-2010; Casas, Jerome/D-9620-2011","Bacher, Sven/0000-0001-5147-7165; Casas, Jerome/0000-0003-1666-295X",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,DEC,2011,2,12,,,,,,,UNSP 133,10.1890/ES11-00323.1,,,,,,,WOS:000208811300005,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrate that traplining bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) make a trade-off between minimizing travel distance and prioritizing the most rewarding feeding locations. 3. Individual bees trained to forage on five artificial flowers of equal reward value selected the shortest possible route as a trapline. After introducing a single highly rewarding flower to the array, they re-adjusted their routes visiting the most rewarding flower first provided the departure distance from the shortest possible route remained small (18%). When routes optimizing the initial rate of reward intake were much longer (42%), bees prioritized short travel distances. 4. Under natural conditions, in which individual flowers vary in nectar productivity and replenish continuously, it might pay bees to prioritize highly rewarding locations, both to minimize the overall number of flowers to visit and to beat competitors. 5.

In addition to indicating the position (distance, direction) of a food patch, both the occurrence and frequency of the dances depend on the profitability of the exploited resource (sugar concentration, solution flow rate). During the waggle dance, successful foragers generate pulsed thoracic vibrations that putatively serve as a source of different kinds of information for hive bees, who cannot visually decode dances in the darkness of the hive. In the present study, we asked whether these vibrations are a reliable estimator of the excitement of the dancer when food profitability changes in terms of both sugar concentration and solution flow rate. The probability of producing thoracic vibrations as well as several features related to their intensity during the waggle phase (pulse duration, velocity amplitude, duty cycle) increased with both these profitability variables. The number of vibratory pulses, however, was independent of sugar concentration and reward rate exploited. Thus, pulse number could indeed be used by dance followers as reliable information about food source distance, as suggested in previous studies.

Path integration and view-based landmark guidance are the key strategies for the ants' navigation. For instance, they memorise different views in a sequence (sequential memory) but also have a step counter that informs them about the covered distance during each foraging trip (odometer). The sequential memory and the odometer information can act as contextual cues during travel for retrieving the appropriate stored view. When and which cue is used at different stages and lengths of the foraging trips is still unknown. In this study, we examined how the Australian desert ant Melophorus bagoti uses sequential memory and odometric information to retrieve visual memories. Using a set-up made out of channels and two-choice boxes (Y-mazes), we demonstrate first that M. bagoti foragers are able to learn and discriminate a variety of visual stimuli in a sequence of views along the inbound trip back to the nest. We then forced the homing ants to encounter a fixed sequence of two visual patterns during their inbound trips. By manipulating the position and distance of the visual stimuli and decision boxes, we could set the two contextual cues (sequential memory and odometer) into conflict. After the short 4-m outbound distance, a preference for odometric information as a contextual cue was found, but after the long 8-m outbound distance, ants relied primarily on their sequential memory retrieval.

To keep track of local time, these clocks use a variety of time cues such as light-dark, temperature, food availability and social interaction cycles. This study assessed the role of social cues in modulating circadian clocks of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Using pair-wise interactions, we first estimated the percentage contribution of each interacting partner on the cumulative rhythmic behaviour of the pairs. Subsequently, we studied the effects of multi-individual (group-wise) interactions on the rhythmic behaviour of the group by estimating phase synchrony between individuals of different strains (having different circadian periods) maintained in both homogeneous and heterogeneous groups. Although it is known that social interactions improve synchrony between interacting individuals, we asked whether such interactions are able to synchronize the circadian rhythms of highly phase-desynchronized flies. We found that, although interactions between fly strains possessing different circadian periods failed to produce synchrony, social interactions among phase-desynchronized flies did enhance the phase synchrony of the interacting individuals. Differently phased individuals living in social groups displayed significantly greater phase synchrony than those living solitarily. Social synchronization is olfaction mediated as group-wise interactions among phase-desynchronized flies possessing compromised olfactory ability (Or83b(0)) did not improve phase synchrony. These results suggest that social cues synchronize the circadian clocks of Drosophila provided that the interacting individuals have similar clock periods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,NOV,2011,214,22,,,,,3742,3750,,10.1242/jeb.057554,,,,,,,WOS:000296581500009,22031738,,,,

One particularly obdurate case has been the species of the subgenus Subterraneobombus. We revise the bees of this subgenus by integrating evidence from both morphology and, for a 5% subsample, from DNA (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, CO1) barcodes from pinned museum specimens. We apply a reciprocal illumination procedure: (1) taxa recognized previously from morphology are used to stratify samples for DNA subsampling; (2) DNA barcodes from these subsamples are used to recognize groups of phylogenetically related specimens; and (3) for these groups, we re-examine morphological characters in order to recognize and diagnose species. A total of 3854 specimens from 1535 samples from across the geographic range of the subgenus throughout the Holarctic and northern Oriental regions are identified to 11 species. This includes one species newly recognized from Mongolia, Bombus mongolensis Williams sp. nov. Taxon concepts are modified substantially for four species, seven lectotypes are designated, and four new synonyms are recognized. The prevailing usage of Bombus distinguendus is maintained as valid by designating Bombus elegans as a nomen oblitum and designating B. distinguendus as a nomen protectum. Identification keys and colour-pattern diagrams are provided, and geographic distributions, elevational ranges, and phenological activity periods are described to characterize the species. An estimate of the biogeographic history is reconstructed with dispersal-vicariance analysis. In this study, DNA barcode data have been a cost-effective source of additional characters for diagnosing groups of specimens. The barcode data contributed directly to recognizing the one new species, of which females remain difficult to identify from morphology alone.

Although floral odors have been implicated in mediating these interactions, identification of the odors-and how the odors are represented in the olfactory system-has been elusive, and the manner in which olfactory learning mediates the generalized plant-insect interactions in the field remains unclear. This review details the composition of floral bouquets that elicit strong attraction in pollinators, demonstrating that for some species of plants the composition of the bouquet plays an important role in exploiting the insect's olfactory system, thereby driving innate attraction, whereas other bouquets can be learned as an associative cue for the nectar reward. By associative learning of nonattractive floral odors with a nectar reward-through octopamine-associated modulation of neurons in the antennal lobe-insects have the ability to exploit alternate floral resources when their preferred flowers are no longer present. Such neural mechanisms, present in specialist and generalist pollinators, provides the means by which pollination associations can range from specialized to generalized while permitting insects to exist within a dynamic floral environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1540-7063,1557-7023,,,,NOV,2011,51,5,,,,,781,793,,10.1093/icb/icr094,,,,,,,WOS:000296101600012,21803792,,,,

To investigate nuclear microsatellites population structure in A. cerana, single workers of A. cerana colonies from Thailand were genotyped at 18 microsatellite loci. The loci showed intermediate to high levels of heterozygosity and a range of allele numbers. The analyses confirmed a fundamental subdivision of the Thai A. cerana population into the ""Asia Mainland"" and ""Sundaland"" regions at the Isthmus of Kra. However, the nuclear microsatellite differentiation was less distinct than mtDNA haplotype differences, suggesting male-biased dispersal and population admixture. Overall, samples showed a weak isolation-by-distance effect. The isolated population on Samui island was most differentiated from the other samples. The results do not support our initial hypothesis of local host-pathogen co-evolution, which predicts a strict correspondence between the nuclear genome and the lineage of parasitic Varroa mite of the A. cerana samples, because the gene flow indicated by our nuclear microsatellite markers should also mix potential Varroa resistance alleles among subpopulations.

However, no studies have determined if this information is redundant or has an additive effect such that multimodal information is more attractive than either modality presented by itself to free-flying bees. We tested the effect of two modalities, forager-deposited odor marks and the visual presence of foragers, on the orientation of stingless bee (Scaptotrigona mexicana) recruits. Our results show that odor marks alone were significantly more attractive than multimodal information, and that multimodal information was significantly more attractive than visual forager presence alone. Given the high olfactory sensitivity and limited visual acuity of insects, odor marks likely attracted recruits over a greater distance than the visual presence of nestmates.

These include insect pollinators, to whom field margins provide both nest sites and important resources (especially when adjacent crops are not in flower). Nesting pollinators travel relatively short distances from the nest to forage: most species of bee are known to travel less than two kilometres away. In order to ensure that these pollinators have sufficient areas of wild land within reach of their nests, agricultural landscapes need to be designed to accommodate the limited travelling distances of nesting pollinators. We used a spatially-explicit modelling approach to consider whether increasing the width of wild strips of land within the agricultural landscape will enhance the amount of wild resources available to a nesting pollinator, and if it would impact differently on pollinators with differing foraging strategies. This was done both by creating field structures with a randomised geography, and by using landscape data based upon the British agricultural landscape. These models demonstrate that enhancing field margins should lead to an increase in the availability of forage to pollinators that nest within the landscape. With the exception of species that only forage within a very short range of their nest (less than 125 m), a given amount of field margin manipulation should enhance the proportion of land available to a pollinator for foraging regardless of the distance over which it normally travels to find food. A fixed amount of field edge manipulation should therefore be equally beneficial for both longer-distance nesting foragers such as honeybees, and short-distance foragers such as solitary bees.",,,,"Rands, Sean/B-2243-2008","Rands, Sean/0000-0002-7400-005X; Whitney, Heather/0000-0001-6450-8266",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Oct-03,2011,6,10,,,,,,,e25971,10.1371/journal.pone.0025971,,,,,,,WOS:000295943000097,21991390,,,,

As previous studies carried out in Central Europe and the US have shown, bee diversity and abundance is influenced by the structure and the composition of the surrounding landscape. Comparable studies have so far not been carried out in the Mediterranean region. The present study examines the influence of Mediterranean landscape context on the diversity and abundance of wild bees. To do this, we sampled bees in 13 sites in olive groves on Lesvos Island, Greece. Bees were assigned to five categories consisting of three body size groups (small, medium and large bees), the single most abundant bee species (Lasioglossum marginatum) and all species combined. The influence of the landscape context on bee abundance and species richness was assessed at five radii (250, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 m) from the centre of each site. We found that the abundance within bee groups was influenced differently by different landscape parameters and land covers, whereas species richness was unaffected. Generally, smaller bees' abundance was impacted by landscape parameters at smaller scales and larger bees at larger scales. The land cover that influenced bee abundance positively was olive grove, while phrygana, conifer forest, broad-leaved forest, cultivated land, rock, urban areas and sea had mostly negative or no impact. We stress the need for a holistic approach, including all land covers, when assessing the effects of landscape context on bee diversity and abundance in the Mediterranean.",,,,"Petanidou, Theodora/C-9399-2011; Tscheulin, T./B-9722-2011; Settele, Josef/A-6371-2009","Petanidou, Theodora/0000-0003-1883-0945; Tscheulin, T./0000-0002-9901-1521; Settele, Josef/0000-0002-8624-4983",,,,,,,,,,,,0007-4853,,,,,OCT,2011,101,5,,,,,557,564,,10.1017/S0007485311000149,,,,,,,WOS:000295213800007,21457587,,,,

Negative effects on the biota are numerous, ranging from interruption of gene flow among populations, to the loss of genetic diversity within populations, to a decline in species richness over time. Orchid bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Euglossini) are of major conservation interest due to their function as pollinators of numerous orchid species and other tropical plants. Here, we used microsatellite markers to investigate the effects of geographic distance and habitat fragmentation on gene flow among populations. Populations of Euglossa dilemma in three geographic regions-the Yucatan peninsula (Mexico), Veracruz (Mexico), and Florida (USA)-were genetically structured predominantly across the regions, with the strength of differentiation among populations being positively correlated with geographic distance. Within geographic regions only little substructure was found, suggesting that dispersal is substantial in the absence of geographic or ecological barriers. In a second study, patterns of genetic differentiation among eight species of Euglossa were not related to habitat fragmentation following deforestation in southern Mexico (Veracruz). Specifically, most bee populations in the 9,800 ha forest remnant of Los Tuxtlas (Volcano San Martin) were neither differentiated from, nor had less genetic diversity than, populations in near-continuous forest separated from Los Tuxtlas by 130 km of agricultural land. Either occasional long distance dispersal across open areas has buffered the expected genetic effects of fragmentation, or the history of fragmentation in southern Mexico is too recent to have caused measurable shifts in allelic composition.",,,,"Moritz, Robin FA/K-6053-2012","Moritz, Robin FA/0000-0003-0791-887X; Eltz, Thomas/0000-0002-8465-7944",,,,,,,,,,,,1566-0621,1572-9737,,,,OCT,2011,12,5,,,,,1183,1194,,10.1007/s10592-011-0221-1,,,,,,,WOS:000294799600005,,,,,

We synthesised data from 29 studies with contrasting biomes, crop species and pollinator communities. Stability of flower-visitor richness, visitation rate (all insects except honey bees) and fruit set all decreased with distance from natural areas.

Inherited from the basic algorithm prototype, it involves parallel-operated global search and local search, which undertake exploration and exploitation, respectively. The innovation of this improved algorithm lies in the adaptive adjustment mechanism of the range of local search (called 'patch size') according to the source and the rate of change of the current optimum. Three gradually in-depth experiments are implemented for 143 kinds of soils. First, the two optimal STACV running parameters present the same increasing or decreasing trend with soil parameters. This result is consistent with the terramechanics-based theoretical analysis.

However, few studies have examined how much of the variance in tropical tree fecundity is explained by individual attributes of trees (e.g. number of flowers), and how much is due to contextual variables such as distances to nearest flowering neighbours. Using multiple regressions we examined the relative contributions of these factors to the pollination and fecundity of Goetzea elegans, a mainly self-incompatible tree endemic to Puerto Rico. We studied the largest wild population of the species during the peak flowering and collected data on the frequency of pollinator visits (N = 25 trees), and the fecundity of the whole population (N = 105), including the visitation rate of two pollinators (the honey bee Apis mellifera and the bananaquit Coereba flaveola), the total number of flowers produced by each tree, and the total fruit set and seed viability per tree. We also recorded the distance to flowering conspecifics and heterospecifics, and the height for each tree. Flower number had a strong positive effect on pollinator visitation, but distance to nearest neighbours was equally or more important than flower number in influencing fecundity. Also, competition for limited pollinators between G. elegans and other species has a stronger effect than the facilitation that conspecifics may provide.

It was unintentionally introduced to North America in the late 1960s from Europe, and subsequently, into South America, New Zealand and the Canary Islands. We provide information on the local distribution, seasonal abundance and sex ratio of A. manicatum from samples collected in an intensive two-year survey across Utah, USA. Anthidium manicatum was detected in 10 of the 29 Utah counties, largely in urban and suburban settings. Combining presence-only and MaxEnt background data from literature, museum databases and new records from Utah, we constructed three species distribution models to examine the potential distribution of A. manicatum in its native Eurasian range as well as invaded ranges of North and South America. The A. manicatum model based on locality and background data from the species' native range predicted 50% of the invasive records associated with high habitat suitability (HS >= 0.90). The invasive North American model predicted a much broader distribution of A. manicatum (214% increase); whereas, the South American model predicted a narrower distribution (88% decrease). The poor predictive power of the latter model in estimating suitable habitats in the invasive South American range of A. manicatum suggests that the bee may still be limited by the bioclimatic constraints associated with a novel environment. Estimates of niche similarity (D) between the native and invasive models find that the North America bioclimatic niche is more similar to the bioclimatic niche of the native model (D = 0.78), whereas the bioclimatic niche of the South America invasion is relatively dissimilar (D = 0.69).

To explore the interaction between variation in floral form and pollinator behavior, we observed the foraging behavior of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) when presented with both wild-type Mimulus lewisii plants and each of three chemically induced single-locus mutants with altered floral phenotypes, including loss of the three lower petals, loss of nectar guides, and a change in petal color patterning. We found that each of the mutants attracted successful pollinator visits at just 29-80% of the rate relative to wild-type flowers, suggesting that effective recruitment of bumblebee pollinators requires the landing platform provided by the lower petals, and visual cues provided by the nectar guides and petal color pattern.

We examined post-eclosion growth of three major muscles of the head capsule in major and minor workers of the ant Pheidole dentata using workers of different ages with distinct task repertoires. Mandible closer muscle fibers, which provide bite force and are thus critical for the use of the mandibles for biting and load carrying, fill the posterio-lateral portions of the head capsule in mature, older workers of both subcastes. Mandible closer fibers of newly eclosed workers, in contrast, are significantly thinner in both subcastes and grow during at least the next 6 days in minor workers, suggesting this muscle has reduced functionality for a substantial period of adult life and thus constrains task performance capability. Fibers of the antennal muscles and the pharynx dilator, which control antennal movements and food intake, respectively, also increase significantly in thickness with age. However, these fibers are only slightly thinner in newly eclosed workers and attain their maximum thickness over a shorter time span in minors. The different growth rates of these functionally distinct muscles likely have consequences for how adult P. dentata workers, particularly minors, develop their full and diverse task repertoire as they age. Workers may be capable of feeding and interacting socially soon after eclosion, but require a longer period of development to effectively use their mandibles, which enable the efficient performance of tasks ranging from nursing to foraging and defense.",,,,"Muscedere, Mario/A-6064-2011","Muscedere, Mario/0000-0002-4898-3961",,,,,,,,,,,,0028-1042,1432-1904,,,,SEP,2011,98,9,,,,,783,793,,10.1007/s00114-011-0828-6,,,,,,,WOS:000293969200008,21792597,,,,

Social females exhibited several reproductive strategies inferred from wing wear patterns, which reflect flight activity, and mandibular wear patterns, which reflect nest construction activity. Primary females accumulated a large degree of wing and mandibular wear and were presumed to be the primary reproductives in social nests. Secondary females accumulated less wing and mandibular wear and were probably subordinates awaiting opportunities to supersede primaries as dominant foragers and egg-layers.

Landmarks are used to chart a route or pinpoint a goal. The distant panorama, however, is often thought not to guide navigation directly during a familiar journey, but to act as a contextual cue that primes the correct memory of the landmarks. Results: We provided Melophorus bagoti ants with a huge artificial landmark located right near the nest entrance to find out whether navigating ants focus on such a prominent visual landmark for homing guidance. When the landmark was displaced by small or large distances, ant routes were affected differently. Certain behaviours appeared inconsistent with the hypothesis that guidance was based on the landmark only. Instead, comparisons of panoramic images recorded on the field, encompassing both landmark and distal panorama, could explain most aspects of the ant behaviours. Conclusion: Ants navigating along a familiar route do not focus on obvious landmarks or filter out distal panoramic cues, but appear to be guided by cues covering a large area of their panoramic visual field, including both landmarks and distal panorama. Using panoramic views seems an appropriate strategy to cope with the complexity of natural scenes and the poor resolution of insects' eyes. The ability to isolate landmarks from the rest of a scene may be beyond the capacity of animals that do not possess a dedicated object-perception visual stream like primates.",,,,,"Wystrach, Antoine/0000-0002-3273-7483; Cheng, Ken/0000-0002-4913-2691",,,,,,,,,,,,1742-9994,,,,,Aug-27,2011,8,,,,,,,,21,10.1186/1742-9994-8-21,,,,,,,WOS:000295469800001,21871114,,,,

Then, landmark vectors are used to localize the robotic agent in the environment and to choose the appropriate direction to return home.

Habitat degradation, destruction and fragmentation due to agricultural intensification have historically been the main causes of this pollinator decline. However, despite increasing and accelerating levels of global urbanization, very little research has investigated the effects of urbanization on pollinator assemblages. We assessed changes in the diversity, abundance and species composition of bee and hoverfly pollinator assemblages in urban, suburban, and rural sites across a UK city. Methodology/Principal Findings: Bees and hoverflies were trapped and netted at 24 sites of similar habitat character (churchyards and cemeteries) that varied in position along a gradient of urbanization. Local habitat quality (altitude, shelter from wind, diversity and abundance of flowers), and the broader-scale degree of urbanization (e. g. percentage of built landscape and gardens within 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, 1 km, and 2.5 km of the site) were assessed for each study site. The diversity and abundance of pollinators were both significantly negatively associated with higher levels of urbanization. Assemblage composition changed along the urbanization gradient with some species positively associated with urban and suburban land-use, but more species negatively so. Pollinator assemblages were positively affected by good site habitat quality, in particular the availability of flowering plants. Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that urban areas can support diverse pollinator assemblages, but that this capacity is strongly affected by local habitat quality. Nonetheless, in both urban and suburban areas of the city the assemblages had fewer individuals and lower diversity than similar rural habitats. The unique development histories of different urban areas, and the difficulty of assessing mobile pollinator assemblages in just part of their range, mean that complementary studies in different cities and urban habitats are required to discover if these findings are more widely applicable.",,,,"Fairbrass, Alison/K-6563-2016; Bates, Adam/G-1795-2011","Fairbrass, Alison/0000-0002-4907-9683; Hale, James/0000-0001-9662-1853; Matthews, Thomas/0000-0002-7624-244X; Sadler, Jonathan/0000-0003-0443-4458; Bates, Adam/0000-0001-7854-5260",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Aug-12,2011,6,8,,,,,,,e23459,10.1371/journal.pone.0023459,,,,,,,WOS:000293953500043,21858128,,,,

Here we examine the population structure of the bumblebee Bombus hortorum in a model island system, the Western Isles of Scotland, using microsatellite markers. Following declines in other species, B. hortorum is the only remaining long-tongued bumblebee species found in much of Europe, and thus it is of particular ecological importance. Our data suggest that populations of B. hortorum in western Scotland exist as distinct genetic clusters occupying groups of nearby islands. Population structuring was higher than for other bumblebee species which have previously been studied in this same island group (F-st = 0.16). Populations showed significant isolation by distance. This relationship was greatly improved by using circuit theory to allow dispersal rates to differ over different landscape features; as we would predict, sea appears to provide far higher resistance to dispersal than land. Incorporating bathymetry data improved the fit of the model further; populations separated by shallow seas are more genetically similar than those separated by deeper seas. We argue that this probably reflects events following the last ice age when the islands were first colonized by this bee species (8,500-5,000 ybp), when the sea levels were lower and islands separated by shallow channels would have been joined. In the absence of significant gene flow these genetic clusters appear to have since diverged over the following 5,000 years and arguably may now represent locally adapted races, some occurring on single islands.",,,,"Goulson, David/A-2462-2010; Lepais, Olivier/D-1849-2009","Goulson, David/0000-0003-4421-2876; Lepais, Olivier/0000-0002-6102-9478; Vallejo, Gillian/0000-0002-9995-3420",,,,,,,,,,,,1566-0621,1572-9737,,,,AUG,2011,12,4,,,,,867,879,,10.1007/s10592-011-0190-4,,,,,,,WOS:000292880800001,,,,,

K.; Thomson, James D.",,,An examination of synchrony between insect emergence and flowering in Rocky Mountain meadows,ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,,,,,,,,,,,,"One possible effect of climate change is the generation of a mismatch in the seasonal timing of interacting organisms, owing to species-specific shifts in phenology. Despite concerns that plants and pollinators might be at risk of such decoupling, there have been few attempts to test this hypothesis using detailed phenological data on insect emergence and flowering at the same localities. In particular, there are few data sets on pollinator flight seasons that are independent of flowering phenology, because pollinators are typically collected at flowers. To address this problem, we established standardized nesting habitat (trap nests) for solitary bees and wasps at sites along an elevational gradient in the Rocky Mountains, and monitored emergence during three growing seasons. We also recorded air temperatures and flowering phenology at each site. Using a reciprocal transplant experiment with nesting bees, we confirmed that local environmental conditions are the primary determinants of emergence phenology. We were then able to develop phenology models to describe timing of pollinator emergence or flowering, across all sites and years, as a function of accumulated degree-days. Although phenology of both plants and insects is well described by thermal models, the best models for insects suggest generally higher threshold temperatures for development or diapause termination than those required for plants. In addition, degree-day requirements for most species, both plants and insects, were lower in locations with longer winters, indicating either a chilling or vernalization requirement that is more completely fulfilled at colder sites, or a critical photoperiod before which degree-day accumulation does not contribute to development. Overall, these results suggest that phenology of plants and trap-nesting bees and wasps is regulated in similar ways by temperature, but that plants are more likely than insects to advance phenology in response to springtime warming. We discuss the implications of these results for plants and pollinators, and suggest that phenological decoupling alone is unlikely to threaten population persistence for most species in our study area.",,,,"Forrest, Jessica/A-6290-2010","Forrest, Jessica/0000-0002-5273-9339",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,,,AUG,2011,81,3,,,,,469,491,,10.1890/10-1885.1,,,,,,,WOS:000293457300005,,,,,

Individual cockroaches given a simultaneous choice in a Y-olfactometer between the odour of feeding conspecifics and the mixed odour of food plus non-feeding conspecifics showed a preference for the arm scented with the odour of feeding conspecifics.

While outcrossing levels have been described in crops such as rape that are wind-pollinated, or both wind- and insect-pollinated, much less is known about pollen dispersal in exclusively insect-pollinated crops. In this paper, we develop a mechanistic model for pollen movement that is based on a description of bee movement through space. Our model is a system of diffusion-based partial differential equations that we use to predict percent transgenic seed at arbitrary distances from a transgenic source under different planting scenarios. We present a two-pronged study, in which the mathematical modelling work is informed by experimental work. The latter was carried out in an apple orchard with a row of 200 transgenic source trees carrying the GUS marker gene. Fruit from neighbouring conventional trees was gathered at distances ranging from 3.5 m to 183 m, and the seeds were extracted and germinated. Percent transgenic seed at each location was determined by testing the seedlings for the presence of the GUS marker gene. We use the experimental data to validate and parameterize the model, and then run model simulations to determine expected percent transgenic seed in various linear landscapes. We find that the percent transgenic seed in neighbouring conventional trees and orchards is a function of the size of each orchard block and the distance between them. The model explicitly shows the effect of overlapping transgenic and nontransgenic pollen distributions in setting seed distributions, and also shows the value of buffer rows in reducing outcrossing levels in neighbouring crops. The model parameters can be adjusted to suit particular crops and locations, and may be useful for determining plausible distributions on transgenic seed plantings needed to allow for an adventitious presence of, for example, 0.9%.

We equip players with the particle swarm optimization technique, and find that it may lead to highly cooperative states even if the temptations to defect are strong. The concept of particle swarm optimization was originally introduced within a simple model of social dynamics that can describe the formation of a swarm, i.e., analogous to a swarm of bees searching for a food source. Essentially, particle swarm optimization foresees changes in the velocity profile of each player, such that the best locations are targeted and eventually occupied. In our case, each player keeps track of the highest payoff attained within a local topological neighborhood and its individual highest payoff. Thus, players make use of their own memory that keeps score of the most profitable strategy in previous actions, as well as use of the knowledge gained by the swarm as a whole, to find the best available strategy for themselves and the society. Following extensive simulations of this setup, we find a significant increase in the level of cooperation for a wide range of parameters, and also a full resolution of the prisoner's dilemma. We also demonstrate extreme efficiency of the optimization algorithm when dealing with environments that strongly favor the proliferation of defection, which in turn suggests that swarming could be an important phenomenon by means of which cooperation can be sustained even under highly unfavorable conditions.

Community composition and daily foraging patterns of bees visiting flowering urban T stalls resources were outlined and compared over a 21-month period from July 2007 to March 2009.

Centris eurypatana Snelling, Ancyloscelis sp. 1, and Nannotriogna perilampoides (Cresson) were the dominant species collected and accounted for nearly 75% of all records. Clear daily phenology was evident, with peak visitation occurring before 1300h. Common visitors can be sorted into early morning or full day foragers represented by Xylocopa and Halictus species, respectively.

While landscape context and habitat quality are known to influence species richness and abundance of bees, there is a lack of evidence from manipulative field experiments on bees' responses to adaptive management across differently structured landscapes. We present the results of a large-scale study that investigated the effects of a targeted agri-environment scheme (AES) on bumble bees (Bombus spp.) over three years in the United Kingdom. Forage patches of different sizes were sown with a conservation flower mixture across eight sites covering a broad range of agricultural land use types. Species richness and worker densities (especially of the longer-tongued Bombus species for which the mixture was targeted) were significantly higher on sown forage patches than on existing non-crop control habitats throughout the three-year study, but the strength of this response depended on both the proportions of arable land and abundance of herbaceous forb species in the surrounding landscape. The size of sown patches also affected worker density, with smaller patches (0.25 ha) attracting higher densities of some species than larger patches (1.0 ha). Our models show that a targeted AES can deliver greater net benefits in more intensively farmed areas, in terms of the number and species richness of bumble bees supported, than in heterogeneous landscapes where other foraging habitats exist. These findings serve to strengthen the evidence base for extending agri-environment schemes to boost declining pollinator populations to a larger number of agricultural landscapes across the globe.",,,,"Freeman, Stephen/E-7267-2012; Carvell, Claire/G-3168-2012; Bourke, Andrew/E-5271-2011; Pywell, Richard F/E-8738-2010; Heard, Matthew/E-6743-2012; Osborne, Juliet/I-6776-2012","Pywell, Richard F/0000-0001-6431-9959; ",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,,,,,JUL,2011,21,5,,,,,1760,1771,,,,,,,,,WOS:000292766100025,21830716,,,,

Alternatively, in some species, ICF was replaced by colony fission, in which young queens accompanied by workers found a new colony at walking distance from the mother nest. We compared the queen morphology of Cataglyphis floricola, which disperses by fission, with that of its most likely living ancestor, Cataglyphis emmae, which disperses by ICF. As in other species, the transition from ICF to fission is associated with queen miniaturization. Interestingly, C. floricola presents two types of small queens: brachypters (with short non-functional wings) and ergatoids (worker-like apterous queens). Ergatoids are, on average, 2.8 mg lighter and have half the number of ovarioles than brachypters, which limits the advantage for a colony to produce ergatoids instead of brachypters. Furthermore, more ergatoids are produced than brachypters, but their individual survival rate is lower. During colony fission, 96% of the cocoons containing brachypters but only 31% of those containing ergatoids are transferred to the daughter nests where, after emergence, they compete for becoming the next queen. The remaining queen cocoons, which stay in the mother queen's nest, are eliminated by workers upon emergence, probably to maintain monogyny. This waste of energy suggests that producing ergatoids instead of brachypters is unlikely to increase colony efficiency. We argue that the evolution of ergatoids could derive from a selfish larval strategy, developing into worker-like queens in spite of the colony interest.",,,,"Cerda, Xim/P-6461-2014; Boulay, Raphael/I-3735-2015","Cerda, Xim/0000-0002-3222-2471; Boulay, Raphael/0000-0002-0138-0856; Jowers, Michael J/0000-0001-8935-5913; Billen, Johan/0000-0002-2392-7293",,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,1432-0762,,,,JUL,2011,65,7,,,,,1473,1482,,10.1007/s00265-011-1157-7,,,,,,,WOS:000291654000013,,,,,

If patterns of genetic structure are determined largely by gene flow then they may be useful in predicting the likelihood of inbreeding or outbreeding depression but should be less useful if there is strong site-specific selection. For many Australian plants little is known about either their population genetics or the effects on mating systems of variation in pollen transfer distances. Experimental pollinations were used to compare the reproductive success of bird-adapted Grevillea mucronulata plants mated with individuals from a range of spatial scales. A hierarchical survey of microsatellite DNA variation was also conducted to describe the scale of population differentiation for neutral markers. Methods The effects of four pollen treatments on reproductive performance were compared. These treatments were characterized by transfer of pollen from (a) neighbouring adults; (b) an adjacent cluster of adults (30-50 m distant); (c) a distant cluster (>5 km distant); and (d) open pollination. Sets of 17.9 +/- 3.3 leaves from each of 15 clusters of plants were genotyped and spatial autocorrelation and F statistics were used to describe patterns of genetic structure. Key Results Grevillea mucronulata displayed evidence of both inbreeding and outbreeding depression, with 'intermediate' pollen producing consistently superior outcomes for most aspects of fitness including seed set, seed size, germination and seedling growth. Significant genotypic structuring was detected within clusters (spatial autocorrelation) and among adjacent clusters and clusters separated by >5 km distance (F(ST) = 0.07 and 0.10). Conclusions The superior outcome of intermediate pollen transfer and genetic differentiation of adjacent clusters suggests that G. mucronulata selection disfavours matings among closely and distantly related neighbours.

Shifts in the spatial and temporal patterns of flowering could affect the resources available to pollinators, and such shifts might become more common as climate change progresses. 2. As mid-summer temperatures have warmed, we found that a montane meadow ecosystem in the southern Rocky Mountains of the United States exhibits a trend toward a bimodal distribution of flower abundance, characterized by a mid-season reduction in total flower number, instead of a broad, unimodal flowering peak lasting most of the summer season. 3. We examined the shapes of community-level flowering curves in this system and found that the typical unimodal peak results from a pattern of complementary peaks in flowering among three distinct meadow types (dry, mesic and wet) within the larger ecosystem. However, high mid-summer temperatures were associated with divergent shifts in the flowering curves of these individual meadow types. Specifically, warmer summers appeared to cause increasing bimodality in mesic habitats, and a longer interval between early and late flowering peaks in wet and dry habitats. 4. Together, these habitat-specific shifts produced a longer mid-season valley in floral abundance across the larger ecosystem in warmer years. Because of these warming-induced changes in flowering patterns, and the significant increase in summer temperatures in our study area, there has been a trend toward non-normality of flowering curves over the period 1974-2009. This trend reflects increasing bimodality in total community-wide flowering. 5. The resulting longer periods of low flowering abundance in the middle of the summer season could negatively affect pollinators that are active throughout the season, and shifts in flowering peaks within habitats might create mismatches between floral resources and demand by pollinators with limited foraging ranges. 6. Synthesis. Early-season climate conditions are getting warmer and drier in the high altitudes of the southern Rocky Mountains. We present evidence that this climate change is disrupting flowering phenology within and among different moisture habitats in a sub-alpine meadow ecosystem, causing a mid-season decline in floral resources that might negatively affect mutualists, especially pollinators.

In the present study, spiders were trained to walk over a black-and-white grating and afterwards tested either over a white substratum, the same substratum used for training or the same substratum rotated 90deg (two groups: ALEs covered and only ALEs uncovered; they were tested first without their eyes covered and then with their eyes covered). The directional bearing was measured both in training and test conditions. Under the white or the same substratum in test conditions, the directional bearing had the same mean direction and a distribution similar to that of the training sessions. When the substratum was rotated 90deg, the directional bearing had the same mean direction but the distribution was significantly different from that of the training sessions. Moreover, if ALEs were covered, spiders behaved as if the substratum had not been rotated and the directional bearing distribution was similar to that of the training sessions. But, if ALEs were the only eyes uncovered, spiders behaved as if no eyes were covered and directional bearing distribution was similar to that of the test condition. It is suggested that, when homing, L. tarantula uses both idiothetic information and visual information gathered through ALEs.

There are evidences that air temperature and relative humidity exerts influence on the flight activity of the social stingless bees (Meliponini). Particularly, the relatively large species of Melipona Illiger, 1806 would present variation in daily foraging activity very close to variation in relative humidity. In this study, we argue that the relative humidity is a confounding variable. In this same line of argumentation, it was also examined the role of pollen harvest on daily rhythm of foraging. The robust Melipona scutellaris (Latreille, 1811) was used as a model and the flight activity and pollen harvest along the day were measured in 12 colonies (4 colonies/habitat), in three types of habitats with varying rainfall, within the natural distribution range of this species (tropical rainforest, seasonal tropical forest and transition of tropical forest-savannah). Most of flight activity occurs during morning time in the three habitats. Colony foraging is high in the very early morning when the relative humidity is also high, and often associated with peaks of pollen harvest. Flight activity decreases abruptly during the high temperatures around noon time. The relationship between the flight activity and the relative humidity was highly significant and linear, in contrast to the unimodal and significant relationship with temperature. The relationship between the flight activity and the relative humidity is assumed to be contingent within humid tropical habitats, considering the daily microclimate variation and pollen foraging patterns.

In this study, we analyzed the temporal variation in pollen dispersal and breeding structure in the Neotropical tree species Tabebuia aurea (Bignoniaceae) and evaluated pollen dispersal between a population inside the reserve and a patch of isolated individuals on the edge of the reserve, and tested the hypothesis that isolated individuals are sinking for pollen. All adult trees (260) within a population of 40 ha and 9 isolated individuals on the edge of the reserve were sampled, and from these adults, 21 open-pollinated progeny arrays were analyzed in 2 flowering seasons (309 seeds in 2004 and 328 in 2005). Genetic analyses were based on the polymorphism at 10 microsatellite loci. A high proportion of self-pollination found in both flowering seasons indicated a mixed-mating system. The mean pollen dispersal distance differed significantly between the two flowering seasons (307.78 m in 2004 and 396.26 m in 2005). Maximum pollen dispersal was 2608 m, but most pollination events (65%) occurred at distances <300 m. Our results also showed that isolated individuals are sinking for pollen, with high pollen flow between the population inside the reserve and individuals on the edge. These results are most likely due to the large pollinator species, which can potentially fly long distances, and also due to temporal variation in individual fecundity and contribution to pollen dispersal.

To date, both experimental data and models of oilseed rape (OSR) Brassica napus pollen movement at the landscape scale do not clearly differentiate between wind- and insect-mediated dispersal. Estimations of insect-mediated gene dispersal would be valuable for managing potential escapes of transgenes. 2. To quantify the intensity and spatial scale of pollen dispersal by insect pollinators in an agricultural landscape, bait points made of flowering male-sterile OSR that attract OSR pollinators were located at six distances (10-1100 m) from the closest OSR fields and feral populations. Flower-visiting insects were caught by net on these male-sterile flowers and were rubbed onto the stigmas of male-sterile OSR plants grown in a pollen-proof greenhouse to do a manual pollination of their flowers. In this way we were able to assess the insects' OSR pollen load and seed production at each of the six distances. 3. A large diversity of insects carried OSR pollen and contributed to seed production, but not pollen beetles Meligethes aeneus. Logistic regression analyses of the seed-set success from the manual pollination demonstrated that seed set significantly increased with the proximity of OSR fields, the size of the pollinating insect, and the main daily temperature. Seed set was not affected by the pollinating insect's order or genus. Seed set, both observed and predicted by the model, was above zero for flowers pollinated with large bees caught at > 1100 m from the nearest OSR field. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides clear evidence that a large variety of insect species can transfer viable pollen between OSR plants over considerable distances. However, only 39 center dot 4% of the insects caught on male-sterile flowers carried OSR pollen.

We installed pan traps to sample bees (i) on the grasslands; (ii) on grassland edges behind adjacent hedges (potential barriers) and without hedges; (iii) on grass strips in 100 m distance to the grassland, which were connected or unconnected to the grassland; and (iv) unconnected (isolated) grass strips in 300 m and 750 m distance to test for corridor and isolation effects on abundance and species richness of foraging wild bees.

Hedges did not confine movement of foraging bees. We found no mitigating effects of (100 m) corridor strips on any of the observed groups.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we report the first successful use of micro radio telemetry to track flight distances and space use of bumblebees. Using ground surveys and Cessna overflights in a Central European rural landscape mosaic we obtained maximum flight distances of 2.5 km, 1.9 km and 1.3 km for Bombus terrestris (workers), Bombus ruderatus (worker), and Bombus hortorum (young queens), respectively. Bumblebee individuals used large areas (0.25-43.53 ha) within one or a few days. Habitat analyses of one B. hortorum queen at the landscape scale indicated that gardens within villages were used more often than expected from habitat availability. Detailed movement trajectories of this individual revealed that prominent landscape structures (e. g. trees) and flower patches were repeatedly visited. However, we also observed long (i.e. >45 min) resting periods between flights (B. hortorum) and differences in flower-handling between bumblebees with and without transmitters (B. terrestris) suggesting that the current weight of transmitters (200 mg) may still impose significant energetic costs on the insects. Conclusions/Significance: Spatio-temporal movements of bumblebees can now be tracked with telemetry methods. Our measured flight distances exceed many previous estimates of bumblebee foraging ranges and suggest that travelling long distances to food resources may be common. However, even the smallest currently available transmitters still appear to compromise flower handling performance and cause an increase in resting behavior of bees. Future reductions of transmitter mass and size could open up new avenues for quantifying landscape-scale space use of insect pollinators and could provide novel insights into the behavior and requirements of bumblebees during critical life stages, e. g. when searching for mates, nest locations or hibernation sites.",,,,"Kissling, W.

Research has shown that they achieve this feat by memorizing landmarks and the skyline panorama, using the sun and polarized skylight as compasses and by integrating their outbound flight paths. In order to investigate the capacity of the honeybees' homing abilities, we artificially displaced foragers to novel release spots at various distances up to 13 km in the four cardinal directions. Returning bees were individually registered by a radio frequency identification (RFID) system at the hive entrance. We found that homing rate, homing speed and the maximum homing distance depend on the release direction. Bees released in the east were more likely to find their way back home, and returned faster than bees released in any other direction, due to the familiarity of global landmarks seen from the hive.

It has not yet been established, however, which specific parts of the optical flow field insects use to control their speed. With a view to answering this question, freely flying honeybees were trained to fly along a specially designed tunnel including two successive tapering parts: the first part was tapered in the vertical plane and the second one, in the horizontal plane. The honeybees were found to adjust their speed on the basis of the optic flow they perceived not only in the lateral and ventral parts of their visual field, but also in the dorsal part. More specifically, the honeybees' speed varied monotonically, depending on the minimum cross-section of the tunnel, regardless of whether the narrowing occurred in the horizontal or vertical plane. The honeybees' speed decreased or increased whenever the minimum cross-section decreased or increased. In other words, the larger sum of the two opposite optic flows in the horizontal and vertical planes was kept practically constant thanks to the speed control performed by the honeybees upon encountering a narrowing of the tunnel. The previously described ALIS (""AutopiLot using an Insect-based vision System'') model nicely matches the present behavioral findings. The ALIS model is based on a feedback control scheme that explains how honeybees may keep their speed proportional to the minimum local cross-section of a tunnel, based solely on optic flow processing, without any need for speedometers or rangefinders. The present behavioral findings suggest how flying insects may succeed in adjusting their speed in their complex foraging environments, while at the same time adjusting their distance not only from lateral and ventral objects but also from those located in their dorsal visual field.",,,,"Ruffier, Franck/G-4797-2013","Ruffier, Franck/0000-0002-7854-1275",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,May-12,2011,6,5,,,,,,,e19486,10.1371/journal.pone.0019486,,,,,,,WOS:000290531100013,21589861,,,,

Here, we evaluate how fluctuations in grass seed abundance during three consecutive growing seasons influenced the foraging behaviour and diet of the harvester ants Pogonomyrmex rastratus, P. mendozanus and P. inermis in the central Monte desert, Argentina. Seed abundance of the most consumed grasses varied greatly through ant activity season, and ants altered their foraging behaviour in response to those changes. Foragers spent more time travelling and searching for food, and their foraging trips took longer during the low seed availability season. Foraging distance was very similar among species and, contrary to our expectations, did not vary between seasons. Foraging success of P. rastratus and P. inermis increased during the high availability season. This matched the seasonal pattern of foraging activity, suggesting that colonies may detect seed abundance and regulate their foraging effort with the rate of forager success. Although grass seeds were the main item in the diet of the three species, P. mendozanus, and to a lesser extent P. rastratus, turned more generalist when grass seeds were scarce. In contrast, P. inermis showed a very narrow diet breadth, only harvesting grass seeds in both seasons. Our results indicate the relevance of seed availability on foraging behaviour of harvester ants, which should be taken into account when predicting and evaluating the effect of ants on seed resources as well as numerical responses of harvester ant populations to the temporal and spatial variations in grass seed abundance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1442-9985,,,,,MAY,2011,36,3,,,,,320,328,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02153.x,,,,,,,WOS:000289952500011,,,,,

We ask whether bee and fly pollinator taxa differ in their dispersal distances and transport of viable pollen in a human-modified system. Location Canterbury and Otago region, South Island, New Zealand. Methods We captured pollen-carrying insects travelling outside of a model mass-flowering agricultural crop, Brassica rapa, using insect flight intercept traps at five distances (0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 m) from the pollen source. We examined pollen loads and pollen viability to determine whether pollen transport distance and viability differ among pollinator taxa. Results A total of 5453 insects were collected of which 717 individuals from 26 insect taxa were positively identified as dispersing pollen up to 400 m from the source. These taxa consisted of four species from two bee families (Hymenoptera: Apidae and Halictidae), and eight species from four fly families (Diptera: Bibiondae, Stratiomyidae, Syrphidae and Tachinidae). Apidae generally carried higher pollen loads and more viable pollen than most fly taxa. Taxa in the fly families Stratiomyidae and Syrphidae, however, carried pollen to 400 m, which is further than both bee families. Main conclusions A diverse array of wild and managed flower visitors can transport viable pollen from a pollen source to at least 400 m. Knowledge of the differences in transport distances among generalist pollinators in human-modified environments is crucial to understand the potential extent to which (1) pollen transport can facilitate gene flow and (2) unwanted hybridization may occur between crops and related weeds.",,,,"Howlett, Brad/F-1150-2018; Cunningham, Saul A/B-9947-2009; Rader, Romina/A-1054-2012; Westcott, David A/G-5559-2010; Rader, Romina/X-6428-2019","Howlett, Brad/0000-0002-0694-135X; Cunningham, Saul A/0000-0003-0703-6893; Rader, Romina/0000-0001-9056-9118; Edwards, Will/0000-0001-8981-7479",,,,,,,,,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,,,MAY,2011,17,3,,,,,519,529,,10.1111/j.1472-4642.2011.00757.x,,,,,,,WOS:000289259300012,,,,,

Since forager distribution can be difficult to measure directly, mathematical models are often used to predict the population density of dispersing foragers on the landscape. We model organism movement using a diffusion framework in which the foraging population is divided into two subpopulations engaged in intensive and extensive search modes respectively. Movement in the intensive search mode (ISM) is modeled by diffusion, and movement in the extensive search mode (ESM) is modeled by advection. We show that our model provides a superior fit to organism movement data than more traditional diffusion or diffusion-advection models in which the forager population is considered homogeneous.

Controversy exists not only about the structure of spatial memory but also about the efficiency of dance communication [2-5]. Some of these uncertainties were resolved by studies in which recruits' flights were monitored using harmonic radar [6, 7]. We asked whether the two sources of vector information-the previously learned flight vector to a food source and the communicated vector-are represented in a common frame of spatial reference. We found that recruits redirect their outbound flights and perform novel shortcut flights between the communicated and learned locations in both directions. Guidance by beacons at the respective locations or by the panorama of the horizon was excluded. These findings indicate a spatial reference based on either large-scale vector integration or a common geocentric map-like spatial memory.

We previously used a novel immediate early gene, termed kakusei, to demonstrate that the neural activity of a specific mushroom body (MB) neuron subtype is preferentially enhanced in the forager brain. The sensory information related to this MB neuron activity, however, remained unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we used kakusei to analyze the relationship between MB neuron activity and types of foraging behavior. The number of kakusei-positive MB neurons was higher in the round dancers that had flown a short distance than in the waggle dancers that had flown a long distance. Furthermore, the amount of kakusei transcript in the MBs inversely related to the waggle-phase duration of the waggle dance, which correlates with the flight distance. Using a narrow tunnel whose inside was vertically or axially lined, we manipulated the pattern of visual input, which is received by the foragers during flight, and analysed kakusei expression. The amount of kakusei transcript in the MBs was related to the foraging frequency but not to the tunnel pattern. In contrast, the number of kakusei-positive MB neurons was affected by the tunnel patterns, but not related to foraging frequency. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that the MB neuron activity depends on the foraging frequency, whereas the number of active MB neurons is related to the pattern of visual input received during foraging flight.

Studies on the role of visual memories have suggested that bees approach the goal by finding a close match between their current view and a memorized view of the goal location. The most relevant landmark features for this matching process seem to be their retinal positions, the size as defined by their edges, and their color. Recently, we showed that honeybees can use landmarks that are statically camouflaged, suggesting that motion cues are relevant as well. Currently it is unclear how bees weight these different landmark features when accomplishing navigational tasks, and whether this depends on their saliency. Since natural objects are often distinguished by their texture, we investigate the behavioral relevance and the interplay of the spatial configuration and the texture of landmarks. We show that landmark texture is a feature that bees memorize, and being given the opportunity to identify landmarks by their texture improves the bees' navigational performance. Landmark texture is weighted more strongly than landmark configuration when it provides the bees with positional information and when the texture is salient.

Depending on the content, design and the original function of the cue, there are predictable ways that selection can enhance the communicative function of chemicals. We review recent progress on how efficacy-based selection by receivers leads to distinct evolutionary trajectories of chemical communication. Because the original function of a cue may channel but also constrain the evolution of functional communication, we show that a broad perspective on multiple selective pressures acting upon chemicals provides important insights into the origin and dynamic evolution of chemical information transfer.

We determined whether foraging is improved in part because patriline diversity generates more responsive populations of scouting foragers. Scouts search for new food sources and advertise them with waggle dances to inform other foragers about unexploited discoveries. We moved multiple-patriline and single-patriline colonies to unfamiliar locations so that colonies relied heavily on successful scouts to initiate recruitment and then compared the development of foraging effort between the two types of colonies. More waggle dance signals were produced during the incipient stages of foraging in multiple-patriline colonies compared to single-patriline colonies because scouts reported food discoveries with longer dances. Scouts also returned to multiple-patriline colonies at rates that were two thirds higher than those of single-patriline colonies, although return rates for general forager populations were not significantly different between colony types. The distance of reported food sources from hives increased with time for all colonies, but by the end of their first day in an unfamiliar environment, maximal foraging reach was greater if colonies had multiple patrilines. Most scouts in multiple-patriline colonies came from a minority of scout-rich patrilines that were generally not those from which general forager populations were derived; the presence of such scout-rich patrilines was correlated with the extent of recruitment signaling in colonies.

In particular, the size of visitors, relative to flower size, may have severe implications for plant fitness, as it can affect the mechanics of the pollination process. Ononis masquillierii, a rare endemic legume in northern Italy, is visited by numerous bee species of different families and sizes. To evaluate the effect of bee guilds on seed set, we compared the relative efficiency of four size classes of bees visiting flowers in eight plant populations occurring in the Apennines. Size classes were assorted by body weight. Reproductive success was positively related to plant population size and affected by the visitation frequency of the bee size guilds: higher visitation rates by larger bees (medium-large Andrenidae and large Apidae) increased seed set, whereas high visitation rates by smaller bees (small Halictidae and small-medium Megachilidae) reduced seed set. We conclude that the influence of bee size on seed set is related to the pollen foraging techniques of the different bee guilds. Larger bees paying short visits to flowers remove one 'batch' of pollen and transfer it to another flower. In contrast, smaller bees enter the flower entirely and activate the pump-like pollen dispensing mechanism several times, resulting in a higher degree of selfing. These behaviours may result in differential seed sets as the flowers are self-incompatible, i.e. seed set may be reduced after visitation by smaller bees. Such variations in pollinator quality among populations coupled with the ephemeral nature of the habitat of O. masquillierii may represent a risk for its persistence. Our results show that such a risk can be confronted only through the conservation of large plant populations and of large bees capable of flying long-distances.

For organisms living in highly structured groups of related individuals, such as colonies of social insects, personalities could also emerge at the group level. However, while numerous recent studies have investigated individual-level personality, the phenomenon of collective personality in animal groups has received little attention. In this paper, we apply the concept of collective personality to colonies of honeybees (Apis mellifera). We document the presence of consistent differences among colonies across a wide range of collective behaviours and demonstrate a link between colony-level personality traits and fitness. The colonies in our study showed consistent behavioural differences in traits such as defensive response, foraging activity and undertaking, and several of these traits were correlated as part of a behavioural syndrome. Furthermore, some of these traits were strongly tied to colony productivity and winter survival. Our results show that the concept of collective personality is applicable to colonies of social insects, and that personality differences among colonies can have important consequences for their long-term survival and reproduction. Applying the concept of personality to close-knit animal groups can provide important insights into the structure of behavioural variability in animal populations and the role that consistent between-group behavioural differences play in the evolution of behaviour.

Effective population size of bumblebees is determined by nest density, so the ability to quantify nest density would greatly aid conservation work. We describe the training and testing of a dog to find bumblebee nests. The dog was trained by the British army, using B. terrestris nest material. Its efficacy in finding buried nest material of a range of bumblebee species was 100%, and no false positives were recorded, suggesting that the dog was able to generalize across Bombus species. The dog was then used to locate bumblebee nests in four different habitats on the island of Tiree, west Scotland.

This realization emphasizes the need for assessment and quantification of biological effects of radiation on living organisms. Here we report the results of an environmental analysis based on extensive censuses of abundance of nine animal taxa (spiders, dragonflies, grasshoppers, bumblebees, butterflies, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) around Chernobyl in Ukraine and Belarus during 2006-2009. Background levels of radiation explained 1.5-26.5% of the variance in abundance of these nine taxa, birds and mammals having the strongest effects, accounting for a difference of a factor 18 among taxa. These effects were retained in analyses that accounted for potentially confounding effects. Effect size estimated as the amount of variance in abundance explained by background level of radiation was highly consistent among years, with weaker effects in years with low density. Effect sizes were greater in taxa with longer natal dispersal distances and in taxa with higher population density. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that costs of dispersal (i.e. survival) were accentuated under conditions of radioactive contamination, or that high density allowed detection of radiation effects. This suggests that standard breeding bird censuses can be used as an informative bio-indicator for the effects of radiation on abundance of animals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Cruse, H; Wehner, R",,,,"Cruse, Holk; Wehner, Ruediger",,,No Need for a Cognitive Map: Decentralized Memory for Insect Navigation,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"In many animals the ability to navigate over long distances is an important prerequisite for foraging. For example, it is widely accepted that desert ants and honey bees, but also mammals, use path integration for finding the way back to their home site. It is however a matter of a long standing debate whether animals in addition are able to acquire and use so called cognitive maps. Such a 'map', a global spatial representation of the foraging area, is generally assumed to allow the animal to find shortcuts between two sites although the direct connection has never been travelled before. Using the artificial neural network approach, here we develop an artificial memory system which is based on path integration and various landmark guidance mechanisms ( a bank of individual and independent landmark-defined memory elements). Activation of the individual memory elements depends on a separate motivation network and an, in part, asymmetrical lateral inhibition network. The information concerning the absolute position of the agent is present, but resides in a separate memory that can only be used by the path integration subsystem to control the behaviour, but cannot be used for computational purposes with other memory elements of the system. Thus, in this simulation there is no neural basis of a cognitive map. Nevertheless, an agent controlled by this network is able to accomplish various navigational tasks known from ants and bees and often discussed as being dependent on a cognitive map. For example, map-like behaviour as observed in honey bees arises as an emergent property from a decentralized system. This behaviour thus can be explained without referring to the assumption that a cognitive map, a coherent representation of foraging space, must exist. We hypothesize that the proposed network essentially resides in the mushroom bodies of the insect brain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,MAR,2011,7,3,,,,,,,e1002009,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002009,,,,,,,WOS:000288995500029,21445233,,,,

Although bees are the most important pollinators, they are endangered by intensive agricultural practices. The present study investigated the effects of farmland management and environmental factors at local and landscape scales on bees in Central Hungary. Bees were sampled in winter cereal fields that varied in the amount of applied fertilizer and insecticide use. Measurements included total, small and large bee species richness and abundance; stability of total species richness and abundance (coefficient of variation, CV); the nitrogen content of fertilizers; the number of insecticide applications; within-field location; species richness and abundance of insect-pollinated plants; and the percentage of semi-natural areas in a 500-m radius circle around the fields under study. Increasing the amount of fertilizer decreased total and small bee abundance and increased the CV of total bee abundance. Insecticide use had a significant negative effect on total and small bee species richness and on large bee abundance. The percentage of semi-natural habitats in a 500-m radius did not influence bee species richness and abundance. The results obtained confirms that the intensification of farmland management poses a threat to bee diversity, and thus may reduce pollination services.

Location Twenty islands in the Kepulauan Seribu Archipelago off the coast of west Java, Indonesia. The size of surveyed islands ranges between 0.75 and 41.32 ha; their distance from the coast of Java varies between 3 and 62 km. Methods Field work was conducted from February to May 2005. Bees and wasps were caught with a sweep net during sampling units of 15 min, continuing until four consecutive samples revealed no new species. Total species richness was quantified by the estimators Chao 2, first-order jackknife and Michaelis-Menten. The software binmatnest was used to test for nestedness of species assemblages. Similarities of species composition between islands were quantified by S circle divide rensen's similarity index. Results Eighty-two species were recorded on the 20 surveyed islands. Species richness declined with increasing isolation of islands from the source area, Java. Although the size of the largest island exceeded that of the smallest island by a factor of almost 60, island size only very weakly affected species richness of bees; no effect of island size was found for wasps. Mean body size of species decreased with increasing island isolation. Nestedness of island faunas was only weakly developed. Species composition of both superfamilies was affected by island isolation, but not by island size. Main conclusions While the species-isolation relationship on the very small islands of Kepulauan Seribu followed the prediction of MacArthur and Wilson's equilibrium theory, the absence of a species-area relationship indicated a weak 'small-island effect', at least in wasps. The combination of an only weakly developed pattern of nested species subsets, the shift in species compositions and the decline of mean body size with increasing island isolation from the source area indicates that biotic interactions and different species traits contribute to the shaping of communities of bees and wasps within the archipelago. The potential of biotic interactions for generating distribution patterns of species within the archipelago is also emphasized by the observed restriction of some species with apparently high dispersal abilities to outer islands.",,,,"Buchori, Damayanti/L-5878-2017","Buchori, Damayanti/0000-0002-2843-0737",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,,,,,FEB,2011,38,2,,,,,247,258,,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2010.02395.x,,,,,,,WOS:000286328200003,,,,,

Honey bees are a classic example and maintain their thoracic muscles at temperatures (T-th) tuned to the caloric benefits of floral resources. Using infrared thermography, we tested the hypothesis that forager motivation to recruit nestmates for a food source is positively correlated with T-th. We trained bees to a sucrose feeder located 5-100m from the nest. Recruiting foragers had a significantly higher average T-th (2.7 degrees C higher) when returning from 2.5mol l(-1) sucrose (65% w/w) than when returning from 1.0mol l(-1) sucrose (31% w/w). Foragers exhibited significantly larger thermal fluctuations the longer they spent inside the nest between foraging trips. The difference between maximum and minimum temperatures during a nest visit (T-range) increased with total duration of the nest visit (0.7 degrees C increase per additional min spent inside the nest). Bees that recruited nestmates (waggle or round danced) were significantly warmer, with a 1.4-1.5 times higher Delta T-th (difference between T-th and nest ambient air temperature) than bees who tremble danced or simply walked on the nest floor without recruiting between foraging bouts. However, recruiter T-th was not correlated with finer-scale measures of motivation: the number of waggle dance circuits or waggle dance return phase duration. These results support the hypothesis that forager T-th within the nest is correlated to broad-scale differences in foraging motivation.",,,,"Nieh, James/H-8705-2014","Nieh, James/0000-0001-6237-0726",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,FEB,2011,214,3,,,,,469,475,,10.1242/jeb.049445,,,,,,,WOS:000286807900021,21228206,,,,

The local abundance of bumblebee species was studied in 22 semi-natural meadows located in Northeast Estonia. The proportion of forest cover and brushwood cover, the mean patch area of forest and the edge density of forest were calculated at four spatial scales (i.e., radii of 250 in, 500 m, 1000 m and 2000 in). In total, we found 597 individuals of bumblebees belonging to 24 species (gen. Sambas), including five species of cuckoo bumblebees (subgen. Psithyrus). Our study shows that some bumblebee species seem to have different preferences in terms of the structure of the landscape. Some species may benefit from a heterogeneous landscape with a high proportion of forest habitats (e.g., B. schrencki), whereas others seem to prefer open areas (e.g., B. veteranus). We also found that some bumblebee species that have large foraging distances (e.g., B. terrestris) seem to be negatively affected by forest, as the presence of a high quantity of forest patches in the surrounding landscape could narrow their foraging area. The joint effects of the set of landscape variables related with forests appear to be important for some bumblebee species, specially, but not only, at the largest spatial scale. Overall, our results indicate that the presence of forest is very important for bumblebees, even for some species that prefer open areas, as forest habitats and edges may offer overwintering sites and nesting places for them. In countries like Estonia, where forests are widely distributed and represent a relevant part of the landscape mosaic, this type of habitat should be preserved if conservation of biodiversity is desired. In addition, conservation efforts targeting particular species of bumblebees should consider the landscape preferences of the species under study, and these efforts should aim to maintain the habitat types that are suitable for most bumblebee species.",,,,"Kaart, Tanel/I-2349-2018","Kaart, Tanel/0000-0002-8936-768X",,,,,,,,,,,,1392-1355,,,,,,2011,17,2,,,,,235,242,,,,,,,,,WOS:000302278100008,,,,,

Deserts are especially sensitive to such effects due to generally low nutrient levels and water availability. Gardens in human settlements in the desert are often a main source of alien plant species that provide ample foraging resources year round. These changes in floral composition and availability may alter pollinator community composition and foraging behaviour, as well as pollination network characteristics. We investigated the effects of desert gardening on pollinator communities and pollination networks in the Jordan Rift Valley (Israel), an arid agro-natural landscape south of the Dead Sea. We studied seasonal diversity patterns of plants and wild bees in natural habitats and in gardens in settlements. Wild bees and blooming plants were sampled from February to July in 2007 and in 2008. We constructed plant pollinator networks and compared bee communities between the two habitat types along the season. We found that bee abundance was greater in the gardens, and that rarefied bee species richness was greater in the natural habitat. Bee species richness and abundance exhibited contrasting seasonal patterns between habitats. Bee community composition also differed greatly between habitats, and species in the gardens had a generally wider geographical range in comparison to species in the natural habitat. We also found a higher level of generalisation of the pollination network in the gardens compared to the natural habitat, which may indicate a response to a disturbed and unstable environment. We conclude that gardening in deserts although promoting overall bee abundance, negatively affects species richness and changes community composition and network characteristics, with possible implications on the composition of native flora in the natural habitat surrounding the gardens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1439-1791,1618-0089,,,,,2011,12,4,,,,,310,320,,10.1016/j.baae.2010.12.003,,,,,,,WOS:000293312600005,,,,,

We investigated plant pollinator interactions in urban vegetation communities in the context of local community structure and two landscape metrics describing the surrounding urban matrix. We recorded plant species diversity, floral density, pollinator species and floral visits at 89 flowering patches within the urban matrix, and used Trifolium pratense as a focal plant species. We correlated visits by all species, by bees, by bees when excluding the main visitor Bombus pascuorum, and by the main visitor alone T. pratense with the landscape metrics ""green area"", representing the total extent of vegetated areas, and ""edge density of green areas"", representing the degree of habitat fragmentation, at scales from 20 to 200 m. Extent of green area was positively correlated with visits by all species, by bees, and by Bombus pascuorum, but negatively with bees excluding the main visitor. The correlation increased with scale for all four variables, and the strongest correlations were found for B. pascuorum. The direction of correlation between edge density and the visitation variables was similar as for green area, but showed considerable variation at scales below 100 m radius. Visits by all bees and all visitors to T. pratense were negatively affected by flowering plant species diversity. There was a positive interaction between extent of green area and plant diversity on bee visitation, and a negative interaction between the extent of green area and heterospecific flowers for bees (excluding B. pascuorum). Increasing floral abundance and plant diversity reduced pollinator visitation to T. pro tense, suggesting competitive effects through both quantity and diversity of resources. Competition for flower visitors was mainly from Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens, both of which frequently co-occurred with T. pratense. We conclude that T. pratense competes for pollinators with other co-occurring plants, but that the nature of the surrounding urban matrix mediates interactions among plant species for pollinator services at different scales, particularly with respect to the proportion of green areas.

The Great Basin's mountainous landscape provides an ideal setting to compare the interaction of landscape and dispersal ability in isolating populations of different species. Methods : We used eight highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to identify neutral population genetic structure between populations within and among mountain ranges for eight populations of P. deustus, 10 populations of P. pachyphyllus, and 10 populations of P. rostriflorus. We applied traditional population genetics approaches as well as spatial and landscape genetics approaches to infer genetic structure and discontinuities among populations.

M. jenseni is a cleptoparasite of Centris species. Centris species are oil-collecting bees and showed territorial behaviour (i.e. they always visited a restricted group of plants which they protected from other visitors), they visited several flowers/plants, which enhanced geitonogamous self-pollination and reduced pollination efficiency, and which might explain the low natural fruit set observed in M. aphylla. C. vardyorum was the most important pollinator of M. aphylla in the study area. The reproductive biology of M. aphylla differs along its distributional range.

The flowers are pollinated by Xylocopa spp bees, and seeds are dispersed by mammals with distinct home range sizes. As a consequence, relative contributions of pollen and seeds to overall gene flow can vary according to different spatial scales. We studied the genetic structure of four natural populations of S. lycocarpum separated by 19 to 128 km, including individuals located along dirt roads that interlink three of the populations. A total of 294 individuals were genotyped with five nuclear and six chloroplast microsatellite markers. Significant spatial genetic structure was found in the total set of individuals; the Sp statistic was 0.0086. Population differentiation based on the six chloroplast microsatellite markers (theta(pC) = 0.042) was small and similar to that based on the five nuclear microsatellite markers (theta(p) = 0.054).

Flower visitation frequency and foraging behavior differed between queen bumblebees and workers. Queens exhibited less frequent flower visits, longer flight distances between inflorescences, and a smaller number of sequential inflorescence visits within patches than did worker bees. Flowering in early-snowmelt populations occurred in June, when only overwintered queens were available, while flowering in late-snowmelt populations occurred from late July to August, when frequent visits by workers were common. The fruit to flower ratio per inflorescence was lower in early-snowmelt populations due to quantitative pollen limitation, while the seed to ovule ratio per fruit was lower in late-snowmelt populations. This is because geitonogamous pollination by workers was common later in the season, which resulted in a high abortion rate of self-pollinated seeds, that is, qualitative pollen limitation. Thus, pollination efficiency, or the type of pollen limitation, shifts during the flowering season, reflecting the seasonal life cycle of bumblebees in the ecosystem. Many of the self-fertilized seeds aborted due to high inbreeding depression, and the outcrossing rate was similar to 80% regardless of season.",,,,"Kudo, Gaku/A-2733-2015; Hirao, Akira/AAF-9630-2020; Kawai, Yuka/K-2984-2019; Hirao, Akira S./AAF-1177-2020; KAWAI, YUKA/A-3417-2012","Kudo, Gaku/0000-0002-6488-818X; Hirao, Akira S./0000-0001-6707-7369; ",,,,,,,,,,,,1058-5893,,,,,JAN,2011,172,1,,,,,70,77,,10.1086/657282,,,,,,,WOS:000286381100005,,,,,

Plant-insect interactions in particular might become disrupted due to species-specific responses of plants and insects towards these changes. We investigated how environmental change affects flower visitation and pollination with a field study simulating pollinator habitat loss (distance to semi-natural habitat), phenological shift (anticipated flowering) and environmentally induced growth (enhanced flower height). We established 16 habitat islands of potted plants of Sinapis arvensis L., recorded all flower visitors (mainly bees, flies and pollen beetles) and quantified the seed set. Experimentally elevated flowers were less often visited by flies, while visitation by bees was not affected. Further, plants distant from calcareous grassland were less often visited by bees but visitation by flies did not decrease. Anticipated flowering reduced the number of both pollinators and herbivorous pollen beetles and increased the reproductive success (seeds per plant) of S. arvensis, showing that the loss of mutualists was compensated by an escape from antagonists. During the natural flowering period more seeds were produced close to grasslands, especially by plants of natural height, presumably due to the higher bee visitation rate. However, seed production appeared to be relatively tolerant to multiple environmental changes due to complementary patterns among the different flower visitor guilds. Our results suggest complex interactions of environmental change with responses of mutualists and antagonists, making general predictions difficult. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

The minimum flight temperatures for L. hoozana ranged from 11 degrees C to 16 degrees C, and were higher than the minimum flight temperatures of 8 degrees C to 10 degrees C for A. cerana.

The highly complex social organization of honeybees is mediated through pheromones. Releaser pheromones cause rapid changes in the behaviour of the recipient, while primer pheromones have relatively slow and long-term effects on the physiology and behaviour of the recipient. Queen retinue pheromone (QRP) is a blend of the nine compounds (9-oxo-(E)-2-decenoic acid, (R)and (S)-9-hydroxy-(E)-2-decenoic acid, methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, 4-hydroxy-3-methyoxyphenylethanol, methyl oleate, coniferyl alcohol, palmityl alcohol, and linolenic acid) and acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting worker bees to the queen. QRP also acts as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting the ovary development of worker bees. An essential component of QRP, 9-oxo-(E)-2-decenoic acid, acts as a long-distance sex pheromone. Defensive behaviour of honeybees is induced and modulated by alarm pheromones. The essential alarm pheromone component is isopentyl acetate (IPA). The unsaturated derivative of IPA, 3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl acetate, was found in colonies of Africanized honeybees. The Nasanov gland of worker bees produces a pheromone (a blend of nerol, geraniol, (E)- and (Z)-citral, nerolic acid, geranic acid and (E, E)-farnesol) that acts as an attracting signal. This pheromone is used for aggregation (during swarming). Adult worker bees also produce a substance, ethyl oleate, that has a priming effect. Ethyl oleate is produced by adult forager bees and acts as a chemical inhibitory factor to delay age at onset of foraging (the presence of older worker bees causes a delayed onset of foraging in younger individuals). Chemical cues on the surface of larvae called a brood pheromone (ethyl and methyl esters of palmitic, linoleic, linolenic, stearic, and oleic acids, E-beta-ocimene) are important in the communication between brood and worker bees. This pheromone modulates the feeding behaviour of worker bees, inhibits the activation of the worker ovary, induces worker bees to cap brood cells, increases the activity of the hypopharyngeal glands of nurse bees and modulates the behavioural maturation of worker bees.",,,,"Rajchard, Josef/D-8518-2016","Rajchard, Josef/0000-0002-5217-0154",,,,,,,,,,,,0375-8427,1805-9392,,,,,2011,56,6,,,,,265,273,,10.17221/1543-VETMED,,,,,,,WOS:000293892700001,,,,,

Among honey bee pathogens, RNA viruses are emerging as a serious threat and are suspected as major contributors to CCD. Recent detection of these viral species in bumble bees suggests a possible wider environmental spread of these viruses with potential broader impact. It is therefore vital to study the ecology and epidemiology of these viruses in the hymenopteran pollinator community as a whole. We studied the viral distribution in honey bees, in their pollen loads, and in other non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators collected from flowering plants in Pennsylvania, New York, and Illinois in the United States. Viruses in the samples were detected using reverse transcriptase-PCR and confirmed by sequencing. For the first time, we report the molecular detection of picorna-like RNA viruses (deformed wing virus, sacbrood virus and black queen cell virus) in pollen pellets collected directly from forager bees. Pollen pellets from several uninfected forager bees were detected with virus, indicating that pollen itself may harbor viruses. The viruses in the pollen and honey stored in the hive were demonstrated to be infective, with the queen becoming infected and laying infected eggs after these virus-contaminated foods were given to virus-free colonies. These viruses were detected in eleven other non-Apis hymenopteran species, ranging from many solitary bees to bumble bees and wasps. This finding further expands the viral host range and implies a possible deeper impact on the health of our ecosystem. Phylogenetic analyses support that these viruses are disseminating freely among the pollinators via the flower pollen itself. Notably, in cases where honey bee apiaries affected by CCD harbored honey bees with Israeli Acute Paralysis virus (IAPV), nearby non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators also had IAPV, while those near apiaries without IAPV did not. In containment greenhouse experiments, IAPV moved from infected honey bees to bumble bees and from infected bumble bees to honey bees within a week, demonstrating that the viruses could be transmitted from one species to another. This study adds to our present understanding of virus epidemiology and may help explain bee disease patterns and pollinator population decline in general.",,,,"dePamphilis, Claude W/P-6652-2016; Holmes, Edward/Y-2789-2019; Toth, Amy L/A-9196-2011; vanEngelsdorp, Dennis/E-7934-2010","Holmes, Edward/0000-0001-9596-3552; Lipkin, W.

The genetic effect of habitat fragmentation depends largely on the level of gene flow within and among population fragments. In the present study, Eurycorymbus cavaleriei, a canopy tree found throughout subtropical China, was selected as a representative insect-pollinated plant species to assess genetic consequence of forest fragmentation. Contemporary pollen dispersal and mating patterns were estimated in two physically isolated stands of E. cavaleriei within fragmented forests using six highly polymorphic microsatellite loci. We found high genetic diversity (H-E = 0.670-0.754) in both adults and offspring in the fragmented agricultural landscape, suggesting that habitat fragmentation did not necessarily erode genetic diversity of E. cavaleriei. Although substantial pollen travelled less than 100 m, paternity analysis revealed that a large amount of long-distance pollination events occurred, with the average pollen dispersal distance being 1107m and 325m for the two stands, respectively. Extensive pollen immigration (39.3-42.6%) indicated that there was effective genetic connectivity among E. cavaleriei stands in the fragmented forests. TWOGENER analysis revealed that the exponential power model was the best-fitting dispersal curve with a fat-tailed (b < 1) dispersal feature. The results from a multilocus mating system analysis suggested that a small amount of biparental inbreeding and some correlated mating events occurred in the fragmented forests, which were similar to our parallel findings in the continuous forests of E. cavaleriei. Estimates of pollen pool structure (Phi(FT) = 0.128-0.174) indicated large genetic differences between pollen clouds accepted by maternal trees. The number of effective pollen donors (N-ep) in E. cavaleriei, estimated using both MLTR (N-ep = 4.2-5.3) and TWOGENER (N-ep =2.9-3.9) models, was equivalent to the number of effective pollen donors detected in continuous forests of E. cavaleriei. The pollen dispersal and mating patterns detected here indicated that habitat fragmentation did not have a negative impact on pollen movement in E. cavaleriei, possibly due to its generalist pollination system and the resilient foraging behavior of its pollinators in response to changes in landscape structure. The long distances of pollen-mediated gene flow between patches highlight the conservation value of remnant forest fragments in maintaining genetic connectivity at the landscape scale in subtropical China.

Despite the widespread nature of this strategy, we still know little about how spatial memory develops and guides individuals toward suitable routes. Here, we investigate whether flower visitation sequences by bumblebees Bombus terrestris simply reflect the order in which flowers were discovered or whether they result from more complex navigational strategies enabling bees to optimize their foraging routes. We analyzed bee flight movements in an array of four artificial flowers maximizing interfloral distances. Starting from a single patch, we sequentially added three new patches so that if bees visited them in the order in which they originally encountered flowers, they would follow a long (suboptimal) route. Bees' tendency to visit patches in their discovery order decreased with experience. Instead, they optimized their flight distances by rearranging flower visitation sequences. This resulted in the development of a primary route (trapline) and two or three less frequently used secondary routes. Bees consistently used these routes after overnight breaks while occasionally exploring novel possibilities. We discuss how maintaining some level of route flexibility could allow traplining animals to cope with dynamic routing problems, analogous to the well-known traveling salesman problem.",,,,"Chittka, Lars/C-3110-2012; Lihoreau, Mathieu/H-7623-2013","Chittka, Lars/0000-0001-8153-1732; Raine, Nigel/0000-0001-6343-2829",,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,DEC,2010,176,6,,,,,744,757,,10.1086/657042,,,,,,,WOS:000283743800009,20973670,,,,

We have little idea how landscape-scale factors influence the success of wild bumblebee nests over time. Here for the first time we use molecular markers to estimate within-season changes in the numbers of nests. 2. Workers of two bumblebee species were sampled in an arable landscape in late May-June and late July-August, and the numbers of nests represented in each sample were estimated. We compare the methods available to estimate nest number from such samples and conclude that methods which allow for heterogeneity in the probability of capture of nests provide the best fit to our data. Changes in numbers of nests at the two time points were used to infer nest survival. 3. The two bee species appeared to differ markedly in survival over time, with estimates of 45% of nests surviving for Bombus lapidarius and 91% for B. pascuorum. However, our data suggest that the foraging range of B. pascuorum may be greater in late season, which would lead us to overestimate nest survival in this species. Differential survival may also reflect differences in phenology between the two species. 4. The land use class which had the most consistent effects on nest number and survival was gardens; for B. lapidarius, the area of gardens within a 750 and 1000 mradius positively influenced nest survival, while for B. pascuorum, the number of nests in late samples was higher at sites with more gardens within a 500 and 750-m radius. For B. pascuorum, the area of grassland within a 250 and 500-mradius also positively influenced nest number in late samples, probably because this is the preferred nesting habitat for this species. 5. The importance of gardens is in accordance with previous studies which suggest that they now provide a stronghold for bumblebees in an otherwise impoverished agricultural environment; furthermore, our data suggest that the positive influence of gardens on bumblebee populations can spill over at least 1 km into surrounding farmland. 6. Synthesis and applications. The substantial effects that even small areas of local resources such as rough grassland or clover leys can have on bumblebee nest numbers and survival is of clear relevance for the design of pollinator management strategies.",,,,"Osborne, Juliet/I-6776-2012; Goulson, David/A-2462-2010; Lepais, Olivier/D-1849-2009","Goulson, David/0000-0003-4421-2876; Lepais, Olivier/0000-0002-6102-9478; Goffe, Louis/0000-0002-3623-2458",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,DEC,2010,47,6,,,,,1207,1215,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01872.x,,,,,,,WOS:000283983200007,,,,,

Two of these, Bombus terrestris and B. hortorum, are common in Europe whilst two, B. ruderatus and B. subterraneus, have experienced declines, and the latter is now extinct in the UK. The presence of these species in New Zealand presents an opportunity to study their ecology in a contrasting environment. Forage visits made by bumblebees in New Zealand were recorded across a season. Ninety-six percent of visits were to six non-native forage plants (Cirsium vulgare, Echium vulgare, Hypericum perforatum, Lotus corniculatus, Lupinus polyphyllus and Trifolium pratense). All but L. polyphyllus are European plant species, and three are noxious weeds in New Zealand. Several of these plants have decreased in abundance in the UK, providing a potential explanation for the declines of B. ruderatus and B. subterraneus in Britain. In contrast to studies conducted elsewhere, B. ruderatus, B. terrestris and B. hortorum did not differ in diet breadth and overlap in forage use was high, probably due to the reduced diversity of bumblebee forage plants present in New Zealand. Diel partitioning of forage use between the species was observed, with foraging activity of B. hortorum greatest in the morning and evening, B. ruderatus greatest in the middle of the day and B. terrestris intermediate between the two.

Insecticidal Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton is planted on millions of hectares annually and is a potential source of transgene flow. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we monitored 15 non-Bt cotton (Gossypium hirsutum, L.) seed production fields (some transgenic for herbicide resistance, some not) for gene flow of the Bt cotton cry1Ac transgene. We investigated seed-mediated gene flow, which yields adventitious Bt cotton plants, and pollen-mediated gene flow, which generates outcrossed seeds. A spatially-explicit statistical analysis was used to quantify the effects of nearby Bt and non-Bt cotton fields at various spatial scales, along with the effects of pollinator abundance and adventitious Bt plants in fields, on pollen-mediated gene flow. Adventitious Bt cotton plants, resulting from seed bags and planting error, comprised over 15% of plants sampled from the edges of three seed production fields. In contrast, pollen-mediated gene flow affected less than 1% of the seed sampled from field edges. Variation in outcrossing was better explained by the area of Bt cotton fields within 750 m of the seed production fields than by the area of Bt cotton within larger or smaller spatial scales. Variation in outcrossing was also positively associated with the abundance of honey bees. Conclusions/Significance: A comparison of statistical methods showed that our spatially-explicit analysis was more powerful for understanding the effects of surrounding fields than customary models based on distance.

Evidence from large birds (m(b) > 0.9 kg) suggests that soaring-gliding is considerably cheaper in terms of energy than flapping flight, and costs about two to three times the basal metabolic rate (BMR). Yet, soaring-gliding is considered unfavorable for small birds because migration speed in small birds during soaring-gliding is believed to be lower than that of flapping flight. Nevertheless, several small bird species routinely soar and glide. Methodology/Principal Findings: To estimate the energetic cost of soaring-gliding flight in small birds, we measured heart beat frequencies of free-ranging migrating European bee-eaters (Merops apiaster, m(b) similar to 55 g) using radio telemetry, and established the relationship between heart beat frequency and metabolic rate (by indirect calorimetry) in the laboratory. Heart beat frequency during sustained soaring-gliding was 2.2 to 2.5 times lower than during flapping flight, but similar to, and not significantly different from, that measured in resting birds. We estimated that soaring-gliding metabolic rate of European bee-eaters is about twice their basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is similar to the value estimated in the black-browed albatross Thalassarche (previously Diomedea) melanophrys, m(b) similar to 4 kg). We found that soaring-gliding migration speed is not significantly different from flapping migration speed. Conclusions/Significance: We found no evidence that soaring-gliding speed is slower than flapping flight in bee-eaters, contradicting earlier estimates that implied a migration speed penalty for using soaring-gliding rather than flapping flight. Moreover, we suggest that small birds soar and glide during migration, breeding, dispersal, and other stages in their annual cycle because it may entail a low energy cost of transport. We propose that the energy cost of soaring-gliding may be proportional to BMR regardless of bird size, as theoretically deduced by earlier studies.",,,,"Nathan, Ran/A-9380-2008; Sapir, Nir/V-9634-2019; McCue, Marshall/A-6227-2011","Sapir, Nir/0000-0002-2477-0515; McCue, Marshall/0000-0003-1255-285X",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Nov-11,2010,5,11,,,,,,,e13956,10.1371/journal.pone.0013956,,,,,,,WOS:000284087800020,21085655,,,,

Loss of suitable habitat to agricultural intensification is considered to be the main cause of declines in Europe. Differential impacts on species have been recorded but insufficient knowledge of species ecology means that effective conservation management prescriptions cannot be put into place with certainty. Dietary specialisation, specifically on flowers of Fabaceae, has been hypothesised as driving differential declines but the reliability of previous studies has been questioned. Here we present a 3-year study of the foraging behaviour of two UK Biodiversity Action Plan bumblebee species. For the first time, analysis of nectar and pollen foraging was performed on sites where nationally rare UK bumblebees were as abundant as more nationally ubiquitous species. Results indicated that the nationally rare Bombus sylvarum collected the majority of its pollen from flowers of Odontites verna and had a significantly narrower mean nectar dietary breadth than ecologically similar species Bombus humilis and Bombus pascuorum (p = 0.004 and 0.008, respectively). In contrast, the dietary breadth of the nationally rare B. humilis was similar to the more nationally ubiquitous species B. pascuorum and Bombus lapidarius. Moreover, B. lapidarius was recorded as having the narrowest pollen dietary breadth, collected pollen from the least number of floral taxa and was the most specialised of the Bombus species on pollen of Fabaceae. Patterns of dietary specialisation were inconsistent with national declines and results highlighted a need for further detailed investigation into the factors contributing to differential declines.

Here, we use molecular genetic methods in an ecological context to demonstrate that endemic Hawaiian Hylaeus bees (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) selectively collect pollen from native plant species in Haleakala and Hawaii Volcanoes National Parks. We identified pollen DNA from the crops (internal storage organs) of 21 Hylaeus specimens stored in ethanol for up to 3 years. Genetic analyses reveal high fidelity in pollen foraging despite the availability of pollen from multiple plant species present at each study site. At high elevations in Haleakala, pollen was available from more than 12 species of flowering plants, but Hawaiian silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp. macrocephalum) comprised 86% of all pollen samples removed from bee crops. At lower elevations in both parks, we only detected pukiawe (Leptecophylla (Styphelia) tameiameiae) pollen in Hylaeus crops despite the presence of other plant species in flower during our study. Furthermore, 100% of Hylaeus crops from which we successfully identified pollen contained native plant pollen. The molecular approaches developed in this study provide species-level information about floral visitation of Hawaiian Hylaeus that does not require specialized palynological expertise needed for high-throughput visual pollen identification.

Here, we investigate the population structure of Colletes floralis, a rare and threatened solitary mining bee, in Ireland and Scotland using nine microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was surprisingly as high in Scottish (Hebridean island) populations at the extreme northwestern edge of the species range as in mainland Irish populations further south. Extremely high genetic differentiation among populations was detected; multilocus F-ST was up to 0.53, and G'(ST) and D-est were even higher (maximum: 0.85 and 1.00, respectively). A pattern of isolation by distance was evident for sites separated by land. Water appears to act as a substantial barrier to gene flow yet sites separated by sea did not exhibit isolation by distance. C. floralis populations are extremely isolated and probably not in regional migration-drift equilibrium.

Nectar was collected, the volume was determined and the total dissolved solids were determined by refractometer. Air temperature, relative humidity and light intensity were also registered. The number of pollen loads reached its maximum value between 70% and 90% of relative humidity and 18 degrees C and 23 degrees C; for nectar loads this range was broader, 50-90% and 20-30 degrees C. The number of pollen loads increased as relative humidity rose (rs = 0.401; P < 0.01) and high temperatures had a strong negative influence on the number of pollen loads collected (rs = -0.228; P < 0.01). The number of nectar loads positively correlated with temperature (rs = 0.244; P < 0.01) and light intensity (rs = 0.414; P < 0.01). The percentage of total dissolved solids (TDS) on nectar loads positively correlated with temperature and light intensity (rs = 0.361; P < 0.01 and rs = 0.245; P < 0.01), negatively correlated with relative humidity (rs = -0.629; P < 0.01), and it increased along the day.

However, the success of microbiological control agents (MCAs) largely depends on efficient dissemination into the crop. The pollinator-and-vector technology employs pollinating insects like bees for a better dissemination. In this study, a new dispenser for bumblebee workers of Bombus terrestris L. was developed. Binab-T-vector and Prestop-Mix were used as two typical MCA products for dissemination. RESULTS: In a first series of experiments in the laboratory for optimisation, the newly developed dispenser was a two-way type dispenser, 20 cm long, with two rectangular compartments and different entrance and exit holes. In addition, the amounts of MCA loaded on the workers were 10 times higher with the new dispenser as compared with the side-by-side passageway (SSP) dispenser. Typically, the highest amounts were recovered from the thorax and legs of the workers. In a second series of experiments under greenhouse conditions with the use of queen-right B. terrestris hives, successful dissemination in strawberry flowers was obtained at different distances from the hive (0-8 m, 8-18 m and 18-21 m), and the workers inoculated the first, second and third flowers that were consecutively visited. In addition, the new dispenser caused no adverse effects on worker foraging intensity, whereas a dramatic reduction was scored with an SSP dispenser. Finally, the data suggested that it is necessary to refill the newly developed dispenser at 3 day intervals. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that, with the use of the newly developed dispenser, bumblebee workers carried high amounts of MCA, and this resulted in a successful dissemination of MCA into strawberry flowers.

The fact that most of these substances have an unpalatable taste for humans and other mammals contrasts with the fact that honeybees do not reject them in the range of concentrations in which these compounds are present in flower nectars. Here we asked whether honeybees detect and ingest deterrent substances and whether these substances are really toxic to them. Results: We show that pairing aversive substances with an odor retards learning of this odor when it is subsequently paired with sucrose. Harnessed honeybees in the laboratory ingest without reluctance a considerable volume (20 mu l) of various aversive substances, even if some of them induce significant post-ingestional mortality. These substances do not seem, therefore, to be unpalatable to harnessed bees but induce a malaise-like state that in some cases results in death. Consistently with this finding, bees learning that one odor is associated with sugar, and experiencing in a subsequent phase that the sugar was paired with 20 mu l of an aversive substance (devaluation phase), respond less than control bees to the odor and the sugar. Such stimulus devaluation can be accounted for by the malaise-like state induced by the aversive substances. Conclusion: Our results indicate that substances that taste bitter to humans as well as concentrated saline solutions base their aversive effect on the physiological consequences that their ingestion generates in harnessed bees rather than on an unpalatable taste. This conclusion is only valid for harnessed bees in the laboratory as freely-moving bees might react differently to aversive compounds could actively reject aversive substances. Our results open a new possibility to study conditioned taste aversion based on post-ingestional malaise and thus broaden the spectrum of aversive learning protocols available in honeybees.",,,,"Giurfa, Martin/H-5140-2016; Giurfa, Martin/A-7322-2008","Giurfa, Martin/0000-0001-7173-769X; de Brito Sanchez, Maria Gabriela/0000-0001-6940-8088",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Oct-27,2010,5,10,,,,,,,e15000,10.1371/journal.pone.0015000,,,,,,,WOS:000283537000060,21060877,,,,

These advanced levels of cooperation, however, remain limited to a small range of species, and we still know little about the mechanisms underlying group foraging behaviours in the great mass of animals exhibiting lower levels of social complexity. In this paper, we report, for the first time in a gregarious insect, the cockroach Blattella germanica (L.), a collective foraging decision whereby the selection of food sources is reached without requiring active recruitment. Groups of cockroaches given a binary choice between identical food sources exhibited exploitation asymmetries whose amplitude increases with group size. By coupling behavioural observations to computer simulations, we demonstrate that selection of food sources relies uniquely on a retention effect of feeding individuals on newcomers without comparison between available opportunities. This self-organised pattern presents similarities with the foraging dynamics of eusocial species, thus stressing the generic dimension of collective decision-making mechanisms based on social amplification rules despite fundamental differences in recruitment processes.

Responses are often variable among species within groups making general predictions difficult. One option is to include ecological trait information that might help to disentangle patterns of response and also provide greater understanding of how particular traits link whole clades to their environment. Although this ""trait-guild"" approach has been used for single disturbances, the importance of particular traits on general responses to multiple disturbances has not been explored. We used a mixed model analysis of 19 data sets from throughout the world to test the effect of ecological and life-history traits on the responses of bee species to different types of anthropogenic environmental change. These changes included habitat loss, fragmentation, agricultural intensification, pesticides and fire. Individual traits significantly affected bee species responses to different disturbances and several traits were broadly predictive among multiple disturbances. The location of nests - above vs. below ground - significantly affected response to habitat loss, agricultural intensification, tillage regime (within agriculture) and fire. Species that nested above ground were on average more negatively affected by isolation from natural habitat and intensive agricultural land use than were species nesting below ground. In contrast below-ground-nesting species were more negatively affected by tilling than were above-ground nesters. The response of different nesting guilds to fire depended on the time since the burn. Social bee species were more strongly affected by isolation from natural habitat and pesticides than were solitary bee species. Surprisingly, body size did not consistently affect species responses, despite its importance in determining many aspects of individuals' interaction with their environment. Although synergistic interactions among traits remain to be explored, individual traits can be useful in predicting and understanding responses of related species to global change.

This raises the question of the risk of dissemination of genetically modified (GM) pollen to non-GM crops by visiting insects. We inventoried the flower-visiting insects in Bt and non-Bt cotton fields of the South African Highveld region and investigated their role in pollen dispersal. Their diversity and abundance varied slightly among sites, with Astylus atromaculatus as the predominant insect on both Bt and non-Bt cotton flowers. The other major flower-visiting species were Apis mellifera and solitary Apidae. No differences were found in the abundance of each taxum between Bt and non-Bt cotton except for Scoliidae and Nitidulidae, which were scarce overall (<0.5%) but more abundant on the non-Bt flowers in the central area of the field at one site. The pollen load on A. atromaculatus was as high as on Apis mellifera. Cage tests showed that A. atromaculatus can pollinate female cotton plants by transferring pollen from male donor plants. In the field, the flight range of this insect was generally short (25 m), but it can occasionally reach up to 200 m or even more. This study therefore highlights that A. atromaculatus, commonly regarded as a pest, could be an unexpected but efficient pollinator.

Such predators can be costly to their host plant by consuming pollinators. However, sit-and-wait predators are often prey generalists that also consume plant antagonists such as herbivores, nectar robbers and granivores, so may also provide benefits to their host plant. Here we present a simple, but general, model that provides novel predictions about how costs and benefits interact in different ecological circumstances. The model predicts that the ecological conditions in which flower-dwelling predators are found can generate either net benefits to their host plants, net costs to their host plants, or can have no effect on the fitness of their host plants. The net effect is influenced by the relative densities of mutualists and antagonists. The flower-dwelling predator has a strong positive effect on the plant if both the pollinators and the granivores are at high density. Further, the range of density combinations that yield a positive net outcome for the plant increases if the performance of pollinators is negatively density dependent, if the predator is only moderately effective at influencing flower visitor rates by its potential prey, and if pollinators are very effective. If plants of a given species find themselves consistently in conditions where they benefit from the presence of a predator then we predict that natural selection could favour the evolution of plant traits that increase the likelihood of predator recruitment and retention, especially where plants are served by highly effective pollinators.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,,,,OCT,2010,164,2,,,,,411,421,,10.1007/s00442-010-1681-6,,,,,,,WOS:000281860700013,20563603,,,,

We approach this problem through a study of image matching, a navigational strategy in which insects reach a familiar place by moving so that their current retinal image transforms to match a memorized snapshot of the scene viewed from that place. Analysis of how navigating wood ants correct their course when close to a goal reveals a significant part of the mechanism underlying this transformation. Ants followed a short route to an inconspicuous feeder positioned at a fixed distance from a vertical luminance edge. They responded to an unexpected jump of the edge by turning to face the new feeder position specified by the edge. Importantly, the initial speed of the turn increased linearly with the turn's amplitude. This correlation implies that the ants' turns are driven initially by their prior calculation of the angular difference between the current retinal position of the edge and its desired position in their memorized view. Similar turns keep ants to their path during unperturbed routes. The neural circuitry mediating image-matching is thus concerned not only with the storage of views, but also with making exact comparisons between the retinal positions of a visual feature in a memorized view and of the same feature in the current retinal image.",,,,"Graham, Paul/C-6420-2009","Graham, Paul/0000-0002-3745-0940",,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,,,,,Sep-14,2010,107,37,,,,,16348,16353,,10.1073/pnas.1006021107,,,,,,,WOS:000281799000068,20805481,,,,
J,"Jacquemyn, H; Hutchings, MJ",,,,"Jacquemyn, Hans; Hutchings, Michael J.",,,Biological Flora of the British Isles: Spiranthes spiralis (L.) Chevall.,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"P>1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Spiranthes spiralis (L.) Chevall. that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Spiranthes spiralis is a long-lived orchid species that is widely distributed in the southern part of the British Isles, southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is native to Britain. Its most characteristic habitats are unimproved, well-grazed grasslands on dry calcareous soils, particularly chalk and limestone, cliff-tops and grassy coastal dunes. It can also be found in garden lawns and, less frequently, in slightly acidic heathland habitat. It occurs on both dry and wet soils, but it does not tolerate heavy shading. 3. Spiranthes spiralis is a non-bulbous geophyte regenerating by sexual reproduction and by vegetative spread, although the latter is limited. Vegetative reproduction involves the growth of a lateral bud on the underground stem. The new plant forms its own tubers, and eventually the connection between the mother plant and the vegetatively produced daughter plant withers away. 4. The main perennating organ is a tuberous root. In most years, the tuber generates a rosette of expanded leaves, and at the end of every year of the plant's life, the tuber is completely replaced. In some cases, however, only part of the reserves is exhausted in flowering and, when this happens, a tuber may survive for several years. Vegetative adult dormancy - the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a growing season, followed by reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic plants in subsequent seasons - has been observed. It most commonly lasts for only 1 year, but sometimes plants can remain dormant for several years. 5. The species is not autogamous and pollinators - mainly bumblebees and bees - are necessary for successful pollination and fruit set. Natural levels of fruit set are usually < 50%. Hand-pollination increases fruit set to c. 75%, indicating that reproduction is to some extent pollen-limited. Sexual reproduction comes at a cost, and few individuals flower for two or more consecutive years. Within fruits many very small seeds are produced, but most are dispersed to a distance of less than a few dm from maternal plants, leading to strongly aggregated distribution patterns and significant spatial genetic structuring within natural populations. 6. Spiranthes spiralis has suffered significant declines in distribution in Britain and other European countries. In Britain, populations were lost from many sites before 1930, when many pastures were re-sown or converted to arable land. Losses of populations due to agricultural intensification (ploughing of old fields and fertilization) still occur and are the major causes of the decline of the species. Conservation of remnant populations primarily requires the maintenance of a short turf by grazing, most often by sheep. Ideally, grazing should be suspended during flowering and seed set, allowing new recruits to become established and adult plants to flower profusely and to produce seeds.",,,,"Jacquemyn, Hans/AAC-4875-2019","Jacquemyn, Hans/0000-0001-9600-5794",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,,,,,SEP,2010,98,5,,,,,1253,1267,,10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01701.x,,,,,,,WOS:000280667200029,,,,,

Parameter extraction in MESFET process involves minimizing the error, which is measured as the difference between modeled and measured S parameter over a broad frequency range. This error surface is viewed as a multi-modal error surface and robust optimization algorithms are required to solve this kind of problem. This paper proposes an ABC algorithm that simulates the foraging behavior of honey bee swarm for model parameter extraction. The performance comparison of both the algorithms (ABC and PSO) are compared with respect to computational time and the quality of solutions (QoS).

Melipona, like Apis, possesses the remarkable ability to use representational communication to indicate the location of foraging patches. Although Melipona has been the subject of numerous behavioral, ecological, and genetic studies, the evolutionary history of this genus remains largely unexplored. Here, we implement a multigene phylogenetic approach based on nuclear, mitochondrial, and ribosomal loci, coupled with molecular clock methods, to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships and antiquity of subgenera and species of Melipona. Our phylogenetic analysis resolves the relationship among subgenera and tends to agree with morphology-based classification hypotheses. Our molecular clock analysis indicates that the genus Melipona shared a most recent common ancestor at least similar to 14-17 million years (My) ago.

Since land management affects pollinator numbers, it is also likely to affect the resultant pollination of plants growing in these habitats. We hypothesised that the seed or fruit set of two plant species, typically pollinated by bumblebees and/or honeybees might respond in one of two ways: 1) pollination success could be reduced when growing in a floriferous environment, via competition for pollinators, or 2) pollination success could be enhanced because of increased pollinator abundance in the vicinity. Methodology/Principal Findings: We compared the pollination success of experimental plants of Glechoma hederacea L. and Lotus corniculatus L. growing in gardens and arable farmland. On the farms, the plants were placed either next to a mass-flowering crop (oilseed rape, Brassica napus L. or field beans, Vicia faba L.) or next to a cereal crop (wheat, Triticum spp.). Seed set of G. hederacea and fruit set of L. corniculatus were significantly higher in gardens compared to arable farmland. There was no significant difference in pollination success of G. hederacea when grown next to different crops, but for L. corniculatus, fruit set was higher in the plants growing next to oilseed rape when the crop was in flower. Conclusions/Significance: The results show that pollination services can limit fruit set of wild plants in arable farmland, but there is some evidence that the presence of a flowering crop can facilitate their pollination (depending on species and season).

GP was originally developed in the field of criminology for predicting the area where an offender most likely resides on the basis of the actual crime sites and the predefined probability of crime interaction. The predefined probability of crime interaction in the GP model depends on the distance of a site from an offender's residence. We applied GP for predicting nest locations, assuming that foraging and nest sites were the crime sites and the offenders' residences, respectively. We identified the foraging and nest sites of the invasive species Bombus terrestris in 2004,2005, and 2006. We fitted GP model coefficients to the field data of the foraging and nest sites, and used GP with the fitting coefficients. GP succeeded in predicting about 10-30% of actual nests. Sensitivity analysis showed that the predictability of the GP model mainly depended on the coefficient value of buffer zone, the distance at the mode of the foraging probability. GP will be able to predict the nest locations of bumble bees in other area by using the fitting coefficient values measured in this study. It will be possible to further improve the predictability of the GP model by considering food site preference and nest density. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Pollination is by bees or bats, raising the question of the evolutionary direction and frequency of pollinator shifts. Studies that investigated such shifts in other clades have suggested that bat pollination might be an evolutionary end point. Methods: Plastid and nuclear DNA sequences were obtained for 50 accessions representing 30 species of Cayaponia and close relatives, and analyses were carried out to test monophyly, infer divergence times, and reconstruct ancestral states for habitat preferences and pollination modes. Key results: The phylogeny shows that Cayaponia is monophyletic as long as Selysia (a genus with four species from Central and South America) is included. The required nomenclatural transfers are made in this paper. African and Madagascan accessions of C. africana form a clade that is part of a polytomy with Caribbean and South American species, and the inferred divergence time of 2-5 Ma implies a transoceanic dispersal event from the New World to Africa. The ancestral state reconstructions suggest that Cayaponia originated in tropical forests from where open savannas were reached several times and that bee pollination arose from bat pollination, roughly concomitant with the shifts from forests to savanna habitats. Conclusions: Cayaponia provides the first example of evolutionary transitions from bat to bee pollination as well as another instance of transoceanic dispersal from the New World to Africa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9122,,,,,JUL,2010,97,7,,,,,1129,1141,,10.3732/ajb.0900385,,,,,,,WOS:000279548600008,21616865,,,,

Floral visitation is commonly observed, and in many groups specialized mouthpart morphology is associated with deep nectar extraction. In parasitic wasps, there are few data examining the relationship between host plant use and the length of the mouthparts. In an effort to associate mouthpart length to nectar source, pollen was identified from museum specimens of selected species of Agathirsia (Hymenoptera Braconidae). Despite drastic differences in glossa length, the pollen of several species of Asteraceae were commonly found on specimens of various species. We infer that increased feeding efficiency, as opposed to nectar access, is the adaptive value of elongate glossae in Agathirsia. Species with short mouthparts, however, exhibited a difference from both the medium and long mouthpart categories in pollen similarity. This suggests that members of Agathirsia with elongated mouthparts are more apt to visit certain flowers compared with short-tongued species. Males and females exhibited considerable overlap of their common nectar sources and displayed similar pollen richness. Pollen richness was higher in species in the medium length category compared with the short category, but these results are confounded by the fact that the medium-length specimens were on average larger bodied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-8746,1938-2901,,,,JUL,2010,103,4,,,,,566,573,,10.1603/AN09093,,,,,,,WOS:000279548300012,,,,,

(Faboideae) and the large bee Xylocopa (Neoxylocopa) cearensis Ducke, 1910 (Apoidea, Hymenoptera), in tropical sand dune",BIOTA NEOTROPICA,,,,,,,,,,,,"Stylosanthes viscosa is a common 'herb' in the tropical sand dunes of the Brazilian coast with clumped distribution in urban sand dunes of Salvador, BA. Its tiny keel flower with a very small amount of nectar hidden inside the corolla tube, a single open flower/inflorescence/day and the low floral density altogether should not be attractive to large bees. This should be true mainly upon the high-demanded energy for thermoregulation within the tropical sand dunes. Contrary to this expectation, most of the bee species sampled on S. viscosa flowers were medium to large sized bees and harvested nectar in legitimate visits by activating the keel's pollination mechanism of flowers. However, the keel was always inactivated after being visited by the enormous and frequent (78%) Xylocopa bees. All the flowers visited by these bees (including those with inactivated keels), and those experimentally protected from bee visiting produced fruits (100%). The specialized embolus mechanism of the anthers assures self-pollination. Because of this autonomous self-pollination and self-compatibility it was not possible to discriminate the relative importance of both facilitated self-pollination and cross-pollination by bees. Nevertheless, the large Xylocopa bees didn't limit self-pollination. Xylocopa cearensis was the most abundant bee (63%) and it visited several flowers (13.0 +/- 4.27) in each flight route in the same clump, in spite of the low floral density therein (5 to 20 flowers.m(-2)). Flight distances between successive flowers varied between one and two meters (49%), and so they were higher than would be possible (15 to 70 cm) given the floral density in the clumps. The flight routes were directional, and most of shifting direction between successive flowers was below 90 degrees with high frequency of small angles (<30 degrees). This general pattern is explained by foraging optimization with adjustments to critical resource level thresholds. Paradoxically, floral biology and flowering pattern of S. viscosa should discourage the largest dune dweller bees, but this strategy works just temporarily. In this melittophilous species, the autonomous self-pollination (assured by the embolus) can be better explained by the automatic selection hypothesis rather than by reproductive assurance hypothesis, considering the availability of large bee pollinators in the tropical dunes.",,,,"Ramalho, Mauro/K-7178-2014","Ramalho, Mauro/0000-0001-8287-7479",,,,,,,,,,,,1676-0603,,,,,JUL-SEP,2010,10,3,,,,,93,100,,10.1590/S1676-06032010000300010,,,,,,,WOS:000296130900011,,,,,

The previous study revealed that red-phase flowers no longer have sexual function and nectar, and bumblebees selectively visit yellow-phase flowers. The present study examined how retaining color-changed flowers can regulate the foraging behavior of bumblebees and pollen transport among flowers within (geitonogamous pollination) and between (outcrossing pollination) plants and how the behavior is influenced by display size (i.e., number of functional flowers) and visitation frequency. The visitation frequencies of bumblebees to plants and successive flower probes within plants were observed in the field using plants whose flower number and composition of the two color-phase flowers had been manipulated. To evaluate pollination efficiency over multiple pollinator visits, a pollen transport model was constructed based on the observed bumblebee behavior. In the simulation, three flowering patterns associated with display size and existence of color-changed flowers were postulated as follows: Type 1, large display (100 functional flowers) and no retention of color-changed flowers; Type 2, small display (50 functional flowers) and retention of color-changed flowers (50 old flowers), and; Type 3, large display (100 functional flowers) and retention of color-changed flowers (100 old flowers). Color-changed flowers did not contribute to increasing bumblebee attraction at a distance but reduced the number of successive flower probes within plants. Comparisons of pollen transfer between Types 1 and 3 revealed that the retention of color-changed flowers did not influence the total amount of pollen exported when pollinator visits were abundant (> 100 visits) but decreased geitonogamous pollination. Comparisons between Types 2 and 3 revealed that the discouragement effect of floral color change on successive probes accelerated in plants with a large display size. Overall, the floral color change strategy contributed to reduce geitonogamous pollination, but its effectiveness was highly sensitive to display size and pollinator frequency.",,,,"Kudo, Gaku/A-2733-2015","Kudo, Gaku/0000-0002-6488-818X",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-7653,,,,,JUL,2010,24,4,,,,,671,684,,10.1007/s10682-009-9324-2,,,,,,,WOS:000278833400003,,,,,

By means of a mixture of analytical methods and simulation, we also extended-and then applied-genetic methods for estimating foraging distance and nest density in wild bees. B. distinguendus populations were characterized by low expected heterozygosity and allelic richness, inbreeding coefficients not significantly different from zero, absence of detected diploid males, absence of substantial demographic bottlenecking, and population substructuring at large (c. 100+ km) but not small (10s of km) spatial scales.

We tested the foraging rhythms of bumblebee (Bombus terrestris and B. pascuorum) colonies in northern Finland during the summer, when the sun stays above the horizon for weeks. We used fully automatic radio-frequency identification to monitor the foraging activity of more than 1,000 workers and analysed their circadian foraging rhythms. Results: Foragers did not use the available 24-h foraging period but exhibited robust diurnal rhythms instead. A mean of 95.2% of the tested B. terrestris workers showed robust diurnal rhythms with a mean period of 23.8 h. Foraging activity took place mainly between 08:00 and 23:00, with only low or almost no activity during the rest of the day. Activity levels increased steadily during the morning, reached a maximum around midday and decreased again during late afternoon and early evening. Foraging patterns of native B. pascuorum followed the same temporal organisation, with the foraging activity being restricted to the period between 06:00 and 22:00. Conclusions: The results of the present study indicate that the circadian clock of the foragers must have been entrained by some external cue, the most prominent being daily cycles in light intensity and temperature.

Orchids have complex and delicate interactions with their pollinators, which makes them particularly prone to local extinction. Conservation actions should be encouraged for a range of endangered Mediterranean orchid species, but the current taxonomic confusion in several genera and the apparent disagreement among orchid taxonomists make the situation particularly confusing from a conservation perspective. In this review, we document how the different pollination syndromes of Mediterranean orchids (nectar reward, shelter offering, food deception and sexual deception) can have a profound impact on the type of reproductive barriers among species, on floral phenotypic variation as we perceive it, on potentially related processes of species sorting and extinction and, consequently, should have a strong influence on the related conservation management programs. We also highlight that the majority of Mediterranean orchids are pollinated by specialised bees often occupying otherwise narrow ecological niches (e.g. pollen specialisation, brood cell parasites, specific nesting site). This condition makes the orchid-pollinator interactions very fragile and several orchid species prone to local extinction. We illustrate this phenomenon by a selection of case studies that show how the adequate integration of the ecological requirements/traits of the orchids and their associated pollinators into conservation actions could help protect endangered species and ensure the sustainability of the often complex local pollination web.",,,,,"Vereecken, Nicolas/0000-0002-8858-4623",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-8101,1874-9372,,,,JUN,2010,76,2,,,,,220,240,,10.1007/s12229-010-9049-5,,,,,,,WOS:000277604400007,,,,,

It is endemic to the biodiversity hotspot of the southern Western Ghats of India and, besides ants, harbours many endemic invertebrate taxa, such as bees that pollinate it as well as arboreal earthworms, within swollen hollow stem internodes called domatia. Using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, three geographically separated populations were found to be multiclonal, characterized by high levels of clonal diversity. Values for the Simpson diversity index ranged between 0.764 and 0.964, and for Fager's evenness index between 0.00 and 0.036 for neighbourhoods within populations. This myrmecophyte was found to combine sexual recruitment (66.7%) and clonal production (33.3%) as methods of reproduction. Moderate amounts of genetic diversity at the species level were observed, with 52.63% polymorphism, and moderate values of Shannon's diversity index (0.1895) as well as of Nei's gene diversity (0.1186). In each population, observed genotypic diversity was significantly lower than expected, indicating significant genetic structure. Neighbour-joining trees demonstrated that Agumbe, which is the most northern population examined and geographically twice as far away from the other two populations, grouped separately and with larger bootstrap support from a larger cluster consisting of the Sampaji and Solaikolli populations, which are closer to each other geographically. Some neighbourhoods within each population showed spatial genetic structure even at small spatial scales of <5 m. A combination of clonality and short-distance pollen movement by small pollinating bees (Braunsapis puangensis) coupled with primary ballistic seed dispersal, and possible secondary seed dispersal by rodents, may contribute to spatial genetic structure at such small scales. The clonality of H. brunonis may be a factor that contributes to its dominance in Western Ghat forests where it supports a rich diversity of invertebrate fauna.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0250-5991,0973-7138,,,,JUN,2010,35,2,,,,,267,279,,10.1007/s12038-010-0031-5,,,,,,,WOS:000278512100014,20689183,,,,

We developed an insecticide program risk (IPR) index to quantify the relative risk to wild bees of insecticide programs applied to blueberry fields. This was used to determine the relationship between IPR and the abundance, diversity, and richness of wild bee communities sampled during three successive flowering seasons. In 2 of 3 yr, bee abundance and species richness declined with increasing IPR. Bee diversity declined with IPR in one of 3 yr. These results indicate that wild bee communities are negatively affected by increasingly intensive chemical pest management activities in crop fields and that interyear variability in bee populations has the potential to mask such effects in short-term studies. When several wild bee species were analyzed separately, two of three solitary and one of three social blueberry-foraging species declined with increasing IPR values, suggesting that different life histories and nesting habits may help some bee populations escape the negative effects of insecticides applied after bloom. Pollinator conservation programs aimed strictly at reducing insecticide use may have varying success, depending on the biology of the target bee species.

The Ceratinini therefore provides an excellent group to understand the factors that help determine the biogeography and radiation of the bees. This is the first molecular study of ceratinine bees covering representatives from both northern and southern hemisphere Old and New World regions. We use two mitochondrial and one nuclear marker (totalling 2807 nucleotides) to examine the age, cladogenesis and historical biogeography of this tribe. Tree topology and molecular dating support an African origin at about 47 Mya with subsequent dispersal into Eurasia 44 Mya, and followed by an American invasion 32 Mya. Concentrated African and Malagasy sampling revealed there were two or three dispersals events into Madagascar ranging from 25 to 9 Mya. Lineage through time analyses suggest higher rates of cladogenesis close to the origin of the tribe, and this corresponds to both major dispersal events and divergences of lineages leading to extant subgenera. Ceratinini have potentially great importance for future studies to understand the relative roles of dispersal ability and time of origin in determining bee biogeography. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Floral characteristics indicated adaptations to long-tongued flower visitors. The three species possess large, conspicuously colored flowers that produced sucrose-rich nectar (concentrations: 16.4%-23.9%) and emit a rosy floral perfume with a citrus-related aspect, dominated by terpenoids. Principal scent compounds of V. caerulea and V rosea were (E)-nerolidol and geraniol, and (E)-8-oxo-beta-farnesene [(E)-2,6-dimethyl-10-methylenedodeca-2,6,11-trien-5-one, a new natural product] and (E,E)-farnesyl acetate in V. clavata. Germinating pollen grains were observed in the anthers of all species, forming large interwoven clumps that were transferred by the pollinators as a unit. In V. caerulea and V. rosea, stamens and stigmas were positioned close together, enabling the plants to self-pollinate. In contrast, male and female organs are widely separated in V. clavaia. Pollen to ovule ratios of all species were low (33-78), indicating that pollen transfer (either by selling or by outcrossing) is very efficient. Flower visitors were butterflies (V. caerulea, V. rosea) and/or long-tongued bees of the genus Euglossa (V. clavata, V. rosea). Nevertheless, Voyria caerulea and V. rosea were visited only rarely and irregularly. We suggest that these two species follow a mixed selfing-outcrossing strategy to ensure seed production when pollen transfer by visitors fails. In contrast, V. clavata showed a high degree of specialization towards euglossine-pollinators, which were frequent visitors. The close plant-pollinator interaction increases the probability of outcrossings and might have enabled this species to completely rely on pollinators for reproduction. Average seed set in the studied species ranged between 36% and 49% and was very variable among individuals, probably due to resource-limitation. The capsules of V. caerulea and V. clavata showed characteristics of endozoochorous dispersal and were frequently found damaged by possible rodent dispersal agents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0040-0262,1996-8175,,,,JUN,2010,59,3,,,,,867,880,,10.1002/tax.593015,,,,,,,WOS:000278744000015,,,,,

J,"Rands, SA; Whitney, HM",,,,"Rands, Sean A.; Whitney, Heather M.",,,Effects of pollinator density-dependent preferences on field margin visitations in the midst of agricultural monocultures: A modelling approach,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Managed field margins offer a means of reducing the impact of agricultural monocultures within intensively managed environments. By providing refuge for wild plants and the pollinators associated with them, field margins can also contribute to enhancing the pollination services within the monoculture. However, the effects of the monoculture on pollinator behaviour need to be carefully considered. It is known that pollinators may show density-dependent preferences such as neophobia (an avoidance of unfamiliar items) when different types of flower are available within their environment, and the dominance of monoculture crops within the environment may consequently have adverse effects upon the preferences shown by pollinators living in the field margins within them. In order to examine how pollinator preferences for wild flowers are affected by monocultures, we modelled the effects of density-dependent preferences, flower densities, and the geometry of field margins within a monoculture landscape using numerical simulations. This was done by considering how the placement of pollinator nests within a simple, spatially explicit landscape consisting of fields of monoculture crops separated by margins containing wild flowers affected the ratio of wild and monoculture crops experienced by the pollinator, given that it could only forage within a limited distance from its nest. Increasing field margin width and decreasing monoculture field width both led to an increase in pollinators visiting wild flowers (which levelled off as width increased). The size of the monoculture fields had little additional effect once they had passed an intermediate width. Increasing wild flower density within the margins led to a shift away from preferring monocultures. When wild flowers were at low densities compared to the monoculture, even the addition of small amounts of extra wild flowers had a large effect in shifting foraging preferences away from the monoculture. The distance which pollinators normally forage over only has an effect upon preferences for wild flowers when the travel distance is small. This suggests that careful consideration of margin design might be extremely important for those species which do not travel far. Innate preferences for density-dependence and particular crop types may also have an effect on preference behaviour. We demonstrate that the way in which resources are presented to indigenous pollinators may be extremely important in influencing where they choose to forage within agricultural landscapes. Careful margin design, as well as increasing the density of wild flowers (such as by enhancing the wild seed bank within the margins), may lead to overall improvements in ecosystem function within intensively farmed monocultures.

We compared the resource use (pollen diets) among seven feral colonies of Bombus ardens located in an area of 2.5 x 2.5 km(2). Because this area was likely to be within their maximum foraging distance, most floral resources could have been accessible to all colonies alike. Similarities in pollen diets among these colonies may suggest that the surrounding resources determine resources use, while deviations from this could reveal other factors that affect resources use among colonies. We examined if colonies showed similarities in pollen diets and if colonies do differ in pollen diets, we investigated whether factors, such as establishment year, colony size, and location, affected the colony pollen diets. We found that while the choices of floral resources were similar, the proportional use of the floral resources were significantly different, suggesting that the surrounding resources do not solely determine resource use among colonies. Further analyses showed that the dissimilarity of pollen diets between two colonies increased as spatial distance decreased, as the temporal distances increased, and as the difference in colony size increased. We found that other than differences in annual variances of resources distribution, colony size was the prominent factor that affected the resource use of our seven colonies.

In this study, the impact of increased foraging distance on the duration of foraging bouts and on the number of brood cells provisioned per time unit was experimentally quantified in the two pollen specialist solitary bee species Hoplitis adunca and Chelostoma rapunculi. Females nesting at different sites foraged under the same environmental conditions on a single large and movable flowering host plant patch in an otherwise host plant free landscape. 3.

Contrary to expectation, a widely scattered arrangement of host plants did not result in longer mean duration of a foraging bout in H. adunca compared to a highly aggregated arrangement, which might be due to a reduced flight directionality combined with a high rate of revisitation of already depleted flowers in the aggregated plant arrangement or by a stronger competition and disturbance by other flower visitors. 5.

Consequently, pollinators are more likely to encounter predators when visiting the most rewarding flowers. I present a model of how different pollinator species can maximize lifetime resource gains depending on the density and distribution of predators, as well as their vulnerability to capture by predators. For pollinator species that are difficult for predators to capture, the optimal strategy is to visit the most rewarding flowers as long as predator density is low. At higher predator densities and for pollinators that are more vulnerable to predator capture, the lifetime resource gain from the most rewarding flowers declines and the optimal strategy depends on the predator distribution. In some cases, a wide range of floral rewards provides near-maximum lifetime resource gains, which may favor generalization if searching for flowers is costly. In other cases, a low flower reward level provides the maximum lifetime resource gain and so pollinators should specialize on less rewarding flowers. Thus, the model suggests that predators can have qualitatively different top-down effects on plant reproductive success depending on the pollinator species, the density of predators, and the distribution of predators across flower reward levels.",,,,"Jones, Emily/B-7895-2010","Jones, Emily/0000-0002-0605-884X",,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,,,,,MAY,2010,119,5,,,,,835,840,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17841.x,,,,,,,WOS:000276936000011,,,,,

As the urbanisation is usually irreversible, the urban context has to be taken into account when defining appropriate management measures to sustain viable populations. Connectivity through pollen flow appears to be a key-factor for the long-term persistence of populations of insect-pollinated plant species. We investigated pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue in Lychnis flos-cuculi, an insect-pollinated wetland herb, along the Woluwe River, in Brussels urban zone (Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with particles mainly deposited on neighbouring individuals and populations. The mean distance of dye transfer was 133.6 m, with a maximal distance of 523.7 m. Dye deposition was positively related to the number of potential recipient plants when distance to dye source was held constant. This may be associated with a higher flowering plant density across the flying distance that increases attractiveness and visitation rate of pollinators, and/or with secondary dye transfer. When connected, small and large populations only differed in response to the number of potential recipients. The small isolated population received little immigrant pollen flow, but remained a dye donor. Our study demonstrates that small populations of L. flos-cucli along an urban river may still exchange pollen thanks to pollinator movements, and might therefore be regarded in management planning as potential connecting components between populations.

Honeybees (Apis mellifera) use optic flow information as an odometer to estimate distance travelled, but here we tested whether optic flow informs estimation of foraging costs also. Bees were trained to feeders in flight tunnels such that bees experienced the greatest optic flow en route to the feeder closest to the hive. Analyses of dance communication showed that, as expected, bees indicated the close feeder as being further, but they also indicated this feeder as the more profitable, and preferentially visited this feeder when given a choice. We show that honeybee estimates of foraging cost are not reliant on optic flow information. Rather, bees can assess distance and profitability independently and signal these aspects as separate elements of their dances. The optic flow signal is sensitive to the nature of the environment travelled by the bee, and is therefore not a good index of flight energetic costs, but it provides a good indication of distance travelled for purpose of navigation and communication, as long as the dancer and recruit travel similar routes.

Based on beekeepers' reports, honey bee losses in Italy follow a clear seasonal pattern: a) during spring and summer colonies lose many foragers due to agrochemicals (bee losses); b) from late summer to winter, the impact of pests (including Varroa) and pathogens becomes more important (colony losses).

However, their function within the motivational system remains unclear. I tested the hypothesis that displacement activities have a functional role during transitions between motivational states, using the honeybee model system. I observed a number of locomotory and grooming behaviours performed when foraging honeybees returned to the hive to dance. These focal behaviours occurred significantly more frequently during the period of transition from waggle dancing to exiting the hive to forage than during the periods before the waggle dance or during the waggle dance. By contrast, the control behaviour, trophallaxis, was distributed across time periods significantly differently, occurring with equal frequency in all periods. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that displacement activities have a functional role during motivational transitions. Evidence from other species suggests that the most likely function is facilitation, rather than inhibition, of the transition. The wide range of species in which displacement activities have been identified suggests that they are a universal feature of motivational control.

Our findings did not reveal clear evidence of degradation in genetic diversity of the extant Ashiu population compared to the museum specimens or to the Hyonosen population.

Corolla tube length was highly variable among the 15 study populations, and genetic differentiation among the populations (G(ST) = 0.360) was also highly significant. The differentiation in corolla tube length was explained by altitudinal difference, a proxy of the difference in pollinator assemblages.

Previous investigations predicted maximum foraging distances of 100-200 m for small bee species and up to 1100 m for very large species based on mainly indirect methods. The present study applied a new and direct approach to experimentally investigate maximum foraging distances in solitary bees. One endangered and two common species of different body sizes, all of which restrict pollen foraging to a single plant genus, were established in a landscape lacking their specific host plants. Females were forced to collect pollen on potted host plants that were successively placed in increasing distance from fixed nesting stands. The maximum foraging distance recorded for the small Hylaeus punctulatissimus was 1100 m, for the medium sized Chelostoma rapunculi 1275 m and for the large Hoplitis adunca 1400 m, indicating that maximum foraging distances at species level have been underestimated. However, the capability to use resources on such a large spatial scale applied only to a small percentage of individuals as 50% of the females of H. punctulatissimus and H. adunca did not forage at distances longer than 100-225 m and 300 m, respectively. This finding suggests that a close neighbourhood of nesting and foraging habitat within few hundred meters is crucial to maintain populations of these species, and that threshold distances at which half of the population discontinues foraging are a more meaningful parameter for conservation practice than the species specific maximum foraging distances.

By contrast, females nested close to the nearest conspecific nest. Size did not affect the dispersion patterns.

Nests of bumble bees are hardly found in nature. A prospective alternative is estimating the number of nests with polymorphic genetic data of individuals foraging in the field. Full-sib reconstruction from such genetic data is NP-hard in a strict sense, but several heuristic methods have been proposed. Among them, likelihood methods have been often applied for reconstructing full-sibs in nature, but they require relatively large sample sizes for obtaining accuracy in allele frequencies. Alternative methods calculate genetic distances between paired individuals and cluster them into family groups, but there are also pros and cons for applying these methods against real data. We proposed another heuristic pairing and clustering method, Shared Loci Correspondence Analysis (SLCA), for reconstructing full-sib families of haplodipoid populations. In SLCA, genetic similarities among individuals are numbers of loci shared by the paired individuals. The similarity scores are sorted by the correspondence analysis for clustering them into full-sib families. SLCA could be applicable to quite small samples and succeeded to correctly estimate the number of bumble bee nests in the field. We also improved estimation accuracy of SLCA by blunting the similarity index among individuals.

Very early after its commercial introduction, it was recognized that this species is invasive, can island hop to new locations and may disturb local ecosystems. The invasive characteristics of B. terrestris are: high migration ability, early seasonal emergence, high adaptability under adverse climatic conditions in various habitats, generalist or polylectic foraging strategies, enabling it to work a wide variety of flowers for resources, foraging over wide distances, a thermoregulatory metabolism that enables it to withstand low temperatures, no natural enemies to check population growth in areas outside its natural range, and it may develop two reproductive cycles in a year (bivoltine) in a newly colonized area. In addition, commercial bees produce more gynes and are better competitors than the local conspecific populations and may replace them in the likely event of an escape. The documented evidence on invasive impact of B. terrestris on natural ecosystems includes: negative interactions with local bee fauna, competition for nest sites with, and genetic contamination of, local Bombus spp., spread of parasites and pathogens and negative interactions with plant reproductive capacity.

The predominant form of agricultural land management in this region is crofting, a system specific to Scotland in which small agricultural units (crofts) operate rotational cropping and grazing regimes. Crofting is considered to be beneficial to a wide range of flora and fauna. However, currently there is a lack of quantitative evidence to support this view with regard to bumblebee populations. In this study we assessed the effect of land management on the abundance of foraging bumblebees and the availability of bumblebee forage plants across crofts in northwest Scotland. The results of our study show that current crofting practices do not support high densities of foraging bumblebees. Traditional crofting practice was to move livestock to uplands in the summer, but this has been largely abandoned. Summer sheep grazing of lowland pasture had a strong negative impact on bumblebee abundance and forage plant availability throughout the survey period. The use of specific 'bird and bee' conservation seed mixes appears to improve forage availability within the crofted landscape, although the number of bees observed remained low. Of the forage plants available, the three most frequently visited species were from the Fabaceae. We therefore conclude that the creation of agri-environment schemes which promote the use of Fabaceae-rich seed mixes and encourage the removal of sheep grazing on lowland areas throughout the summer are essential in order to conserve bumblebee populations within crofted areas.

This study examines genetic structure of Anelosimus studiosus, a spider exhibiting polymorphic social behaviour. Two phenotypes have been identified: an 'asocial' phenotype with solitary female nests and a 'social' phenotype with multi-female/communal nests. To address the questions of whether these phenotypes are differentiated populations and whether cooperative individuals are closely related, we used microsatellites to analyse individuals from both communal and solitary nests. We found no evidence of differentiation between social and solitary samples, implying high rates of interbreeding. This is consistent with the hypothesis that these phenotypes coexist as a behavioural polymorphism within populations. Pairwise relatedness coefficients were used to test whether cooperating individuals are more closely related than expected by chance. Pairwise relatedness of females sharing communal webs averaged 0.25, the level expected for half-siblings and significantly more closely related than random pairs from the population. Solitary females collected at similar distances to the communal spider pairs were also more closely related than expected by chance ( mean relatedness = 0.18), but less related than social pairs. These results imply that low dispersal contributes to increase likelihood of interaction between kin, but relatedness between social pairs is not explained by spatial structure alone. We propose that these phenotypes represent stages in the evolution of sociality, where viscous population structure creates opportunities for kin selection and cooperation is favoured under certain environmental conditions.",,,,,"Fordyce, James/0000-0002-2731-0418; Duncan, Sarah/0000-0003-4996-4540",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,FEB,2010,19,4,,,,,810,818,,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04523.x,,,,,,,WOS:000273953400016,20074313,,,,

Dispersal was measured by taking DNA samples from workers in the spring and summer, and from queens in the following spring, at 14 sites across a landscape. The queens captured in the spring must be full sisters of workers that were foraging in the previous year. A range of sibship reconstruction methods were compared using simulated data sets including or no genotyping errors. The program Colony gave the most accurate reconstruction and was used for our analysis of queen dispersal. Comparison of queen dispersion with worker foraging distances was used to take into account an expected low level of false identification of sister pairs which might otherwise lead to overestimates of dispersal. Our data show that Bombus pascuorum and B. lapidarius queens can disperse by at least 3 and 5 km, respectively. These estimates are consistent with inferences drawn from studies of population structuring in common and rare bumblebee species, and suggest that regular gene flow over several kilometres due to queen dispersal are likely to be sufficient to maintain genetic cohesion of ubiquitous species over large spatial scales whereas rare bumblebee species appear unable to regularly disperse over distances greater than 10 km.

Here, I evaluate a mathematical model of field-to-field gene flow due to insect pollination using parameter values appropriate to a large agricultural field of safflower. The model was solved based on laboratory pollination experiments and observations made on a large (40 ha) safflower field in Lethbridge, Canada that was pollinated by honey bees (Apis mellifera) and bumble bees (Bombus spp.). The model estimated the maximum feasible level of bee-mediated, field-to-field gene flow to range between 0.05% and 0.005% of seed set (95% upper confidence intervals of 0.23% and 0.023%), depending on the composition of the bee fauna. These relatively low values emerged for two reasons: safflower has a high capacity for automatic self-fertilization; and bees undertook long foraging bouts in the field, which made between-field pollinations relatively rare.

Within the context of ecotoxicology and insect physiology, we report the development of a new bioassay to assess the impact of sublethal concentrations on the bumblebee foraging behavior under laboratory conditions. In brief, the experimental setup of this behavior test consists of two artificial nests connected with a tube of about 20 cm and use of queenless micro-colonies of 5 workers. In one nest the worker bees constructed brood, and in the other food (sugar and pollen) was provided. Before exposure, the worker bees were allowed a training to forage for untreated food; afterwards this was replaced by treated food. Using this setup we investigated the effects of sublethal concentrations of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, known to negatively affect the foraging behavior of bees. For comparison within the family of neonicotinoid insecticides, we also tested different concentrations of two other neonicotinoids: thiamethoxam and thiacloprid, in the laboratory with the new bioassay. Finally to evaluate the new bioassay, we also tested sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid in the greenhouse with use of queenright colonies of B. terrestris, and here worker bees needed to forage/fly for food that was placed at a distance of 3 m from their hives. In general, the experiments showed that concentrations that may be considered safe for bumblebees can have a negative influence on their foraging behavior. Therefore it is recommended that behavior tests should be included in risk assessment tests for highly toxic pesticides because impairment of the foraging behavior can result in a decreased pollination, lower reproduction and finally in colony mortality due to a lack of food.",,,,"Serrano, Jose/A-2854-2009; Smagghe, Guy/AAE-8914-2019","Serrano, Jose/0000-0002-1565-5216; Smagghe, Guy/0000-0001-8334-3313",,,,,,,,,,,,0963-9292,,,,,JAN,2010,19,1,,,,,207,215,,10.1007/s10646-009-0406-2,,,,,,,WOS:000273032100020,19757031,,,,

Fruit set is, however, consistently low (8-36% range). The pollination efficiency of male and female blueberry bees was studied using: 1. comparison of pollen loads on foraging male and female bees; 2. calculation of pollen loads on fresh stigmas of flowers exposed to a single visit by a female bee; and 3. an experimental test of fruit and seed set following exposure to one to eight visits by both male and female bees. Females had larger pollen loads in four of five body regions, but male bees consistently carried pollen in quantities sufficient for fertilization. A single visit from a female bee resulted in mixed pollen deposition of 76 pollen grains, 20 of which were from Gelsemium and 56 from Vaccinium. There was no significant relationship of either fruit or seed set with number of visits from either males or females. Whilst both male and female bees are effective as pollen delivery agents of G. sempervirens, much of the pollen they deliver may be from the same floral morph, leading to rejection in this self-incompatible distylous species.

Two stimuli, with a mean wavelength of 40 nm perceptual distance, were chosen from the UV (340 nm vs 380 nm) and the green (510 nm vs 550 nm) range because these species are UV-green dichromats. Foragers were trained with two conditioning paradigms [absolute conditioning (AC) and differential conditioning (DC)]. In the UV range, C. aenescens foragers failed to discriminate when presented with a small colour difference in both training procedures. Foragers also failed in the green range when trained with AC but showed significant bias towards the rewarded stimulus when trained with DC. Formica cunicularia foragers achieved the task in the UV range when trained with DC only. In the green range, F. cunicularia foragers showed clear preference for the rewarded stimulus in both training conditioning procedures. Foragers never failed in choosing the rewarded stimulus in DC even when the intensity of the rewarded stimulus was reduced by one log unit.

Populations of both species showed significant structuring, and isolation by distance, but this was markedly greater in B. muscorum (theta = 0.13) than in B. jonellus (theta = 0.034). This difference could reflect a higher effective population size in B. jonellus compared to B. muscorum, but this is not consistent with the observed abundance of the two species.

Observational studies suggest that there are a set of conditions required for the production of toxic honey, but these factors have not been well studied. This research aims to investigate the importance of altitude and weather conditions for the production of toxic honey in New Zealand and makes some recommendations for a review of the New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA) Food (tutin in honey) Standard 2008 that was introduced after a toxic honey outbreak in 2008. Transects were established in parts of the North Island during the summer of 2009 and were visited weekly for 6 consecutive weeks. Variables recorded were elevation, S. australis density, honeydew abundance, honey bee and wasp (Vespula spp.) presence and temperature and rainfall data. Weather conditions present during the 2008 outbreak were compared with those from 1999 to 2009. S. australis were not present at altitudes of 375 m and above; with more research, some higher areas of New Zealand may be able to be reclassified as 'low risk'. Honeydew was available in a wide range of temperature and rainfall conditions. Rainfall appeared to wash honeydew from tutu bushes; however, it quickly reappeared in densely populated sites. Honey bee and wasp presence was positively affected by the presence of honeydew, nevertheless 30-50% of the time they were observed foraging in the absence of honeydew, indicating they may feed on small amounts of dew. As the absence of honeydew is an option given by the NZFSA to demonstrate honey safety, this requires investigation. Weather conditions leading up to the 2008 toxic honey outbreak were warm and dry but were not significantly different from other years. Therefore, inadequate management practices, rather than more favourable environmental conditions were probably responsible for the 2008 toxic honey outbreak. Future research should focus on determining the conditions required for toxic levels of honeydew to be incorporated into hives, and regions that have not produced toxic honey historically should be closely studied to determine whether any fit the low-risk criteria.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0114-0671,1175-8783,,,,,2010,38,2,,,,,87,100,,10.1080/01140671003781702,,,,,,,WOS:000279919000004,,,,,

We studied several aspects of its reproductive biology, including potential pollinators, floral biology, and diurnal and seasonal flowering phenology. Flower visitors were observed in G. tomentosum populations on O'ahu, Kaho'o-lawe, and Maui. Primary visitors were introduced species, honeybees and carpenter bees, both of which were pollinating the flowers. No native bee species were seen visiting flowers. In examining floral biology we found that in some cases 10% of flowers had styles that were as short as the anthers or were recurved toward the anthers. In the greenhouse, in the absence of pollinators, these flowers were the only ones that set fruit. Flowering of G. tomentosum commences in January and February, following the rainy season, peaks in May, and may continue into August and September. In one year, after higher than average precipitation during die rainy season, there was a greater abundance of flowering, and flowering persisted later into the year. Transgenic varieties of commercial cotton, G. hirsutum, are grown in Hawai'i and are interfertile with G. tomentosum. Honeybees and carpenter bees are also known pollinators of commercial cotton. Because these pollinators are long-distance foragers, we estimate that transgenic cotton fields would have to be greater than 10 kin from a G. to mentosum population to prevent gene flow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-8870,1534-6188,,,,JAN,2010,64,1,,,,,45,55,,10.2984/64.1.045,,,,,,,WOS:000273581200005,,,,,
J,"Van Rossum, F",,,,"Van Rossum, Fabienne",,,Reproductive success and pollen dispersal in urban populations of an insect-pollinated hay-meadow herb,PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Urban development increasingly occupies more landscape and is responsible for habitat alteration and fragmentation of so many ecosystems that urban environments can no longer be excluded from the areas to be considered in conservation strategies. Appropriate management measures ensuring population viability are needed, but due to the usually irreversible feature of the urbanisation process, the measure; may differ from non-urbanised areas. Sufficient gene flow levels, leading to successful seed production, appear to be a key element in the sustainable persistence of insect-pollinated plant remnant populations. This study investigated reproductive success and pollen dispersal patterns in Centaurea jacea, an insect-pollinated hay-meadow herb, in the Brussels urban area (Belgium). Reproductive performance of urban park populations was compared with populations occurring in urban semi-natural sites. Pollen dispersal patterns were examined within and among-population patches front two urban parks using fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Urban park populations showed a higher reproductive success than those in urban semi-natural sites. Depositions of fluorescent dye particles on recipient individuals were found within populations (< 20 m), among populations within parks (over a few hundred meters) and among parks (maximal investigated distance: 2.6 km), indicating pollinator movements and a potential gene flow by pollen over relatively long distances. Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution with respect to spatial distance. The very small populations received more immigrant dye deposition when located at short distances from the source population. These findings demonstrate that urban populations do not perform worse in reproductive success than populations from agricultural landscapes, despite their small size, and can function as a network exchanging pollen. The conversion of urban park lawns into interconnected networks of ecologically managed hay meadows, allowing simultaneous flowering and seed production in many patches of target species, is to be strongly encouraged.

Samples were mineralized using microwave method. Quantitative analysis of studied metals in bees' bodies and multiflower honey were done using the plasma spectrometry method (ICP). It was found that copper was an clement present in bodies of worker bees in the highest concentration. Its mean content was 22.6 mg.kg(-1) d.m.

However, site switching between patches tends to occur with low frequency while a given patch is still rewarding, thus reducing pollen dispersal and gene flow between patches. In principle, forager switching and gene flow between patches could be higher when close patches offer similar rewards. We investigated site switching during food recruitment in the stingless bee Scaptotrigona mexicana. Thus, we trained three groups of foragers to three feeders in different locations, one group per location. These groups did not interact each other during the training phase. Next, interaction among trained foragers was allowed. We found that roughly half of the foragers switched sites, the other half remaining faithful to its training feeder. Switching is influenced by the presence of recruitment information. In the absence of recruitment information (bees visiting and recruiting for feeders), employed foragers were site specific. Foragers only switched among feeders that were being visited and recruited to. Switching was not caused by learned aversion to experimental handling. Switching in response to recruitment could provide a fitness benefit to the colony by facilitating rapid switching among exploited patches and provide a benefit of increasing plant gene flow between patches.",,,,"Sanchez, Daniel/Q-1872-2018; Nieh, James/H-8705-2014; Trejo, Yesenia YGTA/D-9257-2012","Sanchez, Daniel/0000-0003-1261-5320; Nieh, James/0000-0001-6237-0726; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0179-1613,1439-0310,,,,DEC,2009,115,12,,,,,1175,1181,,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2009.01703.x,,,,,,,WOS:000271631600006,,,,,

By doing this the workers maximize their expected longevity, because tasks inside the nest are safe and tasks outside the nest are risky. The optimal strategy of workers should be expected to depend not only on their age but also on their health status if it is associated with reduction of longevity. Here a mathematical model is used to calculate the optimal time of switching between safe and risky tasks in a colony consisting of both healthy and unhealthy workers. The model predicts that unhealthy workers, with shorter longevity, should perform more risky tasks at an earlier age than their healthy nest mates should. The optimal time to switch between safe and risky tasks depends on the proportion of healthy and unhealthy workers in the colony, but the workers need not perceive the health status of their nest mates in order to adopt the optimal strategy. The workers need only perceive their own life expectancy, because the life expectancy of healthy and unhealthy workers should be the same at the time of switching from safe to risky tasks.

In particular, better knowledge of which habitats bees utilize for foraging over their lifetime would inform a range of applied and theoretical questions Traditional methods of studying foraging are either impractical for insects (e.g. radio tracking) or else are limited spatially or temporally (e g. observations by researchers). Here we describe a method for using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen from bee tissues to gain an integrated signal of which habitats a bee has foraged in over its lifetime, using three species of social stingless bee (Apidae: Meliponini) in a fragmented tropical forest landscape in southern Costa Rica as a test case. There were strongly significant differences in the carbon and nitrogen isotope signals of bees collected in the landscape extremes: the largest forests and largest open pastures in the region We could not estimate proportions of dietary carbon and nitrogen derived from different habitats. however, due to the high sample variance. Still, isotope ratios reflect a signature of the habitat that a bee has foraged in, and we found significant relationships between foraging patterns and season, landscape context (proportion of forest surrounding sample sites) and local biotic context (bee and plant diversity and abundance). Landscape context was the most consistent factor among the analyses, in line with the idea that meliponines do not preferentially forage in deforested habitats. Bee and plant diversity and abundance showed various significant relationships with the isotopic values of the different species. but the patterns were inconsistent. These results are potentially consistent with habitat switching from pasture to forest in areas of greater competition, but the extreme spatiotemporal variability in resource density likely blurs these patterns.

In this study, we investigated the value of hedgerows as foraging habitat for native bees in mosaics of small-scale agriculture and natural vegetation in two riparian landscapes in southeast Arizona, USA. In the summers of 2002 and 2003, we surveyed bees and flowers in four habitats: hedgerows, agricultural fields, woodlots, and native woodland. We asked: (1) How do hedgerows compare to other available habitats in bee abundance and species richness? (2) How does bee species composition in hedgerows compare to species composition in agricultural fields and woodland? (3) How do flower resources in hedgerows compare to those in fields and woodland? We found that hedgerows were attractive foraging habitat for native bees, especially in early summer, when hedgerows tended to have higher species richness than other agricultural or natural habitats. Cumulative species richness was highest in agricultural fields, although cumulative species richness did not significantly differ among fields, hedgerows, and woodland. While bee faunas overlapped among habitats, bee assemblages in hedgerows were more similar to those in woodland than to those in fields. The hedgerow herbaceous flora was roughly intermediate to that of fields and woodland; hedgerows also supported high densities of woodland-characteristic shrubs. These flowering shrubs were important in attracting bees that were otherwise uncommon in the landscape, including some species that are potentially valuable pollinators of agricultural crops.

It thus plays a major role in pollinator floral constancy and plant gene flow. Honeybees are the primary model for pollinator associative learning, but bumblebees play an important ecological role in a wider range of habitats, and their associative learning abilities are less well understood. We assayed learning with the proboscis extension reflex (PER), using a novel method for restraining bees (capsules) designed to improve bumblebee learning. We present the first results demonstrating that bumblebees exhibit the memory spacing effect. They improve their associative learning of odor and nectar reward by exhibiting increased memory acquisition, a component of long-term memory formation, when the time interval between rewarding trials is increased. Bombus impatiens forager memory acquisition (average discrimination index values) improved by 129% and 65% at inter-trial intervals (ITI) of 5 and 3 min, respectively, as compared to an ITI of 1 min. Memory acquisition rate also increased with increasing ITI. Encapsulation significantly increases olfactory memory acquisition. Ten times more foragers exhibited at least one PER response during training in capsules as compared to traditional PER harnesses. Thus, a novel conditioning assay, encapsulation, enabled us to improve bumblebee-learning acquisition and demonstrate that spaced learning results in better memory consolidation.

Linum cratericola (Linaceae) was first discovered in 1966 at two sites on Floreana Island, Galapagos. It has since disappeared from one site and survives in three groups of plants at the other, where it has been threatened with extinction by introduced ungulates and invasive plants. Population size, and growth rate and mortality of individual plants, have been monitored since 1997. The population appears highly responsive to changes in threat levels: the three plant groups increased rapidly following protection by fencing and ungulate control, but temporarily declined when feral goat pressure increased and during dry periods. Natural factors that may contribute to population limitation include dry years, grazing by native snails and competition from native vascular plants and cryptogams. Linum cratericola has a single flowering period per year and produces abundant seed with 28% germination after scarification, but with no obvious adaptations for long-distance dispersal. Potential pollinators included the butterfly Leptotes parrhasioides, the hoverfly Toxomerus crockeri and the carpenter bee Xylocopa darwinii, all endemic to Galapagos. The continued survival of L. cratericola in the wild depends on effective protection from introduced herbivores and invasive plants.

Tim; Mangel, Marc; Estes, James A.",,,"Learning to be different: acquired skills, social learning, frequency dependence, and environmental variation can cause behaviourally mediated foraging specializations",EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Question: How does the ability to improve foraging skills by learning, and to transfer that learned knowledge, affect the development of intra-population foraging specializations? Features of the model: We use both a state-dependent life-history model implemented by stochastic dynamic programming (SDPM) and an individual-based model (IBM) to capture the dynamic nature of behavioural preferences in feeding. Variables in the SDPM include energy reserves, skill levels, energy and handling time per single prey item, metabolic rate, the rates at which skills are learned and forgotten, the effect of skills on handling time, and the relationship between energy reserves and fitness. Additional variables in the IBM include the probability of successful weaning, the logistic dynamics of the prey species with stochastic recruitment, the intensity of top-down control of prey by predators, the mean and variance in skill levels of new recruits, and the extent to which learned information can be transmitted via matrilineal social learning. Key range of variables: We explore the effects of approaching the time horizon in the SDPM, changing the extent to which skills can improve with experience, increasing the rates of learning or forgetting of skills, changing whether the learning curve is constant, accelerating ('J'-shaped) or decelerating ('r'-shaped), changing both mean and maximum possible energy reserves, changing metabolic costs of foraging, and changing the rate of encounter with prey. Conclusions: The model results show that the following factors increase the degree of prey specialization observed in a predator population: (1) Experience handling a prey type can substantially improve foraging skills for that prey. (2) There is limited ability to retain complex learned skills for multiple prey types. (3) The learning curve for acquiring new foraging skills is accelerating, or J-shaped. (4) The metabolic costs of foraging are high relative to available energy reserves. (5) Offspring can learn foraging skills from their mothers (matrilineal social learning). (6) Food abundance is limited, such that average individual energy reserves are low Additionally, the following factors increase the likelihood of alternative specializations co-occurring in a predator population: (1) The predator exerts effective top-down control of prey abundance, resulting in frequency-dependent dynamics. (2) There is stochastic variation in prey population dynamics, but this variation is neither too extreme in magnitude nor too 'slow' with respect to the time required for an individual forager to learn new foraging skills. For a given predator population, we deduce that the degree of specialization will be highest for those prey types requifing complex capture or handling skills, while prey species that are both profitable and easy to capture and handle will be included in the diet of all individuals. Frequency-dependent benefits of selecting alternative prey types, combined with the ability of foragers to improve their foraging skills by learning, and transmit learned skills to offspring, can result in behaviourally mediated foraging specialization, and also lead to the co-existence of alternative specializations. The extent of such specialization is predicted to be a variable trait, increasing in locations or years when intra-specific competition is high relative to inter-specific competition.",,,,"Tinker, Martin/F-1277-2011; Tinker, Martin/D-3249-2018","Tinker, Martin/0000-0002-3314-839X",,,,,,,,,,,,1522-0613,,,,,SEP,2009,11,6,,,,,841,869,,,,,,,,,WOS:000271083600001,,,,,

While foraging individually over distances of many thousand times their body lengths in featureless as well as cluttered terrain, they navigate predominantly by visual means using vector navigation (path integration) and landmark-guidance mechanisms as well as systematic-search and target-expansion strategies as their main navigational tools. In vector navigation they employ several ways of acquiring information about directions steered (compass information) and distances covered (odometer information). In landmark guidance they rely on view-based information about visual scenes obtained at certain vantage points and combined with certain steering (motor) commands of what to do next. By exploring how these various navigational routines interact, the current position paper provides a hypothesis of what the architecture of the ant's navigational toolkit might look like. The hypothesis is built on the assumption that the toolkit consists of a number of domain-specific routines. Even though these routines are quite rigidly preordained (and get modified during the ant's lifetime by strictly task-dependent, rapid learning processes), they interact quite flexibly in various, largely context-dependent ways. However, they are not suited to provide the ant with cartographic information about the locations of places within the animal's foraging environment. The navigational toolkit does not seem to contain a central integration state in which local landmark memories are embedded in a global system of metric coordinates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-4136,,,,,SEP,2009,12,,,,,,85,96,,,,,,,,,WOS:000271357700010,,,,,

This study examined within- and between-population pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue, and genetic variation and structure using 15 allozyme loci in Centaurium erythraea, an insect-pollinated, early-successional forest biennial herb occurring in a peri-urban forest (Brussels urban zone, Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with most dye transfers occurring at short distances (< 15 m), and only a few long-distance events (up to 743 m). Flowers of C. erythraea are mainly visited by Syrphids (Diptera) and small bees, which are usually considered as short-distance pollen dispersers, and occasionally by bumblebees, which are usually longer-distance pollen dispersers. Small and large dye source populations differed in dye deposition patterns. The populations showed low genetic diversity, high inbreeding coefficients (F-IS) and high genetic differentiation (F-ST), suggesting restricted gene flow, which can be expected for an early-successional biennial species with a predominantly selfing breeding system and fluctuating population sizes. The positive relationship between recruitment rate and allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, and the absence of significant correlations between genetic variation and population size suggest seedling recruitment from the seed bank, contributing to maintain genetic diversity. Long-distance dye dispersal events indicate pollinator movements along urban forest path and road verges. These landscape elements might therefore have a potential conservation value by contributing to connectivity of early-successional species populations located in patchy open habitats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1435-8603,1438-8677,,,,SEP,2009,11,5,,,,,725,737,,10.1111/j.1438-8677.2008.00176.x,,,,,,,WOS:000268793400010,19689780,,,,

However, little is known about their effects on gene flow via pollen dispersal between populations of these species. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a 2-year experiment, we observed effective pollen dispersal from source populations of Centaurea jacea in restored meadows, the most widespread Swiss agri-environment scheme, to potted plants in adjacent intensively managed meadows without other individuals of this species. Potted plants were put in replicated source populations at 25, 50, 100 m and where possible 200 m distance from these source populations. Pollen transfer among isolated plants was prevented by temporary bagging, such that only one isolated plant was accessible for flower visitors at any one time. Because C. jacea is self-incompatible, seed set in single-plant isolates indicated insect mediated effective pollen dispersal from the source population. Seed set was higher in source populations (35.7 +/- 4.4) than in isolates (4.8 +/- 1.0). Seed set declined from 18.9% of that in source populations at a distance of 25 m to 7.4% at 200 m. At a distance of 200 m seed set was still significantly higher in selfed plants, indicating long-distance effective pollen dispersal up to 200 m. Analyses of covariance suggested that bees contributed more than flies to this long-distance pollen dispersal. We found evidence that pollen dispersal to single-plant isolates was positively affected by the diversity and flower abundance of neighboring plant species in the intensively managed meadow. Furthermore, the decline of the dispersal was less steep when the source population of C. jacea was large. Conclusions: We conclude that insect pollinators can effectively transfer pollen from source populations of C. jacea over at least 200 m, even when ""recipient populations'' consisted of single-plant isolates, suggesting that gene flow by pollen over this distance is very likely. Source population size and flowering environment surrounding recipient plants appear to be important factors affecting pollen dispersal in C. jacea. It is conceivable that most insect-pollinated plants in a network of restored sites within intensively managed grassland can form metapopulations, if distances between sites are of similar magnitude as tested here.",,,,"Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,Aug-25,2009,4,8,,,,,,,e6751,10.1371/journal.pone.0006751,,,,,,,WOS:000269278400016,19707542,,,,

Management of lowland mesotrophic grasslands in north-west Europe often makes use of inorganic fertilizers, high stocking densities and silage-based forage systems to maximize productivity. The impact of these practices has resulted in a simplification of the plant community combined with wide-scale declines in the species richness of grassland invertebrates. We aim to identify how field margin management can be used to promote invertebrate diversity across a suite of functionally diverse taxa (beetles, planthoppers, true bugs, butterflies, bumblebees and spiders). 2. Using an information theoretic approach we identify the impacts of management (cattle grazing, cutting and inorganic fertilizer) and plant community composition (forb species richness, grass species richness and sward architecture) on invertebrate species richness and body size. As many of these management practices are common to grassland systems throughout the world, understanding invertebrate responses to them is important for the maintenance of biodiversity. 3. Sward architecture was identified as the primary factor promoting increased species richness of both predatory and phytophagous trophic levels, as well as being positively correlated with mean body size. In all cases phytophagous invertebrate species richness was positively correlated with measures of plant species richness. 4. The direct effects of management practices appear to be comparatively weak, suggesting that their impacts are indirect and mediated though the continuous measures of plant community structure, such as sward architecture or plant species richness. 5. Synthesis and applications. By partitioning field margins from the remainder of the field, economically viable intensive grassland management can be combined with extensive management aimed at promoting native biodiversity. The absence of inorganic fertilizer, combined with a reduction in the intensity of both cutting and grazing regimes, promotes floral species richness and sward architectural complexity. By increasing sward architecture the total biomass of invertebrates also increased (by c. 60% across the range of sward architectural measures seen in this study), increasing food available for higher trophic levels, such as birds and mammals.",,,,"Woodcock, Benjamin Alex/F-9199-2010; Potts, Simon G/C-7250-2008; Tscheulin, T./B-9722-2011","Woodcock, Benjamin Alex/0000-0003-0300-9951; Potts, Simon G/0000-0002-2045-980X; Tscheulin, T./0000-0002-9901-1521",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,AUG,2009,46,4,,,,,920,929,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01675.x,,,,,,,WOS:000267706000022,,,,,

F.; Darvill, Ben; Goulson, Dave",,,Impacts of inbreeding on bumblebee colony fitness under field conditions,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: Inbreeding and the loss of genetic diversity are known to be significant threats to small, isolated populations. Hymenoptera represent a special case regarding the impact of inbreeding. Haplodiploidy may permit purging of deleterious recessive alleles in haploid males, meaning inbreeding depression is reduced relative to diploid species. In contrast, the impact of inbreeding may be exacerbated in Hymenopteran species that have a single-locus complementary sex determination system, due to the production of sterile or inviable diploid males. We investigated the costs of brother-sister mating in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We compared inbred colonies that produced diploid males and inbred colonies that did not produce diploid males with outbred colonies. Mating, hibernation and colony founding took place in the laboratory. Once colonies had produced 15 offspring they were placed in the field and left to forage under natural conditions. Results: The diploid male colonies had a significantly reduced fitness compared to regular inbred and outbred colonies; they had slower growth rates in the laboratory, survived for a shorter time period under field conditions and produced significantly fewer offspring overall. No differences in success were found between non-diploid male inbred colonies and outbred colonies. Conclusion: Our data illustrate that inbreeding exacts a considerable cost in Bombus terrestris through the production of diploid males. We suggest that diploid males may act as indicators of the genetic health of populations, and that their detection could be used as an informative tool in hymenopteran conservation. We conclude that whilst haplodiploids may suffer less inbreeding depression than diploid species, they are still highly vulnerable to population fragmentation and reduced genetic diversity due to the extreme costs imposed by the production of diploid males.",,,,"Brown, Mark/E-7644-2010; Goulson, David/A-2462-2010; Tinsley, Matthew/S-9707-2018","Goulson, David/0000-0003-4421-2876; Tinsley, Matthew/0000-0002-7715-1259; Whitehorn, Penelope/0000-0001-9852-1012",,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2148,,,,,Jul-02,2009,9,,,,,,,,152,10.1186/1471-2148-9-152,,,,,,,WOS:000268674500001,19573223,,,,

We trained foragers of the stingless bee Melipona mandacaia to feeders in their native habitat under natural conditions, and found that larger foragers forage at and recruit to significantly greater distances than smaller foragers. The maximum foraging and recruitment distances are significantly greater ( by 24% and 48% respectively) for larger as compared to smaller foragers. We also provide the first direct evidence that stingless bees can forage in their native habitat at distances up to 2.1 km and recruit over 1 km from their nest, recruiting more than 230% farther than previously reported for any stingless bee feeder experiments. Natural size variation among colonies within the same species may play a role in foraging range, and could thus influence plant gene flow and population structure.",,,,"Nieh, James/H-8705-2014; Contrera, Felipe/D-2952-2009","Nieh, James/0000-0001-6237-0726; Contrera, Felipe/0000-0002-7078-5048",,,,,,,,,,,,0044-8435,1297-9678,,,,JUL-AUG,2009,40,4,,,,,472,480,,10.1051/apido/2009007,,,,,,,WOS:000267832900006,,,,,

To date research in this area has focused on how invasive plant species affect pollinator behaviour, but there is a lack of data on the impact that alien plant species have on wild pollinator populations. Since their introduction in the 19th century, and rapid spread after the 1950s, alien goldenrods (Solidago canadensis, Solidago gigantea) have been among the most successful invasive plant species in Europe. We studied the effects of goldenrods on wild pollinator communities in SE Poland. The abundance, species richness and diversity of wild bees, hoverflies and butterflies were compared between wet meadows invaded by goldenrod (10 transects) and non-invaded controls (10 transects). Furthermore, we compared the plant diversity and average cover between the two groups of sites. Invasion of goldenrods had a very strong negative effect on wild pollinator diversity as well as abundance. Plant diversity and average cover were also negatively affected by goldenrod invasion. Wild pollinators were grouped according to their nesting and food specialization, but none were resistant to the invasion, indicating that introduced goldenrod may affect the entire wild pollinator community. Our study emphasises the urgent need to develop specific protection plans for wild pollinators in habitats threatened by foreign plants and we call for the introduction of programs to stop the invasion of goldenrod not only in Poland, but also on a continental scale.

Furthermore, such species are typically among the last in a community to reestablish due to their reliance upon lower trophic level resources and a requirement for persistent, stable ecological conditions. Consequently their presence alone can be indicative of healthy ecosystems. Using replicated, quantitative food webs we studied the impacts of a restoration treatment upon the interactions of a tri-trophic community consisting of plants, their bumble bee pollinators, and the parasites, parasitoids, and pathogens of the bumble bees at heathland sites. We found the lower trophic levels of the community successfully reinstated at restored relative to control sites. However the abundance, load per host, prevalence of parasitism, prevalence of superparasitism, and host range of a key dipteran parasitoid of the family Conopidae were all significantly reduced in restored heathlands. Potential causes for this incomplete reestablishment at restored sites include the lag in floral resources due to differences in. oral species composition, and the reduced ability of this parasitoid species in accessing host resources relative to other natural enemy species present in these communities. Moreover the incomplete reinstatement of the natural enemy community was found to significantly reduce levels of network vulnerability (a measure of how vulnerable prey is to being consumed) at restored sites relative to ancient, control networks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,JUL,2009,90,7,,,,,1840,1851,,10.1890/07-2108.1,,,,,,,WOS:000267745800014,19694133,,,,

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Primula vulgaris Huds. (Primrose) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles : distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Primula vulgaris is a native perennial herb with a very wide distribution in the British Isles. In many lowland areas it is essentially a plant of woodlands and hedgerows, although in the west it can occur abundantly in grasslands and other communities such as heaths. In northern and western Britain and Ireland, it may be frequent in open and even exposed habitats. Its distribution is linked with soil moisture and atmospheric humidity. It is shade tolerant, but it flowers most profusely in canopy gaps. 3. Primula vulgaris is a rosette hemicryptophyte that reproduces mainly through seeds. Vegetative spread is restricted and only occurs within very short distances from the mother plant through the production of lateral rosettes. Although individual rosettes may die, plants are relatively long-lived (life expectancy of a newborn individual: 48.3 years). The mean age at first flowering was 20 months. 4. Pollination is mainly by bumblebees and other bees, but other long-tongued pollinators including syrphids, bee-flies and even butterflies may be locally important. P. vulgaris is an obligate outbreeder, with two genetically determined self-incompatible morphs ('pin' and 'thrum'). A third morph ('homostyle' or 'long homostyle'), with a stigma like that of pin but anthers like that of thrum, has been found in Somerset and North Dorset. In years when pollinators are scarce, homostyles have higher reproductive success than pins and thrums, suggesting that reproductive assurance could have had a profound effect on the evolution of homostyly in P. vulgaris. 5. Seeds are dispersed by ants and rodents. Dispersal is usually restricted to a few centimetres or decimetres from maternal plants, resulting in significant fine-scale spatial genetic structure and small neighbourhood sizes. Pollen flow, on the other hand, is more extensive, but still limited to a few metres from paternal plants. 6. Populations of P. vulgaris have not changed markedly during the last century in most parts of Britain and Ireland and it is not threatened with extinction nationally. However, there is evidence that Primroses were formerly more widespread and have decreased with the decline of coppicing and pollarding. In East Anglia, woodland populations have declined greatly in response to a series of hot, dry summers since 1970. Small, isolated populations of P. vulgaris often show reduced reproductive success, potentially affecting their long-term survival. Preservation of local habitat conditions and restoration of gene flow among populations are required to maintain viable populations of P. vulgaris in the long term.",,,,"Jacquemyn, Hans/AAC-4875-2019; Hermy, Martin/A-3769-2009","Jacquemyn, Hans/0000-0001-9600-5794; Hermy, Martin/0000-0002-5403-0139",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,,,,,JUL,2009,97,4,,,,,812,833,,10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01513.x,,,,,,,WOS:000267071500022,,,,,

These detritus decorations have been hypothesised to camouflage the spider from predators or prey and thus reduce predation risk or increase foraging success. In the present study, we tested these two alternative hypotheses simultaneously using two types of detritus decorations (prey remain and egg sac) built by Cyclosa mulmeinensis (Thorell). By monitoring the possible responses of predators to spiders on their webs with and without decorations in the field, we tested whether web decorations would reduce the mortality of spiders. Wasp predators were observed to fly in the vicinity of webs with decorations slightly more often than in the vicinity of webs without decorations but there were very few attacks on spiders by wasps. By comparing the insect interception rates of webs with and without decorations in the field, we tested whether web decorations would increase the foraging success. Webs decorated with prey remains or egg sacs intercepted more insects than those without in the field. By calculating colour contrasts of both prey-remain and egg-sac decorations against spiders viewed by bird (blue tits) and hymenopteran (e. g. wasps) predators as well as hymenopteran (bees) prey, we showed that C. mulmeinensis spiders on webs with egg-sac decorations were invisible to both hymenopteran prey and predators and bird predators over short and long distances. While spiders on webs with prey-remain decorations were invisible to both hymenopterans and birds over short distances, spiders on webs with prey-remain decorations were visible to both predators and prey over long distances. Our results thus suggest that decorating webs with prey remains and egg sacs in C. mulmeinensis may primarily function as camouflage to conceal the spider from insects rather than as prey attractants, possibly contributing to the interception of more insect prey. However, the detritus decorations exhibit varying success as camouflage against predators, depending on whether predators are jumping spiders, wasps or birds, as well as on the decoration type.",,,,"Tan, Eunice/H-8404-2012; Tan, Eunice Jingmei/Q-3500-2019; Li, Daiqin/D-6922-2013","Li, Daiqin/0000-0001-8269-7734; Tan, Eunice/0000-0003-1667-3958",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,Jun-15,2009,212,12,,,,,1832,1839,,10.1242/jeb.030502,,,,,,,WOS:000266456300017,19483001,,,,

Many use changing signals as indicators that visitation and/or pollination have occurred (2, 3]). Floral color change is commonly used to transmit this information [3-7] (often correlated with reduced nectar reward [8, 9]) and can be specifically triggered by pollination or visitation. By retaining color-changed flowers, plants benefit from larger floral displays but also indicate at close range which flowers are still rewarding (and still unpollinated), so that visitors forage more efficiently [5, 6]. However, the legume Desmodium setigerum shows a unique ability, if inadequately pollinated, to reverse its flowers' color and shape changes. Single visits by bees mechanically depress the keel and expose stigma and anthers (termed ""tripping""); visits also initiate a rapid color change from lilac to white and turquoise and a slower morphological change, the upper petal folding downwards over the reproductive parts. But flowers receiving insufficient pollen can partially reopen, re-exposing the stigma, with a further color change to deeper turquoise and/or lilac. Thus, most flowers achieve pollination from one bee visit, but those with inadequate pollen receipt can reverse their signals, earning a ""second chance"" by eliciting attention from other potential pollinators.",,,,"Stanley, Dara/K-2295-2012","Stanley, Dara/0000-0001-8948-8409",,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,1879-0445,,,,Jun-09,2009,19,11,,,,,919,923,,10.1016/j.cub.2009.03.070,,,,,,,WOS:000266891900025,19409788,,,,

We investigated the foraging behavior of pollinators, especially Osmia cornifrons Radoszkowski, in order to evaluate their use instead of honeybees. O. cornifrons showed strong flower constancy for 4-8 min during one pollen-nectar foraging trip, as observed in honeybees. However, the bees seemed to forage for different types of flowers, e.g. from a red to a white petal color, during their 16-22 pollen-nectar foraging trips based on the S-RNase allele and simple sequence repeat (SSR) analyses of pollen loaves made during those trips. After one pollen-nectar foraging trip, the bees brushed their abdomen with their hind legs at a nester tube, but ca. 10% of pollen was not brushed from their bodies. The remaining pollen on the body retained the ability for the fertilization of apple for 12 days, suggesting that the pollen on the pollinator's body from a pollinizer could be used for the fertilization of a commercial cultivar visited on their next foraging trip. O. cornifrons seems to be a useful pollinator in apple orchards consisting of a single cultivar, such as, 'Fuji', and of pollinizers of different types, such as the red petal color type, 'Maypole' or 'Makamik'. Moreover, most pollen loaves investigated contained S-28-RNase allele, which was specific for pollen of 'Starking Delicious' planted at a great distance (55.2 m) from the nestiny shelter, suggesting that O. cornifrons is a useful pollinator for 'Delicious', which is difficult for honeybees to use as a pollinator for its sideworking behavior.

J,"Ohashi, K; Thomson, JD",,,,"Ohashi, Kazuharu; Thomson, James D.",,,"Trapline foraging by pollinators: its ontogeny, economics and possible consequences for plants",ANNALS OF BOTANY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Trapline foraging (repeated sequential visits to a series of feeding locations) has been often observed in pollinators collecting nectar or pollen from flowers. Although field studies on bumble-bees and hummingbirds have clarified fundamental aspects of this behaviour, trapline foraging still poses several difficult questions from the perspectives of both animals and plants. These questions include whether and how traplining improves foraging performance, how animals develop traplines with accumulating foraging experience, and how traplining affects pollen flow or plant reproduction. First, we review our previous work performed by using computer simulations and indoor flight-cage experiments with bumble-bees foraging from arrays of automated feeders. Our findings include the following: (1) traplining benefits foragers that are competing for resources that replenish in a decelerating way, (2) traplining is a learned behaviour that develops over a period of hours and (3) the establishment of traplines could be hampered by spatial configuration of plants such as zigzags. Second, using a simulation model linking pollinator movement and pollen transfer, we consider how service by pollinators with different foraging patterns (searchers or trapliners) would affect pollen flow. Traplining increases mating distance and mate diversity, and reduces 'iterogamy' (self-pollination caused by return visits) at the population level. Furthermore, increased visitation rates can have opposite effects on the reproductive success of a plant, depending on whether the visitors are traplining or searching. Finally, we discuss possible consequences of traplining for plants in the light of new experimental work and modelling. We suggest that trapline foraging by pollinators increases variation among plant populations in genetic diversity, inbreeding depression and contributions of floral traits to plant fitness, which should in turn affect the rates and directions of floral evolution. More theoretical and empirical studies are needed to clarify possible outcomes of such a neglected side of pollination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,,,,,JUN,2009,103,9,,,,,1365,1378,,10.1093/aob/mcp088,,,,,,,WOS:000266497800002,19398446,,,,

Ensuring the maintenance of the service requires a full understanding of the contributions of landscape elements to pollinator populations and crop pollination. Here, the first quantitative model that predicts pollinator abundance on a landscape is described and tested. Using information on pollinator nesting resources, floral resources and foraging distances, the model predicts the relative abundance of pollinators within nesting habitats. From these nesting areas, it then predicts relative abundances of pollinators on the farms requiring pollination services. Model outputs are compared with data from coffee in Costa Rica, watermelon and sunflower in California and watermelon in New Jersey-Pennsylvania (NJPA). Results from Costa Rica and California, comparing field estimates of pollinator abundance, richness or services with model estimates, are encouraging, explaining up to 80 % of variance among farms. However, the model did not predict observed pollinator abundances on NJPA, so continued model improvement and testing are necessary. The inability of the model to predict pollinator abundances in the NJPA landscape may be due to not accounting for fine-scale floral and nesting resources within the landscapes surrounding farms, rather than the logic of our model. The importance of fine-scale resources for pollinator service delivery was supported by sensitivity analyses indicating that the model's predictions depend largely on estimates of nesting and floral resources within crops.

Adults and larvae feed on pollen, honey, and brood in bee hives. The beetle is also able to feed and reproduce on fresh or rotting fruit, but natural occurrence on this diet has rarely been observed. We compared the reproductive success-as measured by progeny production, weight of progeny, developmental rate, and survival of immature stages-of beetles reared on various diets of fruit and bee products. Reproduction on all of the diets was sufficient for population growth. Using baited flight traps to monitor the presence of A. tumida, we found persistent although tenuous populations in wooded habitats lacking managed bee colonies. On the basis of these findings and the habits of other nitidulid beetles, we propose that A. tumida is an ecological generalist able to maintain adequate levels of reproduction in marginal environments but able to reach high levels in favorable, resource rich environments, such as honey bee colonies. This hypothesis has significance for active dispersal and range expansion, because reproduction in the absence of bees would facilitate long range dispersal by flight through successive generations.

J,"Elliott, SE",,,,"Elliott, Susan E.",,,Subalpine Bumble Bee Foraging Distances and Densities in Relation to Flower Availability,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bees feed almost exclusively on nectar and pollen from flowers. However, little is known about how food availability limits bee populations, especially in high elevation areas. Foraging distances and relationships between forager densities and resource availability can provide insights into the potential for food limitation in mobile consumer populations. For example, if floral resources are limited, bee consumers should fly farther to forage, and they should be more abundant in areas with more flowers. I estimated subalpine bumble bee foraging distances by calculating forager recapture probabilities at increasing distances from eight marking locations. I measured forager and flower densities over the flowering season in six half-hectare plots. Because subalpine humble bees have little time to build their colonies, they may forage over short distances and forager density may not be constrained by flower density. However, late in the season, when floral resources dwindle, foraging distances may increase, and there may be stronger relationships between forager and flower densities. Throughout the flowering season, marked bees were primarily found within 100 in (and never >1,000 m) from their original marking location, Suggesting that they typically did not fly far to forage.

Megachilines use resins, masticated leaves, trichomes and other plant materials sometimes along with mud to construct nests in cavities or in soil. Among these, the leafcutter bees (Megachile s.l.) are the most famous for their behaviour to line their brood cells with discs cut from various plants. We report on fossil records of one body fossil of a new non-leafcutting megachiline and of 12 leafcuttings from three European sites-Eckfeld and Messel, both in Germany (Eocene), and Menat, France (Paleocene). The excisions include the currently earliest record of probable Megachile activity and suggest the presence of such bees in the Paleocene European fauna. Comparison with extant leafcuttings permits the interpretation of a minimal number of species that produced these excisions. The wide range of size for the leafcuttings indirectly might suggest at least two species of Megachile for the fauna of Messel in addition to the other megachiline bee described here. The presence of several cuttings on most leaves from Eckfeld implies that the preferential foraging behaviour of extant Megachile arose early in megachiline evolution. These results demonstrate that combined investigation of body and trace fossils complement each other in understanding past biodiversity, the latter permitting the detection of taxa not otherwise directly sampled and inferences on behavioural evolution.",,,,"Wappler, Torsten/P-6831-2019; Wappler, Torsten/D-4287-2011; Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Wappler, Torsten/0000-0003-1592-0988; Wappler, Torsten/0000-0003-1592-0988; Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X; Wedmann, Sonja/0000-0002-9778-4125",,,,,,,,,,,,0028-1042,,,,,JUN,2009,96,6,,,,,703,712,,10.1007/s00114-009-0525-x,,,,,,,WOS:000266093000005,19296064,,,,

Of this group, Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata (CCV) is widespread in south-eastern Queensland and northern New South Wales. It is currently the most commonly harvested native hardwood in Queensland. However, little basic knowledge of the reproductive biology of the species is available to inform genetic improvement and resource management programmes. Here we take an integrative approach, using both field and molecular data, to identify ecological factors important to mating patterns in native populations of CCV. Field observation of pollinator visitation and flowering phenology of 20 trees showed that foraging behaviour of pollinator guilds varies depending on flowering phenology and canopy structure. A positive effect of tree mean flowering effort was found on insect visitation, while bat visitation was predicted by tree height and by the number of trees simultaneously bearing flowers. Moreover, introduced honeybees were observed frequently, performing 73% of detected flower visits. Conversely, nectar-feeding birds and mammals were observed sporadically with lorikeets and honeyeaters each contributing to 11% of visits. Fruit bats, represented solely by the grey-headed flying fox, performed less than 2% of visits. Genotyping at six microsatellite markers in 301 seeds from 17 families sampled from four of Queensland's native forests showed that CCV displays a mixed-mating system that is mostly outcrossing (t(m) = 0.899 +/- 0.021). Preferential effective pollination from near-neighbours was detected by means of maximum-likelihood paternity analysis with up to 16% of reproduction events resulting from selfing. Forty to 48% of fertilising pollen was also carried from longer distance (>60 m). Marked differences in foraging behaviour and visitation frequency between observed pollinator guilds suggests that the observed dichotomy of effective pollen movement in spotted gums may be due to frequent visit from introduced honeybees favouring geitonogamy and sporadic visits from honeyeaters and fruit bats resulting in potential long-distance pollinations.",,,,"Bacles, Cecile/D-3093-2010; Lee, David J/D-1560-2010; Schenk, Peer/B-7879-2016; Kremer, Antoine/G-2272-2018","Bacles, Cecile/0000-0002-1061-1898; Lee, David J/0000-0002-5847-0836; Schenk, Peer/0000-0003-4878-3799; Kremer, Antoine/0000-0002-3372-3235; Lowe, Andrew/0000-0003-1139-2516",,,,,,,,,,,,2070-2620,,,,,JUN,2009,71,2,,,,,125,132,,10.2989/SF.2009.71.2.7.822,,,,,,,WOS:000267935600007,,,,,

The main cause of the decline is believed to be habitat destruction and fragmentation associated with urbanization and agricultural intensification. Urbanization is a process that involves dramatic and persistent changes of the landscape, increasing the amount of built-up areas while decreasing the amount of green areas. However, urban green areas can also provide suitable alternative habitats for wild bees. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied bumble bees in allotment gardens, i.e. intensively managed flower rich green areas, along a gradient of urbanization from the inner city of Stockholm towards more rural (periurban) areas. Keeping habitat quality similar along the urbanization gradient allowed us to separate the effect of landscape change (e.g. proportion impervious surface) from variation in habitat quality. Bumble bee diversity (after rarefaction to 25 individuals) decreased with increasing urbanization, from around eight species on sites in more rural areas to between five and six species in urban allotment gardens. Bumble bee abundance and species composition were most affected by qualities related to the management of the allotment areas, such as local flower abundance. The variability in bumble bee visits between allotment gardens was higher in an urban than in a periurban context, particularly among small and long-tongued bumble bee species. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that allotment gardens and other urban green areas can serve as important alternatives to natural habitats for many bumble bee species, but that the surrounding urban landscape influences how many species that will be present. The higher variability in abundance of certain species in the most urban areas may indicate a weaker reliability of the ecosystem service pollination in areas strongly influenced by human activity.",,,,,"Elmqvist, Thomas/0000-0002-4617-6197",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,May-15,2009,4,5,,,,,,,e5574,10.1371/journal.pone.0005574,,,,,,,WOS:000266107400016,19440367,,,,

Evidence so far is that greater susceptibility to land-use change is associated world-wide with small climatic ranges, range edges, and late-starting colony-development cycles. More evidence is needed on the roles of pollen specialization, nest sites, hibernation sites, and pesticides.

Such impacts are likely to vary according to the taxon of plant, the functional specificity of the native bees, and ecosystem context. Conversely, there have been more attempts to document impacts of invasive alien social bees on native bees. Most of these studies only indirectly evaluate competition for resources, have focused on a few native species and findings are sometimes contradictory. However, some studies showed strong negative impacts, suggesting that effects might be species-specific. Additionally, pathogen spillover and reproductive disruption due to interspecific mating has been demonstrated among some closely related taxa.

Bumblebees are a key component of farmland biodiversity as pollinators of both crops and wild flora. However, the factors determining their densities in such landscapes remain poorly understood. Using a combination of remote-sensed landscape data and molecular markers, we quantify the effects of land use (oilseed rape, field beans and non-cropped areas, all of which provide suitable bumblebee forage), at various spatial scales to find the best predictor of colony density for the bumblebee Bombus pascuorum Scopoli in an arable landscape. Estimated colony density was positively correlated with the area of all habitat categories within 1000 m of the sample site. No significant relationships were found for greater or lesser distances. This concurs with earlier estimates of the foraging range of this species. We found no evidence that nest sizes increased with forage availability, although our data do not allow us to categorically exclude this possibility. It has long been suspected that forage availability limits bee abundance in agricultural landscapes but there is little direct evidence for this. Here we report a direct relationship between floral abundance and bumblebee nest density within a notionally fixed area.

Thus, understanding the reproductive dynamics of scattered tree populations will be critical in determining how they can contribute to population restoration. The distance between conspecifics should be a key predictor of reproductive success, as more isolated trees are expected to receive fewer pollinator visits and experience increased transfer of self-pollen during longer pollinator foraging bouts. Further, isolation effects should be greater in species with less mobile pollinators. Here we contrast the effects of plant isolation on reproductive success of two species of eucalypt ""paddock trees"", Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus leucoxylon, with insect- and bird-pollination, respectively. Seed production was not affected by tree isolation in either the insect- or bird-pollinated species and once outliers were removed, neither was there an effect on germination rate. As somatic mutations may bias outcrossing rate estimates, we initially screened our microsatellite markers for mutations but found no variation in microsatellite profiles throughout the canopy of trees. individual outcrossing rates did not decline with increasing tree isolation in either the insect- or bird-pollinated species, though there was considerable variation in these rates at large distances, suggesting that pollination becomes unreliable with increasing tree isolation. We found that pollination distances have likely increased in tree species in agricultural landscapes, and that this may be facilitated by introduced honeybees in the case of E. camaldulensis. We therefore suggest that even isolated trees of these species produce seed of sufficient quantity and quality to contribute to population restoration. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Once it finds food, it can then follow a direct home vector to its nest. Furthermore, it remembers the coordinates of a food site, and uses these coordinates to return to the site. Previous studies suggest, however, that it does not associate any coordinates remembered from previous trips with familiar views such that it can produce a home vector when displaced to a familiar site. We ask here whether a desert ant uses any association between PI coordinates and familiar views to ensure consistent PI coordinates as it travels along a habitual route. We describe an experiment in which we manipulated the PI coordinates an ant has when reaching a distinctive point along a habitual route on the way to a feeder. The subsequent home vectors of the manipulated ants, when displaced from the food-site to a test ground, show that also when a route memory is evoked at a significant point on the way to a food site, C. fortis does not reset its PI coordinates to those it normally has at that point. We use this result to argue that local vector memories, which encode the metric properties of a segment of a habitual route, must be encoded in a route-based coordinate system that is separate from the nest-based global coordinates. We propose a model for PI-based guidance that can account for several puzzling observations, and that naturally produces the route-based coordinate system required for learning and following local vectors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,Apr-01,2009,212,7,,,,,901,905,,10.1242/jeb.024539,,,,,,,WOS:000264444100010,19282486,,,,

Yet, whether or not pollinators disperse from semi-natural habitat elements into the adjacent agricultural matrix may to a large extent depend on the quality of this matrix and the corresponding pollinator-specific life history traits. To investigate the effects of matrix quality on the distance decay of wild bees and hoverflies, six transects along vegetated field tracks originating at a large semi-natural main habitat and leading into the adjacent agricultural matrix were established in the Wetterau Region, central Hesse, Germany. Species richness of wild bees did not change with distance from the main habitat in landscapes with sufficient grassland cover in the surrounding landscape, but significantly declined when semi-natural grasslands where scarce and isolated in the adjacent agricultural matrix. Abundance of wild bees declined with distance regardless of matrix quality. Species richness of hoverflies did not decline with increasing distance in any landscape. Abundance even increased with distance to the main habitat independently of matrix quality. Thus, our data show that taxa of the pollinator guild may perceive landscapes quite differently. Because of their differing dispersal modes and resource requirements as compared to wild bees, hoverflies may play an important role in maintaining pollination services in agricultural landscapes unsuitable for bee species.

Individuals that performed other tasks did not maintain a predictable distance to the centre, and there was no evidence that spatial preferences changed over time.

Its ability to read and respond to several sets of extrinsic and intrinsic signals is fundamental for the modulation of individual activities and social systems. For instance, A. mellifera behavior changes upon the ontogenetic differentiation from nurse to forager worker subcastes. In this work, brain proteomes of nurses and foragers were compared by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis within pH range of 4-7 in order to find proteins related to such an ontogenetic and behavioral development. Twenty differentially expressed proteins were detected by gel image computational analysis, and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Nurse brain showed increased expression of major royal jelly proteins (MRJP1, MRJP2 and MRJP7), which are related to determination of castes during the honey bee larvae differentiation. Immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy showed that MRJP1 was localized in the cytoplasm of brain cells, seemingly along filaments of the cytoskeleton, in the antennal lobe, optical lobe and mushroom body. Also, MRJP1 was deposited on the rhabdom, a structure of the retinular cells, composed of numerous tubules. Such evidence suggests that MRJP1 could be associated to proteins of filamentous structures. MRJP1 was also found in intercellular spaces between cells in mushrooms bodies, indicating that it is a secreted protein. Other proteins implicated in protein synthesis and putative functions in the olfactory system were also up-regulated in the nurse brain. Experienced foragers overexpressed proteins possibly involved in energy production, iron binding, metabolic signaling and neurotransmitter metabolism. Such differential expression of proteins may be related to ontogenetic and behavior changes in A. mellifera.",,,,"Ricart, Carlos/A-7128-2013; Espindola, Foued Salmen/C-5324-2013; Garcia, Carlos Henrique Saraiva/Q-5336-2019; Fontes, Wagner/A-1771-2008; Bao, Sonia/V-1214-2019; de Sousa, Marcelo Valle/H-1838-2016","Espindola, Foued Salmen/0000-0002-6937-1411; Garcia, Carlos Henrique Saraiva/0000-0003-0224-9734; Fontes, Wagner/0000-0001-5140-8573; de Sousa, Marcelo Valle/0000-0002-2871-4430; Garcia Hernandez, Liudy/0000-0001-6260-7252; Bao, Sonia/0000-0002-9873-3098",,,,,,,,,,,,1535-3893,1535-3907,,,,MAR,2009,8,3,,,,,1464,1473,,10.1021/pr800823r,,,,,,,WOS:000264035000035,19203288,,,,

Reproductive tests were carried out to obtain fruit-flower relationship, counting of the number of seeds per fruit and number of trees in the transects sampled and estimate of the number of flowers per tree. S. leucanthum is self-incompatible and needs floral visitors to carry out pollination, since it only reproduces by crossbreeding. The fruit-flower relationship obtained was 0.0054, indicating a high energy cost attributed to the floral visitors' low efficiency in promoting pollination. The inter-plant distance was relatively shorter than the maximum distance traveled by the carpenter bees, while the trees produced few flowers per inflorescence and in moderate intensity, helping the pollination process by crossbreeding accomplished by the carpenter bees.

We combined gas chromatography and neural-ensemble recording in the moth's antennal lobe to examine population codes for the floral mixture and its fractionated components. Although the floral scent of D. wrightii comprises at least 60 compounds, only nine of those elicited robust neural responses. Behavioral experiments confirmed that these nine odorants mediate flower-foraging behaviors, but only as a mixture. Moreover, the mixture evoked equivalent foraging behaviors over a 1000-fold range in dilution, suggesting a singular percept across this concentration range. Furthermore, neural-ensemble recordings in the moth's antennal lobe revealed that reliable encoding of the floral mixture is organized through synchronized activity distributed across a population of glomerular coding units, and this timing mechanism may bind the features of a complex stimulus into a coherent odor percept.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-9822,1879-0445,,,,Feb-24,2009,19,4,,,,,335,340,,10.1016/j.cub.2009.01.041,,,,,,,WOS:000263779600027,19230669,,,,

Bumble bees occupy a wide range of habitats from the Nearctic to the Tropics in which they play an important role as pollinators. However, little is known about how a bumble bee colony regulates pollen collection. We manipulated protein quality and colony pollen stores in lab-reared colonies of the native North American bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. We debut evidence that bumble bee colony foraging levels and pollen storage behavior are tuned to the protein quality (range tested: 17-30% protein by dry mass) of pollen collected by foragers and to the amount of stored pollen inside the colony. Pollen foraging levels (number of bees exiting the nest) significantly increased by 55%, and the frequency with which foragers stored pollen in pots significantly increased by 233% for pollen with higher compared to lower protein quality. The number of foragers exiting the nest significantly decreased (by 28%) when we added one pollen load equivalent each 5 min to already high intranidal pollen stores. In addition, pollen odor pumped into the nest is sufficient to increase the number of exiting foragers by 27%. Foragers directly inspected pollen pots at a constant rate over 24 h, presumably to assess pollen levels. Thus, pollen stores can act as an information center regulating colony-level foraging according to pollen protein quality and colony need.",,,,"Nieh, James/H-8705-2014","Nieh, James/0000-0001-6237-0726",,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,,,,,FEB,2009,63,4,,,,,501,510,,10.1007/s00265-008-0684-3,,,,,,,WOS:000262669000003,,,,,

Among the sexually deceptive species, baiting for pollinators has shown that within populations orchid species are typically pollinated by a single species of thynnine wasp. However, some wasp species can be pollinators of more than one species of orchid usually when their ranges do not overlap. There is a trend for closely related orchids to exploit wasps from the same genus, with different lineages of orchids often pollinated by different genera. Very little is known about pollination of food-deceptive Caladenia species, although it is evident they attract a suite of generalist food-seeking insects. Food-deceptive species have a higher pollination rate than do sexually deceptive species. Studies of population genetics and pollen movements are few, although they suggest a pattern of fine-scale genetic structuring within populations, owing to predominantly restricted seed dispersal and low genetic differentiation among populations as a consequence of rare long-distance seed-dispersal events.

Fipronil, used at the dose of 0.1 ng/bee, induced mortality of all honeybees after one week of treatment. As a result of contact treatment at 0.01 ng/bee, honeybees spent significantly more time immobile in an open-field apparatus and ingested significantly more water. In the olfactory conditioning paradigm, fipronil-treated honeybees failed to discriminate between a known and an unknown odorant.

A Retreater-Releaser Concept,JOURNAL OF INSECT BEHAVIOR,,,,,,,,,,,,"Colony defence in Apis mellifera involves a variety of traits ranging from 'aggressive' (e.g. entrance guarding, recruitment of flying guards) to 'docile' (e.g. retreating into the nest) expression. We tested 11 colonies of three subspecies (capensis, scutellata, carnica) regarding their defensiveness. Each colony was selected as reportedly 'aggressive', 'intermediate' or 'docile' and consisted of about 10,000 bees. We applied three stimulation regimes (mechanical disturbance, exposure to alarm pheromones, and the combination of both) and measured their behaviours by tracking the rates of outflying bees at the entrance sites of the test hives. We provided evidence that for mechanical disturbances the test colonies resolved into two response types, if the 'immediate' defence response, assessed in the first minute of stimulation, was taken as a function of foraging: 'releaser' colonies allocated flying guards, 'retreater' colonies reduced the outside-hive activities. This division was observed irrespective of the subspecies membership and maintained in even roughly changing environmental conditions. However, if pheromone and mechanical stimulation were combined, the variety of colony defensiveness restricted to two further types irrespective of the subspecies membership: six of nine colonies degraded their rate of flying defenders with increasing foraging level, three of the colonies extended their 'aggressiveness' by increasing the defender rate with the foraging level. Such 'super-aggressive' colonies obviously are able to allocate two separate recruitment pools for foragers and flying defenders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0892-7553,1572-8889,,,,JAN,2009,22,1,,,,,65,85,,10.1007/s10905-008-9155-y,,,,,,,WOS:000261952700007,,,,,

A clonal woody species, Prunus ssiori, was partially self-incompatible according to a pollination experiment. Its main pollinators, bumble bees, were often observed to consecutively visit inflorescences within a tree. Clone identification revealed that its genets formed mutually exclusive patches. These features suggest frequent geitonogamous pollination. In a 6.24-ha plot, 212 trees belonged to 59 genets, and 42 genets consisted of a single tree, whereas the rest contained two or more clonal trees. The largest genet had 65 trees and occupied 0.4 of a hectare. Fruit set was measured in 127 inflorescences sampled from nine maternal trees at the center of the plot. Paternal genets of 107 of their 300 seeds were assigned in the plot using microsatellites. There were no selfed seeds. Male reproductive success (the probability that individual trees of each genet sired a seed) increased as tree size increased, as the distance between the trees and maternal trees decreased, when the genet did not contain the maternal trees, and when the genet consisted of a single tree. Female reproductive success (fruit set in individual inflorescences of each maternal tree) increased as the within-tree geitonogamy index, which reflected the frequency of pollination within the maternal tree, decreased. These results suggest that clonal growth reduces male reproductive success, at least, in P. ssiori, because of pollen discounting.",,,,"Kubo, Takuya/A-3414-2012; Nagamitsu, Teruyoshi/J-7710-2015","Kubo, Takuya/0000-0001-6202-9624; Nagamitsu, Teruyoshi/0000-0003-3366-7197",,,,,,,,,,,,1438-3896,1438-390X,,,,JAN,2009,51,1,,,,,175,186,,10.1007/s10144-008-0099-z,,,,,,,WOS:000261986700019,,,,,

The theridiid spider Anelosimus studiosus varies widely in its social structure at the northern edge of its range. Colony sizes range from the solitary/territorial female with her offspring to cooperative colonies of tens to hundreds of adult females. In previous work, we developed an assured fitness returns 'brood-fostering model' that predicts that in cooler environments mothers in multiple-female colonies will have a selective advantage over solitary female nests. According to the model, at cool sites the rate of juvenile maturation is slowed, increasing the probability that the mother will die before the brood reaches independence. In her absence, other females would foster her brood. We tested this hypothesis by manipulating colony size and by monitoring the reproductive success of naturally occurring solitary and multifemale colonies in cold and warm temperature environments. Our results indicate that while multiple-female colonies have higher fitness at cool sites, the solitary female nests achieve higher fitness at warmer sites. The higher reproductive success of multifemale colonies at cold sites further reflects the total failure of solitary female nests at these sites. Solitary female nests that survived generally had higher reproductive success than multifemale colonies at all temperatures. In natural colonies, fitness was highest for smaller multifemale colonies in the colder environments and decreased in the larger colonies. We use these data to re. ne the brood-fostering model and discuss the results with regard to the observed polymorphism in social structure. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Variation in flower colours within the hybrid zone was continuous; the most similar colours were predicted not to be discriminated from one another in natural foraging situations. However, when compared at a scale corresponding to bees' foraging range, some flower colours could be discriminated from all colours displayed by neighbouring plants. This could affect pollinator behaviour and explain lower visitation rates within the centre of the hybrid zone.

The inclination of the ground where plants grow, which has been little studied, could be one such factor. There may be differences in foraging performance when visiting flowers on horizontal planes compared with flowers on inclines planes. And if this is the case, pollinators may have a preference for horizontal or inclined planes. To test these possibilities, a series of laboratory experiments with bumble bees and arrays of artificial flowers were conducted. In the first experiment, bees were presented with a pair of floral arrays, one on a horizontal plane and one sloping. The bees preferred visiting flowers on the horizontal array. In the second experiment, bees were allowed to forage on a flower array tilted at various angles ranging from 0 degrees (horizontal) to 90 degrees (vertical). It was found that their foraging performance decreased with increasing angles, showing a 9.1% reduction from 0 degrees to 90 degrees arrays. This reduction was caused by an increased travel time between flowers, when moving upslope or downslope. These results suggest that plants growing on steep slopes may be less preferred by pollinators. Future studies are needed to clarify how slopes affect pollinator behaviour in field conditions and the ecological influences on plant reproduction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,,,,,DEC,2008,22,6,,,,,1027,1032,,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01473.x,,,,,,,WOS:000260670000011,,,,,

We conducted observations in eight reused nests (where a first generation of bees had been produced) kept in artificial boxes from the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Five nests were reused ( reactivated) by a single female (SFN), two nests reused by a mother and one daughter (MFN1) and one nest reused by the mother and two daughters (MFN2). No single nest was reactivated by unrelated females. The number of foraging trips, their duration and the duration of cell provisioning was not different between SFN and MFN. The overall production of cells per female was not different either between both types of nest. However, in MFN although all females did lay eggs, there was a reproductive skew in favor of the mother (95 and 45% of the brood produced in MFN1 and MFN2 respectively). She showed reproductive control of her daughters through oophagy and displaying threatening behavior when the daughters tried to open a cell where she had laid an egg. Brood losses to parasites (Anthrax sp. (Bombyliidae) and Hoplostelis bivittata (Megachilidae)) were only found in SFN which possibly reflects and advantage of MFN in this respect. Our results coupled with other studies in Euglossa, reveal that a wide range of social behaviors occur in this genus, from solitary and communal to primitive reproductive division of labor. Multiple factors involving different levels of pressure imposed by food availability and parasites may favor such a diverse range of nesting behaviors. Interestingly, female associations in E. viridissima seem a result of kin selection that is enforced by coercion from mother females on their daughters.

Intense nectar robbing by bumblebees significantly reduced the nectar available to legitimate pollinators in the studied population, and this reduction affected both male and female fitness. Significant differences were observed in fluorescent dye dispersion between robbed and non-robbed flowers within the population. Fluorescent dyes from non-robbed flowers were dispersed to larger distances and over a larger number of flowers when compared with robbed ones. Moreover, significant differences were observed in both fruit set and seed ovule ratios between the two groups, with non-robbed flowers presenting higher reproductive outcomes.

To explore the potential role that secondary metabolites play in pollination, we studied the pollination systems of five Diplomorpha species in Japan by investigating their floral morphology and flower-visiting insect fauna. We also analyzed the composition and temporal emission pattern of floral volatiles in one of the species to determine if there were any characteristics associated with the observed flower visitors. In Diplomorpha, anthesis began at dusk and various nocturnal moths were found visiting the flowers, often carrying numerous pollen grains on their proboscises. However, no hawkmoths were observed visiting Diplomorpha flowers. Diurnal insects visited the flowers less often, and most of them had short mouthparts and did not effectively contact the stigma. The floral scent of Diplomorpha sikokiana was released only at night when the moths were active and consisted mainly of monoterpenes and benzenoids, with a small amount of a sesquiterpene. The present study is the first to examine the pollination system of Diplomorpha and suggests that these plants exhibit a range of floral features associated with pollination by nocturnal moths. The single ovule in Diplomorpha flowers probably does not favor pollination by optimally foraging bees, which are more likely to cause intraplant pollen transfer, and might have facilitated adaptation to pollination by nocturnal moths, despite the lower number of pollen grains that are carried by these insects.",,,,"Okamoto, Tomoko/L-8550-2013","Okamoto, Tomoko/0000-0001-8135-481X",,,,,,,,,,,,0913-557X,,,,,DEC,2008,23,3,,,,,192,201,,10.1111/j.1442-1984.2008.00222.x,,,,,,,WOS:000260724200006,,,,,

Here, we seek factors that may simultaneously prevent subsocial Anelosimus species from colonizing the lowland rainforest while favouring species with large social groups in this habitat. To this end, we transplanted small groups of a subsocial species, which contain the offspring of a single female, from cloud forest habitat in the centre of its natural range to lower montane rainforest on the range margin and to lowland rainforest outside of the species range. Groups transplanted at the range margin and below their range limit were less likely to disperse and experienced increased mortality.

Generally, the predicted level of gene flow was found to depend on the visiting bee species and the spatial arrangement of the red clover fields. When the fields are close to each other, the gene flow depends mainly on the typical foraging distance of the visiting bee species, but when the fields are far apart, the gene flow between red clover fields is more sensitive to the distances between red clover fields than to the actual bumblebee species that pollinates the fields. Using the suggested methodology, the gene flow may be predicted in different agricultural scenarios. For example, if the gene flow between red clover fields is mediated by Bombus terrestris and the red clover fields that were assumed to be quadrates with sides of 100 m are separated by 200 m, then the median gene flow is predicted to be 0.17%.",,,,"Damgaard, Christian/G-2441-2010; Osborne, Juliet/I-6776-2012","Damgaard, Christian/0000-0003-3932-4312; ",,,,,,,,,,,,1420-2026,1573-2967,,,,NOV,2008,13,4,,,,,483,490,,10.1007/s10666-007-9112-8,,,,,,,WOS:000260263100003,,,,,

In this study we manipulate the amount of celestial compass information available to the bee during flight, and analyse the encoding of spatial information in the waggle dance as well as in the navigation of the foraging bee. We find that the waggle dance encodes information about the total distance flown to the food source, even when celestial compass cues are available only for a part of the journey. This stands in contrast to how a bee gauges distance flown when it navigates back to a food source that it already knows. When bees were trained to find a feeder placed at a fixed distance in a tunnel in which celestial cues were partially occluded and then tested in a tunnel that was fully open to the sky, they searched for the feeder at a distance that corresponds closely to the distance that was flown under the open sky during the training. Thus, when navigating back to a food source, information about distance travelled is disregarded when there is no concurrent input from the celestial compass. We suggest that bees may possess two different odometers - a 'community' odometer that is used to provide information to nestmates via the dance, and a 'personal' odometer that is used by an experienced individual to return to a previously visited source.",,,,"Srinivasan, Mandyam/G-5571-2010","Muthukumarasamy, Srinivasan/0000-0002-2948-6206",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,Oct-15,2008,211,20,,,,,3281,3286,,10.1242/jeb.021022,,,,,,,WOS:000259866400012,18840662,,,,

Coumaphos is used to control the mite Varroa destructor, an external parasite of the honeybee. The above areas are cultivated in large extent with citrus trees or cotton or sunflower crops, which are good forages for honeybees. The main pests of those crops are insects; hence, insecticides are used on a large scale for crop protection. The most contaminated samples originated from citrus groves; 16 out of 19 had pesticide residues: 4 samples had chlorfenvinphos (21.05%), 10 had chlorpyrifos (52.63%) and 2 had phorate (10.53%). Out of 17 samples from cotton fields, residues were found in 8, phorate in 6 (35.29%), chlorfenvinphos in 1 (5.88%), and chlorpyrifos in 1 (5.88%). Out of nine samples from fields of sunflower, four had phorate residues (44.44%). In brief, from the 50 analyzed samples, residues of chlorfenvinphos were detected in 5 samples (10%), residues of chlorpyrifos in 11 samples (22%), and residues of phorate in 12 samples (24%). Their levels ranged between 0.70 and 0.89 mu g/kg. Coumaphos residues ranged from 0.10 up to 4.80 mu g/kg and were derived exclusively from beehives treated with Perizin (the commercial formulation of coumaphos) for Varroa control. This study indicates that in agricultural areas with developed apiculture, useful information about the occurrence and the distribution of pesticide residues due to crop protection treatments can be derived from the analysis of randomly collected honey samples, used as bioindicators. It also shows that, very often, the chemicals used by apiculturists inside the hives in order to control disease are the main pollutants of the produced honey.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0090-4341,1432-0703,,,,OCT,2008,55,3,,,,,462,470,,10.1007/s00244-007-9126-x,,,,,,,WOS:000259191700012,18231699,,,,

Experimental support for Darwin's division-of-labour hypothesis,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Most animal-pollinated flowering plants offer nectar as a reward for their pollinators. Some 20 000 species, however, offer only pollen and rely on pollen-foraging bees for pollination. This creates a dilemma since pollen grains contain the male gametes and should be protected from becoming bee food. Darwin was the first to hypothesize that a 'division-of-labour' among stamens could solve this dilemma, with some stamens providing pollen as food, others providing pollen for fertilization. This hypothesis can only be tested if pollen grains from the two sets of stamens can be distinguished and their fates determined to the point of attachment on the stigma. 2. We tested Darwin's hypothesis in Melastoma malabathricum (Melastomataceae), a pollen-only flower with conspicuously differentiated stamens, an inner set that is short and yellow and an outer set that is much longer and purple with small yellow spurs. Pollen release is through terminal anther pores. Taking advantage of different exine patterns on the pollen produced by the two sets of stamens, we carried out a series of experimental manipulations to compare pollinator foraging behaviour and pollen pathways from anthers to stigmas. 3. The results demonstrate that in spite of all 10 stamens being buzzed simultaneously by the carpenter bees that pollinate M. malabathricum, pollen from the purple 'fertilization' stamens is dramatically more likely to land on stigmas than pollen from the yellow 'feeding' stamens. Removal experiments showed that the yellow 'feeding' stamens also attracted pollinators from a distance. Flowers that had their anther pores plugged received fewer buzzing bouts per visit, indicating that bees assessed the amount of pollen received per bout. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in pollen loads on stigmas of flowers that had their anthers plugged and stigmas of controls, demonstrating the efficiency of vector-assisted cross-pollination and the lack of vector-assisted self-pollination. 4. The unexpectedly precise placement of pollen grains even with buzz pollination, with a large proportion of the grains deposited out of the bees' grooming reach, helps explain the evolutionary persistence of pollen as a reward in spite of the bees' ability to assess the amount of pollen received during foraging bouts. Together, these results strongly support Darwin's division-of-labour hypothesis.",,,,,"Zhang, Dianxiang/0000-0001-6549-8872",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,,,,,OCT,2008,22,5,,,,,794,800,,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01444.x,,,,,,,WOS:000259343100005,,,,,

To resolve their generic and suprageneric relationships, we inferred a phylogeny based on three nuclear genes (Elongation factor 1-alpha, LW-rhodopsin and CAD) applying both parsimony and Bayesian methods. Our phylogeny, which includes 95 osmiine species representing 18 of the 19 currently recognized genera, is well resolved with high support for most basal nodes. The core osmiine genera were found to form a well-supported monophyletic group, but four small genera, Noteriades, Afroheriades, Pseudoheriades and possibly Ochreriades, formerly included in the Osmiini, do not appear to belong within this tribe. Our phylogeny results in the following taxonomic changes: Stenosmia and Hoplosmia are reduced to subgeneric rank in Hoplitis and Osmia, respectively, Micreriades is recognized as a subgenus in Hoplitis and the subgenus Nasutosmia is transferred from Hoplitis to Osmia. We inferred a biogeographic scenario for the Osmiini applying maximum likelihood inference and models of character evolution. We provide evidence that the Osmiini originated in the Palearctic, and that extensive exchanges occurred between the Palearctic and the Nearctic. The latter finding may relate to the fact that many osmiine species nest in wood or in stems, facilitating dispersal by overseas transport of the nests. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, long-distance pollen flow is difficuit to assess, especially when the plant also relies on self-pollination. Pollen movement can be estimated indirectly through population genetic data, but complementary data on pollinator flight distances is necessary to validate such estimates. By using radio-tracking of cowpea pollinator return flights, we found that carpenter bees visiting cowpea flowers can forage up to 6 km from their nest. Foraging distances were found to be shorter than the maximum flight range, especially under adverse weather conditions or poor reward levels. From complete flight records in which bees visited wild and domesticated populations, we conclude that bees can mediate gene flow and, in some instances, allow transgene (genetically engineered material) escape over several kilometers.

These experiments are the first to examine directly the impact of honey bee, Apis mellifera, nest invaders on plant pollination and fitness. A cost to pollination could occur under two scenarios: (1) at the colony level where nest invaders compromise the health of the foraging cohort and reduce their efficacy as pollinators or (2) at the community level where invaders simply kill bee colonies and reduce the local pollinator population. Honey bee colonies were manipulated to achieve different levels of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor or nest-invading beetle Aethina tumida and tented under one of two model plants: canola (Brassica napus) or rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei). On the basis of single-bee flower visits, fruit-set was reduced in blueberry with bees from varroa-parasitized colonies. However, on the basis of colonies, there were no differences in blueberry fruit-set, number of blueberry pollen tetrads deposited on the stigma, and pod-set in canola among colonies with different levels of nest invaders or no-invader controls. Thus, within the range of nest invader densities used in this study, individual inefficiencies were erased by compensatory multiple flower visits by this colonial pollinator. By failing to affirm the functionality of scenario (1) this study indirectly supports scenario (2): the major contribution of honey bee nest invaders toward a pollinator deficit is the simple eradication of colonies.

Maximising individual work effort is limited by the physical constraints on foraging outside the nest. Previous studies of factors influencing activity in social insects suggest that light intensity, ground and air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and/or rainfall may be important. This study aimed to determine which environmental factors influence foraging in an invasive social insect, Vespula germanica, which has been introduced to Australia, where it experiences a hotter and drier climate than in its native range. Activity was measured in terms of foraging traffic, with nests from a range of locations being monitored. Results indicate that the onset of rain reduces activity by approximately 30%, but foraging returns to previous levels immediately after rain stops. Foraging time is correlated with duration of daylight, with wasp daily activity being on average 22 min longer than the time between sunrise and sunset. Low light was found to restrict wasp activity, as were low and high temperatures. A linear mixed-effects model developed to explain the influence of these variables on numbers of foragers was highly significant. Under hot conditions, V. germanica individuals thermoregulate their body temperature by regurgitating water. They also use water in evaporative cooling to keep nests at optimum temperatures. Thus, in this species, hot temperatures increase the need for water, and so populations may be severely impacted in seasonally hot regions where water is limited.",,,,"Mackay, Duncan A/A-9966-2011; Reeson, Andrew/A-1207-2011","Reeson, Andrew/0000-0002-1603-2731; Mackay, Duncan/0000-0002-3326-7612",,,,,,,,,,,,0020-1812,,,,,SEP,2008,55,3,,,,,288,295,,10.1007/s00040-008-1004-7,,,,,,,WOS:000258959300012,,,,,

The specialized A. liliago pollinator Merodon rufus (Syrphidae) and high abundances of solitary bees could only be found in A. liliago populations with more than 10,000 individuals.

The visitation rates of these pollinators to eggplant flowers declined significantly with distance from the wild habitat. The importance of wild plants as alternative forage source for pollinators was assessed by a survey of the flowering plants in different habitats surrounding eggplant fields. While ruderal farm weeds provide much of these resources, the Acacia tortilis riverine forest experienced high visitation rates in one critical period of the dry season.

Following the principle of a case-by-case for transgenic crop safety assessment, we designed experiments to study pollen-mediated gene flow from herbicide-resistant transgenic oilseed rape to Chinese commercial varieties. The pollen dispersal was detected as the progeny of recipient plants that were identified as glufosinate resistant. The results indicated that pollen dispersal occurred up to 2000 m and its rate sharply decreased as the distance from the pollen source increased. However, the rate of long-distance pollen dispersal from 33 to 2000 m was less than 0.015% and did not present a gradual decrease, indicating the randomization of dispersal and pollination. Most pollen dispersed within a 4.5 m area around the transgenic pollen source plot, with a maximum of 1.19% at the sampling site of 1.4 m. Wind direction significantly affected the direction and the distance of pollen dispersal, resulting in the more and farther dispersal in southwest direction. However, the number of potentially pollinating bees was not correlated with direction and distance from the pollen source plot, suggesting that bee density and distribution would not contribute to the differences in pollen dispersal among different directions.

To obtain and serve biological information for sustainable forest management, we investigated reproductive biology and inbreeding depression in seeds of an important dipterocarp tree species, Shorea acuminata (Dipterocarpaceae), by both field and laboratory experiments. Results of parental analysis of immature and mature seeds showed that selfing rates varied greatly, from 7.6 to 88.4% among eight mother trees, and the mean overall selfing rate was 38.3%. Observed outcrossing events within a 40-ha study plot were predominantly (76.5%) short-distance events with a mating distance (md) : 100 m. Since the selfing rate sharply decreased with increase in the number of flowering conspecifics (i.e., individuals of the same species) within a 100-m radius from the mother trees, the local density of flowering conspecifics appears to be the key factor determining the outcrossing rate in S. acuminata. However, the extremely high selfing rate (88.4%) observed for one tree could not be simply explained by the low local density of flowering conspecifics. Instead, differences in its flowering phenology (its flowering peaked ca. a week earlier than most of the other examined individuals) may have severely limited its receipt of pollen from other conspecifics, and thus promoted selfing. Since there were no significant differences in the proportion of selfed progeny between immature and mature seed stages, there was no evidence of selective abortion of selfed seeds during seed development. However, the seed mass of outcrossed progeny was heavier than that of selfed progeny, and heavier seeds showed higher success rates at germination and seedling establishment. These results suggest that inbreeding depression resulted in reductions in seed mass and may reduce the fitness of selfed seeds in S. acuminata. In addition, the outcrossing rate of S. acuminata was more sensitive to low local conspecific flowering-tree densities than that of a sympatric bee-pollinated dipterocarp, species with greater pollination distances. These results suggest that the management of local adult-tree densities is important for avoiding selfing and inbreeding depression in future generations, especially in a species like S. acuminata with predominantly short-distance pollination.

We allowed bumble bee, Bombus impatiens, foragers from two colonies to collect pollen varying in quality ( 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% by mass mixed with indigestible alpha-cellulose). We used infrared thermography to measure surface T-th when a forager finished collecting feeder pollen and when she returned to the nest. Foragers significantly elevated their Tth over ambient air temperature while collecting pollen and maintained this elevated T-th upon returning to the nest.

We employ a transect setting, controlling for both forage and nest location, to assess the foraging distance of Bombus terrestris workers and the influence of environmental factors on foraging frequency over distance. The mean foraging distance of B. terrestris workers was 267.2 m +/- 180.3 m (max. 800 m). Nearly 40% of the workers foraged within 100 m around the nest.

Viewed multivariately, bees with low asymmetry and low loss of mean area, or with high asymmetry and high loss of mean area, differed from the other three treatment groups.

When species have become rare such studies are complicated because particular behavior or life history traits may be the cause but also the result of the decline of a species. We approached this problem by studying species' characteristics on specimens that were collected before the onset of their decline and preserved in natural history museums. In northwestern Europe, some bumble bee species declined dramatically during the 20th century whereas other, ecologically similar, species maintained stable populations. A long-standing debate focuses on whether this is caused by declining species having stricter host plant preferences. We compared the composition of pollen loads of five bumble bee species with stable populations and five with declining populations using museum specimens collected before 1950 in Belgium, England, and The Netherlands. Prior to 1950, the number of plant taxa in pollen loads of declining species was almost one-third lower than that in stable species even though individuals of stable and declining species generally originated from the same areas. There were no systematic differences in the composition of pollen loads between stable and declining species, but the plant taxa preferred by declining species before 1950 had experienced a stronger decline in the 20th century than those preferred by stable species. In 2004 and 2005, we surveyed the areas where bumble bees had been caught in the past and compared the composition of past and present pollen loads of the stable, but not of the by now locally extinct declining species. The number of collected pollen taxa was similar, but the composition differed significantly between the two periods. Differences in composition reflected the major changes in land use in northwestern Europe but also the spread of the invasive plant species Impatiens glandulifera. The main question now is why declining species apparently were not able to switch to less preferred food plants when stable species were.

For biologically relevant altitudes, wind speed increases exponentially with increased height above the ground. Thus, dispersal of most insects is influenced by atmospheric conditions. However, insects that fly close to the Earth's surface displace within the flight boundary layer where insect airspeeds are relatively high. Over the past 17 years, we have studied boundary-layer insects by following individuals as they migrate across the Caribbean Sea and the Panama Canal. Although most migrants evade either drought or cold, nymphalid and pierid butterflies migrate across Panama near the onset of the rainy season. Dragonflies of the genus Pantala migrate in October concurrently with frontal weather systems. Migrating the furthest and thereby being the most difficult to study, the diurnal moth Urania fulgens migrates between Central and South America. Migratory butterflies and dragonflies are capable of directed movement towards a preferred compass direction in variable winds, whereas the moths drift with winds over water. Butterflies orient using both global and local cues. Consistent with optimal migration theory, butterflies and dragonflies adjust their flight speeds in ways that maximize migratory distance traveled per unit fuel, whereas the moths do not. Moreover, only butterflies adjust their flight speed in relation to endogenous fat reserves. It is likely that these insects use optic flow to gauge their speed and drift, and thus must migrate where sufficient detail in the Earth's surface is visible to them. The abilities of butterflies and dragonflies to adjust their airspeed over water indicate sophisticated control and guidance systems pertaining to migration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1540-7063,,,,,JUL,2008,48,1,,,,,119,133,,10.1093/icb/icn011,,,,,,,WOS:000257577700011,21669778,,,,

Here we studied the effects of a displaced nest mark on the homing performances of Cataglyphis ants. Foragers were trained to shuttle between the nest, which was marked by a black cylinder ( the beacon), and an artificial feeder. Trained ants were captured at the feeder and transferred to a distant test field, where they experienced the nest mark at various positions relative to their home vector. When the beacon was positioned to one side of the point of release, the ants slightly drifted towards the beacon right at the start of their inbound run, but thereafter resumed their home-vector courses. When the nest mark appeared to one side further down the homing course, the ants set off in the home-vector direction, but then gradually drifted towards the beacon. The distance, at which this occurred, and the ants' drift from the home-vector course were very similar across test conditions. During the final search for the nest, landmark information dominated the ants' path integrator.

This navigational strategy requires an egocentric monitoring of the foraging path by incrementally integrating direction, distance, and inclination of the path. Monitoring the latter two parameters involves idiothetic cues and hence is tightly coupled to the ant's locomotor behavior. Results: In a kinematic study of desert ant locomotion performed on differently inclined surfaces we aimed at pinpointing the relevant mechanisms of estimating step length and inclination. In a behavioral experiment with ants foraging on slippery surfaces we broke the otherwise tightly coupled relationship between stepping frequency and step length and examined the animals' ability to monitor distances covered even under those adverse conditions. We show that the ants' locomotor system is not influenced by inclined paths. After removing the effect of speed, slope had only marginal influence on kinematic parameters. Conclusion: From the obtained data we infer that the previously proposed monitoring of angles of the thorax-coxa joint is not involved in inclinometry. Due to the tiny variations in cycle period, we also argue that an efference copy of the central pattern generator coding the step length in its output frequency will most likely not suffice for estimating step length and complementing the pedometer. Finally we propose that sensing forces acting on the ant's legs could provide the desired neuronal correlate employed in monitoring inclination and step length.",,,,,"Seidl, Tobias/0000-0002-0067-0739",,,,,,,,,,,,1742-9994,,,,,Jun-02,2008,5,,,,,,,,8,10.1186/1742-9994-5-8,,,,,,,WOS:000257561300001,18518946,,,,

Over the last decades, biodiversity in agricultural landscapes has declined drastically. Initiatives to enhance biodiversity, such as agri-environment schemes, often have little effect, especially in intensively farmed landscapes. The effectiveness of conservation management may be improved by scheme implementation near high-quality habitats that can act as a source of species. We evaluated up to what distance high-quality habitats (nature reserves and artificially created flower-rich patches) affect the diversity of forbs and pollinators in intensively farmed landscapes of the Netherlands. 2. We surveyed forbs, inflorescences, bees and hover flies and estimated pollination services in transects along ditch banks extending 300 m from four nature reserves forming small islands in landscapes dominated by agriculture. 3. In a separate experiment, we surveyed inflorescences, bees and hover flies in 1500 m long transects on farmland adjacent to five newly introduced flower-rich patches and in five control transects. 4. Species density of forbs declined over the first 75 m and species density and abundance of hover flies declined over the first 125 m beyond the nature reserves. Beyond these distances, no further declines were observed. The effects of flower-rich patches were spatially limited. The species density and abundance of bees and hover flies were significantly enhanced in the flower-rich patch, but only the abundance of hover flies was enhanced up to 50 m beyond the patch. 5. Synthesis and applications. In intensively farmed areas, remnant high-quality habitats sustain more abundant and diverse pollinator and forb communities than the surrounding countryside. They do enhance biodiversity on nearby farmland but increases are spatially restricted (< 150 m) and relatively small. These habitats may therefore function only as dispersal sources for ecological restoration sites or agricultural fields under extensification schemes that are located in close proximity. Habitat restoration in intensively used farmland should therefore be implemented preferentially in the immediate vicinity of high-quality habitats. In the short term, newly created flower-rich habitats are no alternative to pre-existing seminatural habitats for the promotion of pollinators on nearby farmland.",,,,,"Kleijn, David/0000-0003-2500-7164",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,,,,,JUN,2008,45,3,,,,,753,762,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01394.x,,,,,,,WOS:000255464600003,,,,,

Despite ongoing concerns and controversy over a putative 'global pollination crisis' there is little information on the response of bees, the most important group of pollinators, to land-use change. In particular, there are no published studies of the effects of tropical forest fragmentation on entire bee communities. 2. We examined bee community responses to forest fragment size, shape, isolation and landscape context (forest variables) by sampling foraging bees at ground level using aerial netting within, and in pastures adjacent to, 22 forest fragments ranging in area from c. 0.25 ha to 230 ha, in southern Costa Rica. We sampled each site 13 times in total, in both wet and dry seasons. 3. Although there were no effects of forest variables on bee diversity and abundance, we did find strong changes in bee community composition. In particular, tree-nesting meliponines (social stingless bees) were associated with larger fragments, smaller edge:area ratios and greater proportions of forest surrounding sample points, while introduced Apis showed opposite patterns. 4. Community composition was also strikingly different between forests and pastures, despite their spatial proximity. In forests, even in the smallest patches, meliponines comprised a much larger proportion of the apifauna, and orchid bees (euglossines) were common. In pastures, Apis was much more abundant and no euglossine bees were found. 5. These results agree broadly with other studies that have found contrasting responses to habitat fragmentation from different bee groups. Conserving meliponine bees, important for pollination of coffee and other crops, and euglossine bees, critical in long-distance pollen transport, will require forest. 6. Synthesis and applications. In the first study of the effects of tropical forest fragmentation on entire understorey bee assemblages, we found bee community resilience to land-use change, as deforested sites and small forest fragments can have a diverse component of bees. While bees as a whole show some degree of resilience to land-use change, there are taxon-specific responses and, in our study area, there is clear value to conserving native forest, particularly for the ecologically and economically important meliponine and euglossine bees.",,,,,"Brosi, Berry/0000-0002-9233-1151; Duran, Guillermo/0000-0002-1944-9524",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,JUN,2008,45,3,,,,,773,783,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01412.x,,,,,,,WOS:000255464600005,,,,,

Bumblebees provide an important pollination service to both crops and wild plants. Many species have declined in the UK, particularly in arable regions. While bumblebee forage requirements have been widely studied, there has been less consideration of whether availability of nesting sites is limiting. It is important to know which habitats contain the most bumblebee nests per unit area in order to guide conservation and management options; particularly in the light of current emphasis on environmental stewardship schemes for farmed landscapes. However, it is extremely difficult to map the distribution of bumblebee nests. 2. We describe the findings of the National Bumblebee Nest Survey, a structured survey carried out by 719 volunteers in the UK during early summer 2004. The surveyors used a defined protocol to record the presence or absence of bumblebee nests in prescribed areas of gardens, short grassland, long grassland and woodland, and along woodland edge, hedgerows and fence lines. The records allowed us to estimate the density of bumblebee nests in each of these habitats for the first time. 3. Nest densities were high in gardens (36 nests ha(-1)), and linear countryside habitats (fence lines, hedgerows, woodland edge: 20-37 nests ha(-1)), and lower in non-linear countryside habitats (woodland and grassland: 11-15 nests ha(-1)). 4. Findings on nest location characteristics corroborate those of an earlier survey carried out in the UK (Fussell & Corbet 1992). 5. Synthesis and applications. Gardens provide an important nesting habitat for bumblebees in the UK. In the countryside, the area occupied by linear features is small compared with that of non-linear features. However, as linear features contain high densities of nests, management options affecting such features may have a disproportionately large effect on bumblebee nesting opportunities. Current farm stewardship schemes in the UK are therefore likely to facilitate bumblebee nesting, because they provide clear guidance and support for 'sympathetic' hedgerow and field margin management.",,,,"Shortall, Chris/B-1191-2016; Goulson, David/A-2462-2010; Osborne, Juliet/I-6776-2012","Shortall, Chris/0000-0002-7175-5393; Goulson, David/0000-0003-4421-2876; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,JUN,2008,45,3,,,,,784,792,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01359.x,,,,,,,WOS:000255464600006,,,,,

It conveys to bees and human observers the position of a relatively small area at the endpoint of an average vector in a two-dimensional system of coordinates. This vector is often computed from a collection of waggle phases from the same or different dancers. The question remains, however, of how informative a small sample of waggle phases can be to the bees, and how the spatial information encoded in the dance is actually mapped to the followers' searches in the field. Certainly, it is the variability of a dancer's performance that initially defines the level of uncertainty that followers must cope with if they were to successfully decode information in the dance. Understanding how a dancer's behaviour is mapped to that of its followers initially relies on the analysis of both the accuracy and precision with which the dancer encodes spatial information in the dance. Here we describe within-individual variations in the encoding of the distance to and direction of a goal. We show that variations in the number of a dancer's wagging movements, a measure that correlates well with the distance to the goal, do not depend upon the dancer's travelled distance, meaning that there is a constant variance of wagging movements around the mean. We also show that the duration of the waggle phases and the angular dispersion and divergence of successive waggle phases co-vary with a dancer's orientation in space. Finally, using data from dances recorded through high-speed video techniques, we present the first analysis of the accuracy and precision with which an increasing number of waggle phases conveys spatial information to a human observer.",,,,,"De Marco, Rodrigo/0000-0002-2082-4264",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,May-15,2008,211,10,,,,,1635,1644,,10.1242/jeb.013425,,,,,,,WOS:000255504200018,18456891,,,,

Although sensorimotor learning has been described previously in bees and a few ant species, its potential importance for navigation has often been underestimated. Motor memories independent of landmark identification could nevertheless prove useful for ants such as the tropical species Gigantiops destructor that forages in visually complex environments. We tested the sensorimotor learning ability of these ants using unmarked Y-mazes of increasing difficulty: constant-turn mazes, simple and double alternation mazes and irregular mazes. In the absence of visual cues, the ants were able to learn not only motor displacement rules but also route-specific patterns of movement. The ants' preference for simple navigation strategies was also demonstrated by their tendency to use a simple repetitive motor rule different from the rule they were expected to learn. These findings suggest that relying on different sensorimotor memories eliminates the need to form, store and retrieve numerous landmark views along foraging routes, which are potentially cognitively demanding and time consuming in naturally cluttered environments.

From 1998 to 2003, we monitored local bee population size, rate of parasitism, and rate of larval and pupal mortality in reed trap nests as an accessible and standardized nesting resource. Experimentally enhanced nest site availability resulted in a steady increase of mean local population size from 80 to 2740 brood cells between 1998 and 2002. Population size and species richness of natural enemies increased with habitat area, whereas rate of parasitism and mortality only varied among years. Inverse density-dependent parasitism in three study years with highest population size suggests rather destabilizing instead of regulating effects of top-down forces. Accordingly, an analysis of independent time series showed on average a negative impact of population size on population growth rates but provides no support for top-down regulation by natural enemies.

An SLDS can describe complex temporal patterns more concisely and accurately than an HMM by using continuous hidden states. However, the use of SLDS models in practical applications is challenging for three reasons. First, exact inference in SLDS models is computationally intractable. Second, the geometric duration model induced in standard SLDSs limits their representational power. Third, standard SLDSs do not provide a principled way to interpret systematic variations governed by higher order parameters. The contributions in this paper address all of these three challenges. First, we present a data-driven MCMC (DD-MCMC) sampling method for approximate inference in SLDSs. We show DD-MCMC provides an efficient method for estimation and learning in SLDS models. Second, we present segmental SLDSs (S-SLDS), where the geometric distributions of the switching state durations are replaced with arbitrary duration models. Third, we extend the standard SLDS model with additional global parameters that can capture systematic temporal and spatial variations. The resulting parametric SLDS model (P-SLDS) uses EM to robustly interpret parametrized motions by incorporating additional global parameters that underly systematic variations of the overall motion.

The advantage of large inflorescences in terms of attractiveness was larger for racemes and umbels than for panicles, whereas the effect of inter-inflorescence distance on the number of successive probes was smaller for racemes than for panicles and umbels.

To reliably perform this task, bees combine both odometric and landmark cues, which potentially creates a dilemma since environments rich in odometric cues might be poor in salient landmark cues, and vice versa. In the present study, honeybees were provided with differential conditioning to images of complex natural scenes, in order to determine if they could reliably learn to discriminate between very similar scenes, and to recognise a learnt scene from a novel distractor scene. Choices made by individual bees were modelled with signal detection theory, and bees demonstrated an ability to discriminate between perceptually similar target and distractor views despite similar spatiotemporal content of the images. In a non-rewarded transfer test bees were also able to recognise target stimuli from novel distractors.

We trained bumble-bees (Bombus impatiens) to discriminate between artificial flowers that differed either in one modality, visual ( specifically, shape) or olfactory, or in two modalities, visual plus olfactory. Bees trained on multimodal flowers learned the rewarding flowers faster than those trained on flowers that differed only in the visual modality and, in extinction trials, visited the previously rewarded flowers at a higher rate than bees trained on unimodal flowers. Overall, bees showed a speed-accuracy trade-off; bees that made slower decisions achieved higher accuracy levels. Foraging on multimodal flowers did not affect the slope of the speed-accuracy relationship, but resulted in a higher intercept, indicating that multimodal signals were associated with consistently higher accuracy across range of decision speeds.

Bee communities in ruderal areas were significantly less diverse than those in native tallgrass prairie remnants, with about half as many species and approximately a third as many bees. Diversity, abundance, and richness of floral resources were also significantly less in ruderal grasslands than in native prairies, indicating that poor floral resource levels may substantially depauperate their bee communities. Common bees dominated the composition of the ruderal grasslands; only one rare species in this study was found at a ruderal site, indicating that high-quality prairie remnants are important reservoirs of bee diversity. Abundance of flowering ramets of a plant species was a significant predictor of the abundance of bees found on that plant. There was also a preference for human-yellow flowers after adjusting for ramet abundance and there were significantly more bees caught in yellow pan traps than blue or white ones. The abundance, but not the richness, of small bee species (length <= 7.5 mm) was less than expected at ruderal sites when compared to prairies, implying the presence of local nesting opportunities in ruderal grasslands for small bees but insufficient resources to support large populations.

Karl von Frisch described this communication system in terms of two distinct dances: ( 1) the round dance, which indicates the presence of a desirable food source close to the hive but does not provide information about its direction and ( 2) the waggle dance, which indicates the presence of a desirable food source more than 100 m from the hive and its provides information about both its distance and its direction. The view that honeybees have two discrete recruitment dances has been widely accepted since its inception in the 1920s. However, there are few detailed examinations of the behavioural parameters of dances over the range of food-source distances represented by round dances and waggle dances. Here, we show that both the round dance and the waggle dance convey information about distance and direction and that there is no clear switch between the two. We conclude that it is most meaningful to view the round and waggle dances as the ends of a continuum and that honeybees have just one adjustable recruitment signal: the waggle dance.

When foraging, all species face an identical problem: conveying information about profitable floral patches. However, profound differences in nesting biology (some nest in cavities while others nest in the open, often on a branch or a cliff face) may mean that species have different requirements when dancing to advertise new nest sites. In cavity nesting species, nest sites are a precise location in the landscape: usually a small opening leading to a cavity in a hollow tree. Dances for cavities therefore need to be as precise as possible. In contrast, when the potential nest site comprises a tree or perhaps seven a patch of trees, precision is less necessary. Similarly, when a food patch is advertised, dances need not be very precise, as floral patches are often large, unless they are so far away that recruits need more precise information to be able to locate them. In this paper, we study the dance precision of the open-nesting red dwarf bee Apis florea. By comparing the precision of dances for food sources and nest sites, we show that A. florea workers dance with the same imprecision irrespective of context. This is in sharp contrast with the cavity-nesting Apis mellifera that increases the precision of its dance when advertising a potential new home.

In T. recursa and T. spinipes, the first stingless bee trail pheromones were identified as hexyl decanoate and octyl decanoate, respectively. The attractant footprints left by foragers at the food source are secreted by glandular epithelia of the claw retractor tendon, not however by the tarsal gland. Regarding intranidal communication, the correlation between a forager's jostling rate and recruitment success stresses the importance of agitated running and jostling. There is no evidence for a ""dance"" indicating food source location, however, whereas the jostling rate depends on food quality. Thoracic vibrations, another intranidal signal well known in Melipona, were analyzed using modern technology and distinguishing substrate vibrations from airborne sound.

We investigated potential niche overlaps between introduced and native bumblebees in terms of morphological characteristics, seasonal flight activity, foraging and nesting habitat use, and plant species visited. There were considerable niche overlaps in flower resource use between B. terrestris and B. hypocrita sapporoensis/B. pseudobaicalensis. Bombus terrestris also potentially competes for nest sites with B. hypocrita sapporoensis. During 3-year monitoring, B. pseudobaicalensis showed no noticeable change, but B. hypocrita sapporoensis decreased while B. terrestris increased. Abundant flower resources provided by exotic plants may buffer native bumblebees from competition for food with introduced species. By contrast, the number of nest usurpers found in B. terrestris nests increased between 2003 and 2005, indicating that availability of nest sites was limiting and queens strongly competed for nest sites. Our findings suggest that competition for nest sites rather than flower resources is the major ecological mechanism for displacement of native bees. The large reduction of B. hypocrita sapporoensis queen indicates that B. terrestris may cause local extinction of native bumblebees.

This waggle dance is used by successful foragers to convey information about both the direction and distance to food sources. Nest mates can use this spatial information, increasing their chances of locating the food source. But how effective is the bees' dance communication? Previous work has shown that dancing does not benefit a honeybee colony under all foraging conditions and that the benefits of dancing are small. We used an individual-based simulation model to investigate under which foraging conditions it pays to dance. We compared the net nectar intake of 3 types of colonies: 1) colonies that use dance communication; 2) colonies that did dance but could not use the dance's spatial information; and 3) colonies that did not dance. Our results show that dancing is beneficial when the probability of independent discovery of food sources is low. Low independent discovery rates occur when patches are very small or very far away. Under these conditions, dancing is beneficial as only a single individual needs to find a patch for the whole colony to benefit. The main benefit of the honeybee's dance communication, however, seems to be that it enables the colony to forage at the most profitable patches only, ignoring forage patches that are of low quality. Thus, dancing allows the colony to rapidly exploit high-quality patches, thereby preventing both intra- and interspecific competitors from using that same patch.",,,,"Beekman, Madeleine/A-3983-2011; Beekman, Madeleine/AAF-8574-2019","Beekman, Madeleine/0000-0002-9040-3756; Beekman, Madeleine/0000-0002-9040-3756; Lew, Jie-Bin/0000-0003-2837-3565",,,,,,,,,,,,1045-2249,,,,,MAR-APR,2008,19,2,,,,,255,262,,10.1093/beheco/arm117,,,,,,,WOS:000254009800004,,,,,

We quantified the distribution of bumblebee Bombus terrestris L. foragers away from experimentally positioned colonies, in an agricultural landscape, using two methods. We mass-marked foragers as they left the colony, and analysed pollen from foragers returning to the colonies. The data were set within the context of the 'forage landscape': a map of the spatial distribution of forage as determined from remote-sensed data. To our knowledge, this is the first time that empirical data on foraging distances and forage availability, at this resolution and scale, have been collected and combined for bumblebees. 3. The bees foraged at least 1.5 km from their colonies, and the proportion of foragers flying to one field declined, approximately linearly, with radial distance.

The temporal pattern of these vibrations correlates with the sugar concentration of the collected food. One possible pathway for transfering such information to nestmates is through airborne sound. In the present study, we investigated the transformation of thoracic vibrations into air particle velocity, sound pressure, and jet airflows in the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris. Whereas particle velocity and sound pressure were found all around and above vibrating individuals, there was no evidence for a jet airflow as with honey bees. The largest particle velocities were measured 5 mm above the wings (16.0 +/- 4.8 mm s(-1)). Around a vibrating individual, we found maximum particle velocities of 8.6 +/- 3.0 mm s(-1) (horizontal particle velocity) in front of the bee's head and of 6.0 +/- 2.1 mm s(-1) (vertical particle velocity) behind its wings. Wing oscillations, which are mainly responsible for air particle movements in honey bees, significantly contributed to vertically oriented particle oscillations only close to the abdomen in M. scutellaris(distances <= 5 mm).

For nectar, which consists mainly of sugars, profitability is usually defined by its energetic value. Nectars, however, also contain a wide range of trace components, some of which affect their attractiveness. Honeybees produce honey from nectar. We compared the round dance and trophallaxis behaviours of bees foraging on avocado and citrus honey solutions, as a substitute for nectars. These sources differ in their trace-elements composition, with avocado nectar and honey containing higher concentrations of minerals than citrus nectar and honey. In a second experiment, we compared the behaviour of bees foraging on sucrose solution and sucrose solution enriched with four major mineral components of avocado nectar. Subjects foraging on avocado honey had a significantly lower probability of dancing than those foraging on citrus honey, a rate of direction reversals that was almost one half, a lower total number of reversals, shorter dance duration and longer trophallaxis time. When avocado honey was supplied to bees that previously fed on citrus honey, most of them avoided it, indicating a Strong context effect. When foraging on mineral-enriched sugar solution, dance variables tended to be lower compared with sucrose solution without minerals, but differences were smaller than the differences between the honey solutions. These results show that nectar trace components affect the estimation of nectar profitability by bees and consequently recruitment of new foragers to nectar sources.

To quantify the status of naturalization, it is necessary to establish a method for estimating the population size of the alien bees established in the field. Locating bumble bee colonies in the field is, however, very difficult because they usually nest underground. In this study, we estimated the number of colonies using genetic data from B. terrestris queens foraging near greenhouses in Biratori, Hokkaido, Japan, applying the Shared Loci Correspondence Analysis (SLCA). Sampled 39 queens were assigned to 30 different families, which indicates that most queens came from different colonies. Based on the findings, we discuss the importance of urgent measures to prohibit B: terrestris from escaping from greenhouses and becoming naturalized in Hokkaido.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-6862,,,,,FEB,2008,43,1,,,,,19,23,,10.1303/aez.2008.19,,,,,,,WOS:000254983800003,,,,,

To examine whether this is due to the landscape context farms are situated in and traits of the studied organisms, we surveyed bumble bees in cereal field borders and margins at 12 pairs of matched organic and conventional farms, with half the pairs located in heterogeneous farmland and the remaining in homogeneous plains. Species richness and abundance of bumble bees were significantly positively related to both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity. However, there was an interaction effect between farming practice and landscape context so that species richness and abundance were only significantly higher on organic farms in homogeneous landscapes. The higher abundance of bumble bees on organic farms was partly related to higher flower abundance on these sites. The effect of landscape context on bumble bee abundance was stronger for species with medium sized colonies than for those with smaller and larger colony sizes. These patterns may reflect that species with medium sized foraging ranges are most affected by fragmentation of foraging habitat, because colony size reflects the spatial scale at which bumble bees utilize resources. We conclude that both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity can be used to increase bumblebee species richness and abundance, but that organic farming has a larger effect in homogeneous landscapes and landscape heterogeneity a larger effect on conventional farms. The effects differed between species, suggesting that a single prescription to increase pollinator abundance may not be valid. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Outcrossing was variable, ranging from 52 to 89%, and long distance pollen dispersal was observed in all populations with up to 65% of pollen sourced from outside the populations over distances of at least 1 km. Modelling dispersal functions for pollination events within the two larger populations showed little difference between the four two-parameter models tested and indicated a fat-tailed dispersal curve.

Here, we investigate patterns of outcrossed mating through male function in Narcissus triandrus, a tristylous, bee-pollinated wild daffodil from the Iberian Peninsula, to test pollen transfer models which predict that floral morphology promotes asymmetrical mating and biased morph ratios. Unlike other tristylous species, N. triandrus has an incompatibility system that permits intra-morph mating and long-level rather than mid-level stamens in the L-morph. Incomplete sex-organ reciprocity should result in significant intra-morph mating in the L-morph. We measured mating patterns in two L-biased populations - dimorphic (two style morphs) and trimorphic (three style morphs) - using multilocus genotyping and maximum-likelihood-based paternity analysis. We also examined the spatial distribution of style morphs and neutral markers to investigate the potential consequence of spatially restricted mating on morph ratios. As predicted, we detected significant amounts of intra-morph mating in the L-morph in both populations. Pollen transfer coefficients generally supported predictions based on the Darwinian hypothesis that anthers and stigmas of equivalent level promote pollinator-mediated cross-pollination in heterostylous populations. There was evidence of significant spatial aggregation of both style morphs and neutral markers in populations of N. triandrus, probably as a result of restricted pollen and seed dispersal. Our results provide empirical support for theoretical models of pollen transfer, which indicate that the commonly observed L-blased morph ratios in Narcissus species result from significant intra-morph mating in the L-morph because of its atypical floral morphology.",,,,"Barrett, Spencer C.H./S-5782-2019; Barrett, Spencer CH/M-3751-2013","Barrett, Spencer C.H./0000-0002-7762-3455; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0016-6723,,,,,FEB,2008,90,1,,,,,3,15,,10.1017/S0016672307008956,,,,,,,WOS:000254308300003,18289396,,,,

We studied the foraging activity and fruit production of tomato using one colony of Nannotrigona perilampoides (NP) and one colony of Bombus impatiens (BI) in greenhouses with approximate to 1000 plants. Mechanical vibration (MV) was included as a test treatment. The foraging activity was measured as the number of flowers visited within 5 min, the time spent on a flower collecting pollen, the number of visits that a flower received and the duration of a foraging trip. BI collected pollen more rapidly, visited more flowers within 5 min and did more visits per flower when compared with NP that also lasted longer in their trips. Significant correlations were found between environmental variables and the number of bees entering the hive and the number of bees on the flowers. For NP, the highest correlation was found for light intensity whilst in BI a negative effect of environmental temperature was detected. Regarding the quantity of fruit, BI resulted in higher fruit set when compared with NP, but the latter performed similarly to MV. However, the weight of the fruit and seed number was significantly higher for BI when compared with NP, and this was higher than for MV. Our results demonstrate that at the densities of tomato plants tested, one colony of BI was more efficient pollinator when compared with NP. We suggest that pollination efficiency of NP could have been limited by a reduced number of foragers on the plants at a given time and their limited flight range when compared with BI. Therefore, it will be necessary to evaluate if increasing densities of colonies of NP could improve tomato yield in tropical greenhouses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0931-2048,1439-0418,,,,FEB,2008,132,1,,,,,79,85,,10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01246.x,,,,,,,WOS:000252322300010,,,,,

Post Pleistocene movements of most plants and animals into the region have generally followed East and North Greenland coastal routes, and the majority of the plants have North American affinities. Climatic change, bringing about reduction in the extent sea ice adjacent to the coast and changes in seasonality and associated precipitation and air movements, influences patterns of activity, growth, reproduction, and dispersal of all life forms present. Climate-associated changes in the biotic communities of the region are altering inter-species interactions, notably pollination, seed dispersal and plant-herbivore relations. Sexual reproduction and dispersal of propagules, primarily seeds, are essential processes underlying maintenance of genetic diversity in plant communities in Northeast Greenland. Wind and water transport of seeds are primary methods by which plants disperse and become established in the High Arctic, particularly at shorter distances. Birds and mammals are also involved and may be of particular significance to long-distance seed dispersal. In Northeast Greenland, dispersal of viable seeds may frequently occur by passage through the guts of geese and musk oxen. Research at Zackenberg on the role of insects in pollination of flowering plants has shown that Diptera species, primarily flies, dominate among the insect species visiting flowers each summer. Diptera, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Hymenoptera (bumble bees and small wasps), and one Hemiptera (true bugs) species have constituted the primary pollinators at Zackenberg. Arctic willow Salix arctica, white arctic bell heather Cassiope tetragona, and mountain avens Dryas octopetala are the primary species represented in the pollen present on pollinating insects at Zackenberg. The effects of climate warming that may enhance environmental conditions for plant growth in Northeast Greenland and accelerate invasion of new species will also be tied to the relationship of specific plant species to their insect pollinators. Those plants that are self-pollinated may have an initial advantage in an environment where insects and their plant relationships are being altered by the changing climate. An increase in growth and dispersal of shrubs in the Arctic is occurring as a consequence of climate warming. Increases in shrubs with more upright growth form, especially willows, will generate microhabitats not previously present in the High Arctic. The new habitats will make possible the invasion of new insect, mammal, and bird herbivores, as well as their parasites and predators.",,,,"Bruun, Hans Henrik/C-4476-2008","Bruun, Hans Henrik/0000-0003-0674-2577",,,,,,,,,,,,0065-2504,,978-0-12-373665-9,,,,2008,40,,,,,,81,100,,10.1016/S0065-2504(07)00004-9,,,,,,,WOS:000256528000004,,,,,

When visiting a familiar food source, the ants steer some distance downwind of the feeder, rather than attempting a direct approach that might miss small food sources, in particular. In the downwind area, the ants pick up the odor plume emanating from the food and follow it upwind to the prey. This strategy saves considerable walking distance and time. The additional path necessitated by the downwind strategy is only about 0.75 to 2 m, depending on nest-feeder distance, while missing the food on the upwind side results in much longer search trajectories. During the initial three to five visits to a feeding site, downwind distance and length of the approach path are shortened notably, and the approach trajectory is straightened. Desert ants further exhibit considerable short-term flexibility in their approach. Experienced individuals are evidently able to decide upon leaving the nest which direction to choose toward the feeder, depending on current wind direction (that fluctuates slightly during the day). Notable changes in wind direction occur primarily overnight. For larger nest-feeder distances, the animals adjust their approach en route to the altered wind direction during their first foraging trip in the morning.",,,,,"Wolf, Harald/0000-0003-2715-3376",,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,1432-0762,,,,JAN,2008,62,3,,,,,415,425,,10.1007/s00265-007-0469-0,,,,,,,WOS:000251729400012,,,,,

While the species is widespread in the young sandy landscapes of our main study area (Emsland, northwestern Germany), it occurs less frequently in the Lower Rhine valley. Our analyses of six polymorphic microsatellites show that the populations are only slightly differentiated, suggesting a relatively strong gene flow. No genetic structure corresponding to the geographic origin was found as the variability within populations accounted for the major proportion of variation. F-ST values were higher and allelic richness was lower in the Lower Rhine valley, supporting the hypothesis that habitat availability affects the degree of genetic exchange between populations.

We examined natural and introduced populations of C. torelliana for 4 years to determine the species of bees that disperse seeds, and the extent and distance of seed dispersal. The mechanism of seed dispersal by bees was also investigated, including fruit traits that promote dispersal, foraging behaviour of bees at fruits, and the fate of seeds. The fruit structure of C. torelliana, with seed presented in a resin reward, is a unique trait that promotes seed dispersal by bees and often results in long-distance dispersal. We discovered that a guild of four species of stingless bees, Trigona carbonaria, T. clypearis, T. sapiens, and T. hockingsi, dispersed seeds of C. torelliana in its natural range. More than half of the nests found within 250 m of fruiting trees had evidence of seed transport. Seeds were transported minimum distances of 20-220 m by bees. Approximately 88% of seeds were dispersed by gravity but almost all fruits retained one or two seeds embedded in resin for bee dispersal. Bee foraging for resin peaked immediately after fruit opening and corresponded to a peak of seed dispersal at the hive. There were strong correlations between numbers of seeds brought in and taken out of each hive by bees (r = 0.753-0.992, P < 0.05), and germination rates were 95 +/- 5%. These results showed that bee-transported seeds were effectively dispersed outside of the hive soon after release from fruits. Seed dispersal by bees is a non-standard dispersal mechanism for C. torelliana, as most seeds are dispersed by gravity before bees can enter fruits. However, many C. torelliana seeds are dispersed by bees, since seeds are retained in almost all fruits, and all of these are dispersed by bees.",,,,"Wallace, Helen/AAB-3162-2019; Lee, David J/D-1560-2010","Wallace, Helen/0000-0002-8801-4401; Lee, David J/0000-0002-5847-0836",,,,,,,,,,,,1366-9516,,,,,JAN,2008,14,1,,,,,87,94,,10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00427.x,,,,,,,WOS:000251584500010,,,,,

This tension zone is particularly interesting because A. m. capensis can be a lethal social parasite of A. m. scutellata. However, despite its parasitic potential, A. m. capensis appears to be unable to increase its natural range unassisted. We propose three interlinked mechanisms that could maintain the South African honeybee hybrid zone: (1) low fitness of intercrossed and genetically mixed colonies arising from inadequate regulation of worker reproduction; (2) higher reproductive success of A. m. scutellata via both high dispersal rates into the hybrid zone and increased competitiveness of males, countered by (3) the parasitic nature of A. m. capensis.",,,,"Beekman, Madeleine/AAF-8574-2019; Oldroyd, Benjamin/A-4800-2008; Beekman, Madeleine/A-3983-2011","Beekman, Madeleine/0000-0002-9040-3756; Oldroyd, Benjamin/0000-0001-6831-3677; Beekman, Madeleine/0000-0002-9040-3756; Wossler, Theresa/0000-0003-3725-6133",,,,,,,,,,,,0018-067X,,,,,JAN,2008,100,1,,,,,13,18,,10.1038/sj.hdy.6801058,,,,,,,WOS:000251727900005,17848972,,,,

In this study we examined this hypothesis, focusing on one of Israel's rarest butterflies, Tomares nesimachus (Rhopalocera; Lycaen-idae). The butterfly is affiliated with open grasslands in the north of Israel, where its sole host plant, Astragalus macrocarpus, occurs. In a two-year field study, we mapped the distribution of the butterfly in Israel and tried to evaluate the causes of its rarity and decline. We found that its abundance in habitat patches was correlated with several factors, including (a) fruit production of the host plants in each patch, (b) the number of other patches in the vicinity, (c) the characteristics of the ""matrix"" outside the patches within a distance of up to 2 km, (d) the richness of large bee species (the plant pollinators), and (e) the grazing management of the butterfly's habitat. The characteristics of the matrix further affected the richness of bees in the butterfly's habitat. Since butterfly abundance is correlated with species richness of pollinators, it can serve as an indicator of diverse, species-rich butterfly habitats (grasslands). We deduce that spccies that depend on fruit production and by themselves do not contribute to their host-plant pollination, may almost necessarily be affected by multiple ecological factors and therefore can indeed serve as good indicators. Our results further indicate that the butterfly's population dynamics are affected by large-scale processes, and hence its conservation requires the preservation of large open landscapes. Consequently, T nesimachus may also serve as an umbrella species.",,,,"Settele, Josef/A-6371-2009","Settele, Josef/0000-0002-8624-4983",,,,,,,,,,,,1565-9801,2224-4662,,,,,2008,54,1,,,,,111,136,,10.1560/IJEE.54.1.111,,,,,,,WOS:000257257300009,,,,,

These ecosystem services fall into two subcategories: those that arise via behavior (like consumption of agricultural pests) and those that arise via bird products (like nests and guano). Characteristics of most birds make them quite special from the perspective of ecosystem services. Because most birds fly, they can respond to irruptive or pulsed resources in ways generally not possible for other vertebrates. Migratory species link ecosystem processes and fluxes that are separated by great distances and times. Although the economic value to humans contributed by most, if not all, of the supporting services has yet to be quantified, we believe they are important to humans. Our goals for this review are 1) to lay the groundwork on these services to facilitate future efforts to estimate their economic value, 2) to highlight gaps in our knowledge, and 3) to point to future directions for additional research.",,,,"Whelan, Christopher J/H-4856-2019","Whelan, Christopher/0000-0001-7511-2603",,,,,,,,,,,,0077-8923,,978-1-57331-725-2,,,,2008,1134,,,,,,25,60,,10.1196/annals.1439.003,,,,,,,WOS:000257506400002,18566089,,,,

These declines may have severe ecological and commercial consequences since bumble-bees pollinate a range of wildflowers and crops. In England, attempts are being made to reintroduce forage resources through agri-environment schemes, yet there are few data on how the area of forage, or the landscape context in which it is provided, affects their success. We investigated the effects of sown forage patches on bumble-bees across sites varying in landscape characteristics. Bumble-bee densities were higher on sown patches compared with control habitats but did not vary with patch size, i.e. total forager numbers were proportional to patch area.

Features of model: Complementary analytical and simulation models determined the optimal proportion of nectarless flowers ('nectar phenotype') to maximize male reproductive success. Models considered a range of self-pollination costs and pollinator abundances. In the analytical model, equal numbers of each nectar phenotype were present. Pollinators used simple rules of behaviour, related to their current host plant's perceived nectar status, to decide whether to stay on that plant or to move to a new plant. In the simulation model, pollinators used more sophisticated departure rules, comparing the current host plant's perceived nectar status to the population mean. Plants with different proportions of nectarless flowers competed for successful pollination over multiple seasons. Ranges of key variables: Relative cost of self-pollination (0.5-1); number of pollinators acting on a plant population per season (1-101); and proportion of nectarless flowers per plant (0-1). Conclusions: Enhanced pollination success can drive the evolution of empty flowers in plants that are reliant on vector-mediated pollination. When the costs of selfing are low, an inflorescence with a low proportion of nectarless flowers is optimal, because pollination success is primarily determined by pollen removal. When the costs of selfing are high, an inflorescence with mostly nectarless flowers is optimal, because pollination success is primarily determined by outcrossing. Low pollinator abundances lead to a decreased optimal proportion of empty flowers to mitigate pollinator limitation.",,,,"Bailey, Susan F/X-7491-2019; Bailey, Susan F/B-4440-2013","Bailey, Susan F/0000-0002-2294-1229; Bailey, Susan F/0000-0002-2294-1229; Hargreaves, Anna/0000-0001-9680-9696; Teucher, Andy/0000-0002-7840-692X",,,,,,,,,,,,1522-0613,,,,,DEC,2007,9,8,,,,,1245,1262,,,,,,,,,WOS:000252652600002,,,,,

F.; Spaethe, J.",,,Bigger is better: implications of body size for flight ability under different light conditions and the evolution of alloethism in bumblebees,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. In social insects, reproductive success and survival of the colony critically depend on the colony's ability to efficiently allocate workers to the various tasks which need to be performed. In bumblebees, workers show a large variation of body size within a colony. Large workers tend to leave the nest and forage for nectar and pollen, whereas small workers stay inside the nest and fulfill nest duties. It was speculated that size-related differences of the sensory system might contribute to alloethism found in bumblebee colonies. 2. In the first part, we investigated how body size determines eye morphology. We measured several eye parameters of Bombus terrestris workers and drones. In both, workers and drones, larger individuals had larger eyes with larger facet diameters, more ommatidia and larger ocelli. At similar body size, drones exhibited larger eyes and ocelli compared to workers. Due to theoretical considerations, we predict that large individuals with large eyes should be better able to operate in illumination conditions of lower intensity than small individuals, since ommatidial sensitivity is proportional to the square of facet diameter. 3. In the second part, we tested this prediction. In a behavioural experiment, we first caught bumblebees of various sizes in the field and then determined the lowest light intensity level at which they are just able to fly under controlled laboratory conditions. We tested workers of B. terrestris and B. pascuorum, and workers and drones of B. lapidarius. Large bumblebees were able to fly under lower light levels compared to small bees, with light intensity thresholds ranging from 1.1 to 5.5 lux. 4. Our results indicate that the increased light sensitivity of the visual system of large bumblebees allows them to fly under poor light conditions, for example, very early in the morning or late at dusk. This is of potential benefit to the survival of a bumblebee colony since flowers that open early in the morning usually have accumulated a relatively high amount of nectar and pollen throughout the night, and large bumblebees can utilize these resources earlier than most other bees. Thus, our findings have important implications for the understanding of the functional significance and evolution of alloethism in bumblebee colonies.",,,,"Hernandez, Juan/AAC-6250-2020; Streinzer, Martin/AAE-2359-2019; Spaethe, Johannes/B-8826-2014","Streinzer, Martin/0000-0002-6656-7224; Spaethe, Johannes/0000-0002-0734-2869",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,,,,,DEC,2007,21,6,,,,,1130,1136,,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01329.x,,,,,,,WOS:000250985100015,,,,,

We trained foragers to a 2.5 M sucrose feeder in the center of an array of five identical feeders (20 cm between feeders) at different distances and directions from the nest and measured the distribution of recruit visitations. In the free-foraging phase foragers could odor mark a filter paper around the experimental feeder, and in the odor-removal phase we substituted it each five minutes by a clean one. Significantly more recruits in both species chose the experimental feeder over the controls in the distance and directional arrays (P <= 0.034) and odor removal significantly decreased precision of recruitment in both species (P <= 0.034).

The locomotor rhythm in foragers of the Japanese honeybee, Apis cerana japonica, was entrained to a skeleton temperature cycle. An initial warm temperature pulse was imposed at the beginning of subjective day and a second was applied at the end of the subjective day. A single warm pulse given every early subjective day in constant darkness (DD) entrained the locomotor rhythm without a second temperature pulse, but a single pulse given in late subjective day allowed a free-running rhythm. When honeybees were kept under a light-dark cycle, their body temperatures increased by 7-8 degrees C with locomotor activity. This temperature elevation remained during the photophase but followed the ambient environmental temperature at night. Body temperature oscillations continued to be circadian in DD, and temperature elevation occurred during the subjective day. In DD, the free-running period T of locomotor activity increased when the ambient temperature increased from 27 to 37 degrees C, although these changes were within the range of temperature compensation for many organisms. Under continuous light conditions (LL), tau remained constant with more strict temperature compensation. Patterns of brain period mRNA levels of forager bees maintained at different temperatures in LL revealed that the free-running period of per mRNA rhythm was temperature compensated. In addition, temperature strongly influenced the amplitude of the circadian transcriptional rhythms during the free-run period in LL, which may confer temperature compensation. We also discuss the possibility that daily changes in forager body temperatures may act as an internal Zeitgeber by fluctuating hive temperature. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Honey bees are imported for pollination, although the area in which the Park is embedded has over 700 species of native bees, many of which are potential orchard pollinators. We studied the visitation of native bees to apple, pear, apricot, and sweet cherry over 2 years. Thirty species of bees visited the flowers but, except for pear flowers, most were uncommon compared to honey bees. Evidence that honey bees prevented native bees from foraging on orchard crop flowers was equivocal: generally, honey bee and native bee visitation rates to the flowers were not negatively correlated, nor were native bee visitation rates positively correlated with distance of orchards from honey bee hives. Conversely, competition was tentatively suggested by much larger numbers of honey bees than natives on the flowers of apples, apricots and cherry; and by the large increase of native bees on pears, where honey bee numbers were low. At least one-third of the native bee species visiting the flowers are potential pollinators, including cavity-nesting species such as Osmia lignaria propinqua, currently managed for small orchard pollination in the US, plus several fossorial species, including one rosaceous flower specialist (Andrena milwaukiensis).

Although cross-pollination in commercial canola (Brassica napus) fields has been empirically measured, field trials are expensive and do not identify the causes of cross-pollination. Therefore, theoretical models can be valuable because they can provide estimates of cross-pollination at any given site and time. We present a general analytical model of field-to-field gene flow due to the following competing mechanisms: the wind, bees, and autonomous pollination. We parameterize the model for the particular case of field-to-field cross-pollination of genetically modified (GM) canola via the wind and via bumble bees (Bombus spp.) and honey bees (Apis mellifera). We make extensive use of the large data set of bee densities collected during the recent U.K. Farm Scale Evaluations. We predict that canola approaches almost full seed set without pollinators and that autonomous pollination is responsible for >= 25% of seed set, irrespective of pollinator abundance. We do not predict the relative contribution of bees vs. the wind in landscape-scale gene flow in canola. However, under model assumptions, we predict that the maximum field-to-field gene flow due to humble bees is 0.04% and 0.13% below the current EU limit for adventitious G M presence for winter and spring-sown canola, respectively. We predict that gene flow due to bees is similar to 3.1 times higher at 20% compared to 100% male-fertility, and due to the wind, 1.3 times higher at 20% compared to 100% male-fertility, for both winter- and spring-sown canola. Butuble bee-mediated gene flow is similar to 2.7 times higher and wind-mediated gene flow similar to 1.7 times lower in spring-sown than in winter-sown canola, regardless of the degree of male-sterility. The model of cross-pollination due to the wind most closely predicted three previously published observations: field-to-field gene flow is low; gene flow increases with the proportion of plants that are male-sterile; and gene flow is higher in winter- than in spring-sown canola. Our results therefore suggest that the wind, not bees, is the main vector of long-distance gene flow in canola.",,,,,"Hoyle, Martin/0000-0001-5593-9777",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,OCT,2007,17,7,,,,,2123,2135,,10.1890/06-1972.1,,,,,,,WOS:000250142500021,17974346,,,,

The foraging behaviour of these pollinators was observed in two environment types to determine their patch-leaving decisions. The rich environment was composed of male-fertile flowers, offering pollen and nectar, and the poor one of male-sterile flowers, offering little nectar and no pollen. The experimental design consisted of a patch system in which inflorescences were evenly arranged in two rows (1 m distance). Residence times of foragers inside inflorescences and rows were analysed by a Cox proportional hazards model, taking into account recent and past experience acquired during the foraging bout. Most of the results showed a decremental motivational mechanism, that is, a reduction in the residence time on the inflorescence or in the row related to exploitation of flowers within inflorescences and inflorescences within rows These results indicate that bumblebees tend to leave the patch using departure rules similar to those found in parasitoids. The results also provide information on the memory, learning and evaluating capabilities of bumblebees especially when rich and poor environments were compared.

In the second year, 2003, patch factors, plant species richness and current livestock grazing also influenced bumblebee species richness; plant species richness was positively correlated and current livestock grazing was negatively correlated with bumble bee species richness.

However, during the early years of breeding and seed increase, there was some uncertainty among regulators about containment measures needed to prevent the movement of regulated GM traits into adjacent fields of conventional cotton and possibly into the human or animal food chain. This was particularly relevant in the more tropical north of Australia that was being used as a winter nursery. Field experiments on GM cottons in eastern Australia were commonplace, but even there, regulators required confirmation that the containment practices already in place (buffer zones and isolation distances) were effective. A series of experiments in a range of environments, designed to monitor the movement of GM pollen into adjacent cotton buffers, adjacent fields, across bare ground and over long distances are reported here. Gene flow from GM plots into adjacent conventional cotton was found to be much higher in northern Australia than in eastern Australia, most likely due to higher honey bee (Apis mellifera) numbers, often deliberately enhanced to aid the surrounding horticultural industries. Movement of pollen over bare ground to nearby crops was observed at a number of locations indicating that small isolation zones should not be used for containment of regulated GM cotton. In general, buffers of 20 m of conventional cotton surrounding GM plots proved to be highly effective unless bee numbers were artificially high.

At any one time, a significant proportion of flowers often contain little or no reward. Hence, foraging profitably for floral rewards is problematic and any ability to discriminate between flowers and avoid those that are less rewarding will confer great advantages. In this study, we examine discrimination by foraging bees among flowers of nasturtium, Tropaeolum majus. Bee visitors included carpenter bees, Xylocopa violacea, which were primary nectar robbers; honeybees, Apis mellifera, which either acted as secondary nectar robbers or gathered pollen legitimately and bumblebees, Bombus hortorum, which were the only bees able to gather nectar legitimately. Many flowers were damaged by phytophagous insects. Nectar volume was markedly lower in flowers with damaged petals (which were also likely to be older) and in flowers that had nectar-robbing holes. We test whether bees exhibit selectivity with regards to the individual flowers, which they approach and enter, and whether this selectivity enhances foraging efficiency. The flowers approached (within 2 cm) by A. mellifera and B. hortorum were non-random when compared to the floral population; both species selectively approached un-blemished flowers. They both approached more yellow flowers than would be expected by chance, presumably a reflection of innate colour preferences, for nectar standing crop did not vary according to flower colour. Bees were also more likely to accept (land on) un-blemished flowers. A. mellifera gathering nectar exhibited selectivity with regards to the presence of robbing holes, being more likely to land on robbed flowers (they are not able to feed on un-robbed flowers). That they frequently approached un-robbed flowers suggests that they are not able to detect robbing holes at long-range, so that foraging efficiency may be limited by visual acuity. Nevertheless, by using a combination of long-range and short-range selectivity, nectar-gathering A. mellifera and B. hortorum greatly increased the average reward from the flowers on which they landed (by 68% and 48%, respectively) compared to the average standing crop in the flower population. Overall, our results demonstrate that bees use obvious floral cues (colour and petal blemishes) at long-range, but can switch to using more subtle cues (robbing holes) at close range. They also make many mistakes and some cues used do not correlate with floral rewards.",,,,"Goulson, David/A-2462-2010; Tinsley, Matthew/S-9707-2018","Goulson, David/0000-0003-4421-2876; Tinsley, Matthew/0000-0002-7715-1259; Park, Kirsty/0000-0001-6080-7197; Gilburn, Andre/0000-0002-3836-768X",,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,,,,,AUG,2007,61,10,,,,,1523,1529,,10.1007/s00265-007-0384-4,,,,,,,WOS:000247999100003,,,,,

In this study, we examine the possible factors affecting the learning and retention of nest-associated visual cues by the Australian desert ant Melophorus bagoti and the manner in which such cues are encoded by foraging ants. We placed four prominent cylindrical landmarks around a nest and trained foragers from that nest to a food source. Ants were tested with the landmark array in a distant testing field after (1) a known number of exposures to the landmarks (1, 3, 7 or 15 trials, spread over a period of 1 day, 2 days or >= 3 days) and (2) after a known period of delay (0, 24, 48, 96 or 192 h). The results show that a combination of an increase in training trials and an increase in number of training days affected the acquisition of landmark memory. Moreover, once the landmarks were learnt, they became a part of long-term memory and lasted throughout the ants' foraging lifetime. To examine visual cue encoding behaviour, ants trained under similar conditions for 4 days were tested with (1) an identical landmark array, (2) landmarks of the same size used in training, but placed at twice the distance from each other, and (3) landmarks whose dimensions were doubled and placed at twice the distance from each other. In conditions (1) and (3), the ants searched extensively at the centre of the four landmarks, suggesting that, similar to the Saharan ant (genus Cataglyphis) and the honeybee, M. bagoti too uses a snapshot to match the view of the landmarks around the nest. But contrary to the snapshot model, in condition (2), the ants did not search extensively at the centre of the landmarks, but searched primarily 0.5 m from the landmark, the distance from each landmark to the nest during training.

They have evolved several methods to do this, including compass-directed ""vector"" flights and the use of landmarks. If these hive-centered mechanisms are disrupted, bees revert to searching for the hive, but the nature and efficiency of their searching strategy have hitherto been unknown. We used harmonic radar to record the flight paths of honey bees that were searching for their hives. Our subsequent analysis of these paths revealed that they can be represented by a series of straight line segments that have a scale-free, Levy distribution with an inverse-square-law tail. We show that these results, combined with the ""no preferred direction"" characteristic of the segments, demonstrate that the bees were flying an optimal search pattern.

Their life- history is dominated by a period of within-nest activity followed by a phase of long-distance flights and foraging. General insights into insect metabolism imply that foraging onset is associated with fundamental metabolic changes, and theory on social evolution suggests metabolic adaptations that are advantageous for the colony as a whole. Results: Here we address the life- history characteristics of workers with LC- MS/ MS based relative quantification of major proteins. Our approach includes: i. Calculation of a false positive rate for the identifications, ii. Support of relative protein quantification results obtained from spectral count by non- parametric statistics, and iii. Correction for Type I error inflation using a bootstrap iteration analysis. Our data are consistent with the use of glucose as the main fuel for honey bee flight. Moreover, the data delivers information on the expression of ATPsynthases/ ATPases, and provide new insights into nurse- and forager- specific patterns of protection against oxidative stress.

Also, we estimated the locations of additional baboon groups relative to the study group. Routes were less linear, travel speed was higher, and inter-resource distances were larger when other groups were present within 500 m of the focal group; thus, the study group avoided others by taking detours. We predicted that evasive manoeuvres would be characteristic of different possible orientation mechanisms, and compared them with our observations. We analysed 34 evasive manoeuvres in detail. In an area that lacked prominent landmarks, detours were small; larger detours occurred when resources were directly visible, or in the vicinity of a hill offering conspicuous landmarks. In areas without prominent landmarks, detours were along familiar routes and waiting bouts of up to 60 min occurred; on one occasion the study group aborted their entire day's journey.

Studies with honeybees showed that recruitment precision is not a fixed feature, but it may be enhanced by factors like experience and distance. However, little is known regarding the recruitment precision of stingless bees. Hence, in this study, we examined the effects of experience and spatial distance on the precision of the food communication system of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona mexicana. We conducted the experiments by training bees to a three-dimensional artificial patch at several distances from the colony. We recorded the choices of individual recruited foragers, either being newcomers (foragers without experience with the advertised food source) or experienced (foragers that had previously visited the feeder). We found that the average precision of newcomers (95.6 +/- 2.61%) was significantly higher than that of experienced bees (80.2 +/- 1.12%). While this might seem counter-intuitive on first sight, this ""loss"" of precision can be explained by the tendency of experienced recruits to explore nearby areas to find new rewarding food sources after they had initially learned the exact location of the food source. Increasing the distance from the colony had no significant effect on the precision of the foraging bees. Thus, our data show that experience, but not the distance of the food source, affected the patch precision of S. mexicana foragers.",,,,"Sanchez, Daniel/Q-1872-2018; Kraus, Bernhard/B-8172-2011; Trejo, Yesenia YGTA/D-9257-2012","Sanchez, Daniel/0000-0003-1261-5320; Kraus, Bernhard/0000-0003-4354-9952; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0028-1042,1432-1904,,,,JUL,2007,94,7,,,,,567,573,,10.1007/s00114-007-0229-z,,,,,,,WOS:000247212000006,17333100,,,,

Here we show how the shape of difference functions depends on the depth structure and the contrast of natural scenes, by quantifying the depth- distribution of different outdoor scenes and by comparing it to the difference functions calculated with differently processed panoramic images, which were recorded at the same locations. We find (1) that IDFs and catchment areas become systematically wider as the average distance of objects increases, (2) that simple image processing operations-like subtracting the local mean, difference-of-Gaussian filtering and local contrast normalization-make difference functions robust against changes in illumination and the spurious effects of shadows, and (3) by comparing depth-dependent translational and depth-independent rotational difference functions, we show that IDFs of contrast-normalized snapshots are predominantly determined by the depth-structure and possibly also by occluding contours in a scene.

J,"Williams, NM; Kremen, C",,,,"Williams, Neal M.; Kremen, Claire",,,Resource distributions among habitats determine solitary bee offspring production in a mosaic landscape,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Within mosaic landscapes, many organisms depend on attributes of the environment that operate over scales ranging from a single habitat patch to the entire landscape. One such attribute is resource distribution. Organisms' reliance on resources from within a local patch vs. those found among habitats throughout the landscape will depend on local habitat quality, patch quality, and landscape composition. The ability of individuals to move among complementary habitat types to obtain various resources may be a critical mechanism underlying the dynamics of animal populations and ultimately the level of biodiversity at different spatial scales. We examined the effects that local habitat type and landscape composition had on offspring production and survival of the solitary bee Osmia lignaria in an agri-natural landscape in California (USA). Female bees were placed on farms that did not use pesticides (organic farms), on farms that did use pesticides (conventional farms), or in seminatural riparian habitats. We identified pollens collected by bees nesting in different habitat types and matched these to pollens of flowering plants from throughout the landscape. These data enabled us to determine the importance of different plant species and habitat types in providing food for offspring, and how this importance changed with landscape and local nesting-site characteristics. We found that increasing isolation from natural habitat significantly decreased offspring production and survival for bees nesting at conventional farms, had weaker effects on bees in patches of seminatural habitat, and had little impact on those at organic farm sites. Pollen sampled from nests showed that females nesting in both farm and seminatural habitats relied on pollen from principally native plant species growing in seminatural habitat. Thus connectivity among habitats was critical for offspring production. Females nesting on organic farms were buffered to isolation effects by switching to. oral resources growing at the farm site when seminatural areas were too distant. Overall local habitat conditions (farm management practices) can help bolster pollinators, but maintaining functional connectivity among habitats will likely be critical for persistence of pollinator populations as natural habitats are increasingly fragmented by human activities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,,,,,APR,2007,17,3,,,,,910,921,,10.1890/06-0269,,,,,,,WOS:000245744500023,17494406,,,,

Management of mobile organisms contributing to ecosystem services requires consideration not only of the local scale where services are delivered, but also the distribution of resources at the landscape scale, and the foraging ranges and dispersal movements of the mobile agents. We develop a conceptual model for exploring how one such mobile-agent-based ecosystem service (MABES), pollination, is affected by land-use change, and then generalize the model to other MABES. The model includes interactions and feedbacks among policies affecting land use, market forces and the biology of the organisms involved. Animal-mediated pollination contributes to the production of goods of value to humans such as crops; it also bolsters reproduction of wild plants on which other services or service-providing organisms depend. About one-third of crop production depends on animal pollinators, while 60-90% of plant species require an animal pollinator. The sensitivity of mobile organisms to ecological factors that operate across spatial scales makes the services provided by a given community of mobile agents highly contextual. Services vary, depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources surrounding the site, and on biotic interactions occurring locally, such as competition among pollinators for resources, and among plants for pollinators. The value of the resulting goods or services may feed back via market-based forces to influence land-use policies, which in turn influence land management practices that alter local habitat conditions and landscape structure.

The results obtained for symptomatic or dead bees support the correlation between high CBPV genomic load and pathology expression.

We review what is known about the genetics and physiology of two behavioral traits in honeybees, foraging specialization (pollen versus nectar), and defensive behavior, and present evidence that map-based cloning of genes is more feasible in the bee than in other metazoans. We also present bioinformatic analyses of candidate genes within,QTL confidence intervals (CIs). The high recombination rate of the bee made it possible to narrow the search to regions containing only 17-61 predicted peptides for each QTL, although CIs covered large genetic distances. Knowledge of correlated behavioral traits, comparative bioinformatics, and expression assays facilitated evaluation of candidate genes. An overrepresentation of genes involved in ovarian development and insulin-like signaling components within pollen foraging QTL regions suggests that an ancestral reproductive gene network was co-opted during the evolution of foraging specialization. The major QTL influencing defensive/aggressive behavior contains orthologs of genes involved in central nervous system activity and neurogenesis. Candidates at the other two defensive-behavior QTLs include modulators of sensory signaling (Am5HT(7) serotonin receptor, AmArr4 arrestin, and GABA-B-R1 receptor).

One group foraged in a stable array of six flowers for 40 foraging bouts, thereby enabling it to establish a long-term memory of the array, and adjust its spatial movements accordingly. The other group was faced with an array that changed between (but not within) foraging bouts, and thus had only access to a working memory of the flowers that had been visited. Bees in the stable array started out sampling a variety of routes, but their tendency to visit flowers in a repeatable, stable order (""traplining"") increased drastically with experience. These bees used shorter routes and converged on four popular paths. However, these routes were mainly formed through linking pairs of flowers by near-neighbour movements, rather than attempting to minimize overall travel distance. Individuals had variations to a primary sequence, where some bees used a major sequence most often, followed by a minor less used route, and others used two different routes with equal frequency. Even though bees foraging in the spatially randomized array had access to both spatial working memory and scent marks, this manipulation greatly disrupted foraging efficiency, mainly via an increase in revisitation to previously emptied flowers and substantially longer search times. Hence, a stable reference frame greatly improves foraging even for bees in relatively small arrays of flowers.",,,,"Chittka, Lars/C-3110-2012","Chittka, Lars/0000-0001-8153-1732",,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,APR,2007,151,4,,,,,719,730,,10.1007/s00442-006-0607-9,,,,,,,WOS:000246261800015,17136553,,,,

Over two years, we sampled bees and. oral resources in 21 pastures at three distance classes from a large (similar to 230- ha) forest patch and of three common types: open pasture; pasture with remnant trees; and pasture with live fences. We found no consistent differences in bee diversity or abundance with respect to pasture management or. oral resources. Bee community composition, however, was strikingly different at forest edges as compared to deforested countryside only a few hundred meters from forest. At forest edges, native social stingless bees ( Apidae: Meliponini) comprised similar to 50% of the individuals sampled, while the alien honeybee Apis mellifera made up only similar to 5%. Away from forests, meliponines dropped to similar to 20% of sampled bees, whereas Apis increased to similar to 45%. Meliponine bees were also more speciose at forest edge sites than at a distance from forest, their abundance decreased with continuous distance to the nearest forest patch, and their species richness was correlated with the proportion of forest cover surrounding sample sites at scales from 200 to 1200 m. Meliponines and Apis together comprise the eusocial bee fauna of the study area and are unique in quickly recruiting foragers to high- quality resources. The diverse assemblage of native meliponine bees covers a wide range of body sizes and. ower foraging behavior not found in Apis, and populations of many bee species ( including Apis), are known to. uctuate considerably from year to year.

In addition to foraging behavior, the nest location is an important factor for the success of the colony. The bumblebee's nest location would be affected by the spatial distribution of flowers and their food quality. In this study, we constructed a model to estimate bumblebee nest sites, using the net energy intake rate at available food sites for workers foraging from the nest site. We hypothesized that the probability of colony establishment at a site in coordinates (x, y) was high as the sum of the net energy intake rate I(x, y) increased. To obtain I(x, y), nectar standing crop, sugar concentration, and foraging time were measured for ten plant species in the study site covering 6.25 km(2). As available flowers changed seasonally, I(x, y) was calculated for three periods: the end of April, the beginning of May, and the middle of May. To verify our hypothesis, we compared the estimations in our model with the actual nest sites of Bombus ardens found in the beginning of May and June by means of tracking bumblebees.

Memorization of these cues facilitates the localization and recognition of food sources during foraging flights. Bees can also use information gained inside the hive during social interactions with successful foragers. An important information cue that can be learned during these interactions is food odor. However, little is known about how floral odors learned in the hive affect later decisions of foragers in the field. We studied the effect of food scent on foraging preferences when this learning is acquired directly inside the hive. By using in-hive feeders that were removed 24 h before the test, we showed that foragers use the odor information acquired during a 3-day stimulation period with a scented solution during a food-choice situation outside the nest. This bias in food preference is maintained even 24 h after the replacement of all the hive combs. Thus, without being previously collected outside by foragers, food odors learned within the hive can be used during short-range foraging flights.

The sound and air flows generated by dancer's wing and abdominal vibrations have been implicated as important cues, but the decoding mechanisms for these dance messages are poorly understood. To understand the neural mechanisms of honey bee dance communication, we analyzed the anatomy of antenna and Johnston's organ (JO) in the pedicel of the antenna, as well as the mechanical and neural response characteristics of antenna and JO to acoustic stimuli, respectively. The honey bee JO consists of about 300-320 scolopidia connected with about 48 cuticular ""knobs'' around the circumference of the pedicel. Each scolopidium contains bipolar sensory neurons with both type I and II cilia. The mechanical sensitivities of the antennal flagellum are specifically high in response to low but not high intensity stimuli of 265-350 Hz frequencies. The structural characteristics of antenna but not JO neurons seem to be responsible for the non-linear responses of the flagellum in contrast to mosquito and fruit fly. The honey bee flagellum is a sensitive movement detector responding to 20 nm tip displacement, which is comparable to female mosquito. Furthermore, the JO neurons have the ability to preserve both frequency and temporal information of acoustic stimuli including the ""waggle dance'' sound. Intriguingly, the response of JO neurons was found to be age-dependent, demonstrating that the dance communication is only possible between aged foragers. These results suggest that the matured honey bee antennae and JO neurons are best tuned to detect 250-300 Hz sound generated during ""waggle dance'' from the distance in a dark hive, and that sufficient responses of the JO neurons are obtained by reducing the mechanical sensitivity of the flagellum in a near-field of dancer.

In particular, SLCA does not require the estimation of allele frequency in a population.

Declines in abundance and diversity of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) in Europe have been linked to agricultural intensification and the resulting loss of suitable foraging and nesting habitats. Environmental Stewardship (ES) is a new scheme in England offering the opportunity to restore habitats of value for these important pollinators to agricultural land. Scientific evaluation of the options prescribed within the scheme is essential to ensure that their objectives are met and that the benefits can be realized by the full bumble bee species assemblage. 2. We compared the efficacy of different ES options for field margins on arable land in enhancing the abundance and diversity of flowering resources and foraging bumble bees. Our study was conducted over 3 years using a multisite experiment. 3. Overall, uncropped margins sown with mixtures containing nectar and pollen-producing plants were more effective in providing bumble bee forage than margins sown with a grass mix, allowed to regenerate naturally or managed as conservation headlands. 4. A mixture of agricultural legumes established quickly and attracted on average the highest total abundance and diversity of bumble bees, including the rare long-tongued species Bombus ruderatus and Bombus muscorum. However, marked differences were observed between species and sexes in their responses to field margin management over time. 5. A diverse mixture of native wildflowers attracted more of the shorter-tongued Bombus spp. and provided greater continuity of forage resources, especially early in the season. Allowing Cirsium spp. to flower on such margins also increased their attractiveness to male bumble bees. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the legume-based 'pollen and nectar flower mix', as prescribed under Entry Level Stewardship in England, can quickly provide a highly attractive forage resource for bumble bees, but that issues of seasonal flowering phenology and longevity of the mixture need to be addressed. Establishment of 'floristically enhanced margins' under Higher Level Stewardship will be important to provide diverse perennial communities of forage plants and to support a greater range of Bombus spp. and other pollinators.

In intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, many species are confined to very small uncultivated areas such as field margins. However, it has been suggested that these small habitat elements cannot support viable populations of all the species observed there. Instead, species richness and abundance in these small habitat fragments may, at least partly, be dependent on dispersal from larger semi-natural grassland fragments. 2. We tested this hypothesis for butterflies and bumble bees in 12 independent landscapes in a region of intense agriculture in southern Sweden. In each landscape we surveyed abundance and species richness in one semi-natural grassland, one linear habitat (uncultivated field margin) adjacent to this (called proximate) and one similar linear habitat (called distant) situated at least 1000 m from the semi-natural grassland patch. 3. Both species richness and density (individuals per unit area) of butterflies and bumble bees were significantly higher in proximate linear habitats than in distant ones. Moreover, butterfly species richness was higher for a given area in grasslands than in any of the linear habitat types. Butterfly density in grasslands did not differ from that in proximate linear habitats but was lower in distant linear habitats. The effect of isolation on density was stronger for less mobile butterfly species. For bumble bees there was no difference in species richness between grasslands and proximate linear habitats. 4. For at least some of the butterfly species even these relatively small fragments of semi-natural grasslands act as population sources from which individuals disperse to the surrounding habitats and thereby contribute to higher densities and species richness in adjacent areas. For bumble bees, it is more likely that the grasslands contain a higher density of nests than the surrounding intensively cultivated landscape, and that the density of foraging bumble bees decreases with increasing distance from the nest. 5. Synthesis and application. Habitat fragmentation and intensified agricultural practices are considered to be a threat against services provided by pollinators. In order to sustain the abundance and diversity of insect pollinators in intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, we suggest that preservation of the remaining semi-natural grasslands or re-creation of flower-rich grasslands is essential.",,,,"Ockinger, Erik/F-4154-2010","Ockinger, Erik/0000-0001-7517-4505",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,FEB,2007,44,1,,,,,50,59,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01250.x,,,,,,,WOS:000243023600007,,,,,

However, whereas extensive electrophysiological studies have been undertaken over the past ten years to characterize ionic currents underlying the physiological neuronal activity in honeybee, ionic currents underlying skeletal muscle fibre activity in this insect remain, so far, unexplored. Here, we show that, in contrast to many other insect species, action potentials in muscle fibres isolated from adult honeybee metathoracic tibia, are not graded but actual all-or-none responses. Action potentials are blocked by Cd2+ and La3+ but not by tetrodotoxin (TTX) in current-clamp mode of the patch-clamp technique, and as assessed under voltage-clamp, both Ca2+ and K+ currents are involved in shaping action potentials in single muscle fibres. The activation threshold potential for the voltage-dependent Ca2+ current is close to -40 mV, its mean maximal amplitude is -8.5 +/- 1.9 A/F and the mean apparent reversal potential is near +40 mV. In honeybees, GABA does not activate any ionic membrane currents in muscle fibres from the tibia, but L-glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular synapse induces fast activation of an inward current when the membrane potential is voltage clamped close to its resting value. Instead of undergoing desensitization as is the case in many other preparations, a component of this glutamate-activated current has a sustained component, the reversal potential of which is close to 0 mV, as demonstrated with voltage ramps. Future investigations will allow extensive pharmacological characterization of membrane ionic currents and excitation - contraction coupling in skeletal muscle from honeybee, a useful insect that became a model to study many physiological phenomena and which plays a major role in plant pollination and in stability of environmental vegetal biodiversity.",,,,", Belzunces/P-7061-2019",", Belzunces/0000-0003-1798-9962",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,Feb-01,2007,210,3,,,,,454,464,,10.1242/jeb.02667,,,,,,,WOS:000244083300018,17234615,,,,

Oral and topical octoparnine treatments modulated aspects of dances related to resource profitability in a dose-dependent manner. Dances for pollen and sucrose responded similarly to octoparnine treatment, and these effects were eliminated by treatment with the octoparnine antagonist mianserin. We propose that octoparnine modulates the representation of floral rewards in dances by changing the processing of reward in the honey bee brain.

Directional information is provided by a celestial compass, whereas distance measurement is accomplished by a stride integrator, or pedometer.

Ants with elongated legs ('stilts') or shortened legs ('stumps') take larger or shorter strides, respectively, and misgauge travel distance. Travel distance is overestimated by experimental animals walking on stilts, and underestimated by animals walking on stumps - strongly indicative of stride integrator function in distance measurement. High-speed video analysis was used to examine the actual changes in stride length, stride frequency and walking speed caused by the manipulations of leg length. Unexpectedly, quantitative characteristics of walking behaviour remained almost unaffected by imposed changes in leg length, demonstrating remarkable robustness of leg coordination and walking performance.

Because feeding time is a major determinant of visitation rate, I used a biomechanical model to examine how energy intake rate (E) varies with sucrose concentration, body mass (M), and proboscis length in orchid bees ( Apidae: Euglossini). Under geometric scaling, the optimal sugar concentration (S-max) should be largely independent of body size, and E proportional to M-1.0. In a comparative study of 30 orchid bee species ranging from 50 to 800 mg, S-max fell between 35% and 40% w/w, but E proportional to M-0.54, significantly less than model predictions. Proboscis length and radius scale geometrically with body mass, but proboscis length exhibits substantial size-independent variation, particularly in small bees. One cost of a long proboscis is a reduction in both E and S-max in accordance with the scaling model.

These include passerine birds and insects of four different orders, Hymenoptera (mainly Apidae), Diptera (mainly Nemestrinidae), Coleoptera (Scarabaeidae), and Lepidoptera (mainly Noctuidae). Apid pollination involves two discrete systems-passive pollination by anthophorines and native Apis mellifera foraging for nectar and active pollen gathering by A. mellifera and other Apoidea foraging for pollen. From what is known about relationships within Babiana and Crocoideae, it seems likely that passive pollination by anthophorines and honeybees, with nectar secreted in zygomorphic, bilabiate flowers as a reward, is the ancestral condition; it is also the most common, demonstrated for 18 and inferred for 35 more species from all three taxonomic sections of the genus. Active pollination by honeybees and female Apoidea foraging for pollen was demonstrated in one species and is inferred for four more, all of which have radially symmetric flowers and prominent anthers. Pollination by long-proboscid nemestrinids, mostly species of Prosoeca, is recorded for 13 species and inferred for live more, while moth pollination is recorded for one species and inferred for another two. Pollination exclusively by hopliine scarab beetles, known for six species, is associated with development of radial symmetry of the flower. Passerine bird pollination, associated with the classic syndrome of a wide floral tube, red floral pigmentation, and rigid, well-exserted stamens, occurs in two species, and is inferred for one more. Species with a bimodal system in which bees and beetles both visit and accomplish pollen transfer is known for three species. Comparing pollination systems with what is known about species relationships in Babiana, we infer that long-proboscid fly pollination evolved at least four times and moth pollination three times. Active pollination by pollen-collecting bees and hopliine beetle pollination also probably evolved three times each and bird pollination twice. Pollination systems are labile, and we postulate that there has been a minimum of 14 shifts in pollination system, approximately one shift for every six species. Lastly, Babiana species show the same correlation of morphology and floral presentation with particular sets of pollinators, described for several other genera of Iridaceae, e.g., Gladiolus L., Hesperantha Ker Gawl., and Lapeirousia Pourr., as well as Geraniaceae and Orchidaceae.

Optimization of route geometry in the absence of competition,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Foraging on resources that are fixed in space but that replenish over time, such as floral nectar and pollen, presents animals with the problem of selecting a foraging route. What can flower visitors such as bees do to optimize their foraging routes, that is, reduce return time or route distance? Some repeatedly visit a set of plants in a significantly predictable sequence (so-called ""trapline foraging""), which may also enhance their foraging efficiency. A moderate level of optimization and repetition of foraging routes can be reached by following simple movement rules for choosing the distances and turning angles of successive flights, without the use of spatial memory. If pollinators can learn the locations of patches and choose among possible foraging routes or paths, however, even better performance may be achieved. We tested whether and how bumble bees can optimize and repeat their foraging routes in laboratory experiments with artificial flowers that secreted nectar at a constant rate. With increasing experience, foraging routes of bees became more repeatable and efficient than expected from a combination of simple movement rules between successive flowers. We suggest that trapline foraging is a more sophisticated pattern of spatial use than searching and is based on memory. On the other hand, certain spatial configurations of flowers hampered optimization by the bees; bees preferred to choose short distances over straight moves and showed little plasticity in this regard. Developing an efficient trapline, therefore, may require prior selection of a set of plants with an appropriate spatial configuration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045-2249,,,,,JAN-FEB,2007,18,1,,,,,1,11,,10.1093/beheco/ar1053,,,,,,,WOS:000243060000001,,,,,

Five different sensory systems have been implicated in acquiring and communicating the information necessary for dance language communication. We present results from neuronal tracer studies identifying the central projections from four of the five. Sensory neurons of the dorsal rim area of the compound eyes, involved in acquiring sun-compass based information, project to the dorsal-most part of the medulla. Sensory neurons of the neck hair plates, required to transpose sun-compass based information to gravity-based information in the dark hive, project to the dorsal labial neuromere of the subesophageal ganglion. Sensory neurons from the antennal joint hair sensilla and the Johnston's organ, which perceive information on dance direction and distance from mechanostimuli generated by abdomen waggling and wing vibration, project to the deutocerebral dorsal lobe and the subesophageal ganglion, and the posterior protocerebrum, respectively. We found no `dance-specific' projections relative to those previously described for drone and queen honey bees and other insect species that do not exhibit dance communication. We suggest that the evolution of dance language communication was likely based on the modification of central neural pathways associated with path integration, the capability to calculate distance, and directional information during flight.

Naive bumblebees perform this innate antennal reaction either at the margin of flowers or at small coloured floral guides. LUNAU If 9921 hypothesised that the antennal reaction aims at the perception of substances on floral tissues through chemoreception. In order to test the effect of experience with distinct flower guides on the antennal reaction learning experiments were performed with worker bumblebees of the species Bombus terrestris. A choice of two types of artificial flowers was presented simultaneously: (1) Blue artificial flowers with a small central yellow colour mark, offering 7 mu l of 50% sucrose solution, and (2) blue artificial flowers with a small central brown colour mark, offering 7 mu l of 10% sucrose solution. The antennal reaction of individuals was monitored at two different phases in the experiment: (1) During the first 90 approaches, and (2) after 300 approaches to artificial flowers. Unexpectedly it was found that experienced bumblebees showed the antennal reaction significantly more often at the small central colour mark than less experienced ones. During flight, bumblebees retained the antennae in a position characterised by a distance between the antennal tips of more than 5 mm and by an angle between the antennal flagella of more than 90 degrees. Prior to antennal contact with the artificial flower experienced bumblebees reduced the distance between the antenna] tips to about 5 rum, which corresponds to the diameter of the central colour mark.

Darwin proposed memory limitations as a potential mechanistic explanation for this flower constancy behaviour. This reanalysis of a previously published dataset, relating a real-time sequential analysis of bumblebee flower choices to the distance distribution between flowers in a natural meadow, shows that Darwin was right in an unexpected way. Bees (Bombus spp) can learn how to extract rewards from several flower species, and switching between flower species does not compromise their handling efficiency (ie flower handling times do not increase following a species switch). However, bees do lose time flying between flowers. If a flower is encountered within a short time (0-2 sees) after the last flower visit, it is likely to be visited only if it is the same species. After longer intervals (3-6 sees), bees are more likely to switch to visiting different flower species. Thus, flower constancy is in part an effect based on comparing incoming stimuli (the flowers a bee detects in flight) with a transient form of short-term (working) memory, which holds the signal of the last visited flower. The relative weighting of working and reference memory changes as time passes following a flower visit. This results in a low probability of retrieving the memory for a different flower species (from that just visited) within a short time interval after the most recent flower visit (0-2 sees). This probability rises as the signal of the last visited flower fades from working memory (> 2 sees).",,,,"Chittka, Lars/C-3110-2012","Chittka, Lars/0000-0001-8153-1732",,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8177,,,,,,2007,29,2-Apr,,,,,179,199,,,,,,,,,WOS:000245912500008,,,,,

The reason for this imprecision has been the subject of recent debate. Some have suggested that imprecision within dances is non-adaptive, ie, that dancing bees arc limited in their ability to indicate more precise directional information; two hypotheses regarding possible limitations are examined. The 'brief--return-phase' hypothesis proposes that when signaling a nearby food source, the duration of the return phase (the time between successive waggle phases) is brief and a dancing bee does not have enough time or space to orient her waggle phases precisely. Similarly, the 'brief-waggle-phase' hypothesis proposes that a short waggle-phase duration prevents dancing bees from precisely orienting their waggle phases. Other investigators have suggested that the imprecision within dance,; is adaptive. The 'tuned-error' hypothesis proposes that the imprecision in dances serves to spread recruits over an optimal patch size tuned by natural selection. Here, these three hypotheses are investigated by analyzing 572 dances for food sources at 10 distances from the hive. It was found that the duration of the return phase does not differ in dances for near and far food sources, indicating that the imprecision is not caused by limitations imposed by brief return phases. It was also found that the scatter of waggle phase angles after left or right turns does not steadily increase as waggle phase duration decreases, indicating that the imprecision is not caused by limitations imposed by brief waggle phases. Finally, it was found that while patch size indicated within dances increases as distance to the food source increases, it does so at a rate significantly less than would be expected if bees were not adjusting their directional information in response to distance, thereby supporting the hypothesis of an adaptive value to the imprecision within dances for nearby food sources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8177,2363-7102,,,,,2007,29,2-Apr,,,,,285,298,,,,,,,,,WOS:000245912500015,,,,,

To examine how oligolecty persists in human modified habitats: (1) observations were made of plants it visited in both urban and rural habitats, (2) the type of pollen on its body was measured when foraging on either Vaccinium or Gelsernium, and (3) foraging behavior on Vaccinium, Gelsemium, and Azalea was studied across an rural/suburban/urban land use gradient in a foraging preference experiment. Male and female blueberry bees were recorded foraging on a wide range of plants in urban, suburban, and rural areas for both pollen and nectar. Female bees collected pollen from five genera in four families. Pollen on male and female bees collected on either Vaccinium or Gelsemium was predominantly from the species from which it was collected, but many specimens had both pollen types present. There were significant differences in foraging preferences among the three plant species and between gender. Overall, females preferred Gelsemium to Vaccinium, but males showed the opposite pattern. For both females and males, Azalea was the least preferred. Variation in the local abundance of flowers among the sites was not related to foraging preference. The foraging patterns of H. laboriosa in the landscape of human modified ecosystems suggests that H. laboriosa may be a mesolectic bee, using pollen from a few unrelated species, as opposed to a narrow oligolege (using pollen from only a few related species of Vaccinium). The preference for Gelsemium among female bees suggests that plantings of Gelsemium might be useful in enhancing populations of H. laboriosa in blueberry cultivation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8839,2078-6913,,,,,2007,46,1,,,,,19,27,,10.1080/00218839.2007.11101362,,,,,,,WOS:000245324100005,,,,,

To evaluate the risk of the returning flight of honeybee workers collecting water in comparison to nectar foraging bees three experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, workers drinking water from a watering trough and workers drinking sucrose solution from a feeder were caught and released a few hundred meters away. The proportion of water and nectar foragers returning to the nest was checked. In the second experiment only water-foraging workers displaced and released were tested. Some of them were allowed to drink water, and others were fed with sucrose solution immediately after reaching the watering trough. In both experiments the ratio of workers returning to the nests was significantly lower for those with water in their crops than for those with sucrose solution. The third experiment showed that experienced workers flying to the feeder with sucrose solution had less sugar in their crops (on average 0.1 mg) than did workers flying to the water source (on average 0.2 mg), although both ncctar and water foragers covered the same distance from the hive. These results consistently suggest that foragers with water in the crop have no reserve of metabolic fuel, so that they arc facing a higher risk of not returning to the nest than nectar foraging bees.

The stamens are exserted from the tube and have brown anthers prominently displayed on filaments +/- 4.5 mm long. The perianth tube contains 0.7-1.2 mu l of nectar in the lower half with a mean concentration of 23.5% sucrose equivalents. The flowers are visited systematically by an unnamed species of Prosoeca, a long-proboscid fly in the family Nemestrinidae, and occasionally by the butterfly Cynthia cardui (Nymphalidae) and the anthophorine bee Amegilla spilostoma (Apidae). The flies have a proboscis 10.5-11.5 mm long, which when inserted into the floral tube reaches the nectar held within the lower half of the tube. The frons and the proximal part of the head of the Prosoeca sp. contact the anthers during feeding, and the flies accumulate visible quantities of brown pollen during foraging bouts. Observations showed that these insects also contacted the stigmatic surfaces of style branches during this activity. Amegilla bees, which occasionally visit Romulea flowers, have a tongue 7 mm long and fail to reach the nectar when they insert their proboscis into the tube.

In a first step to understanding what this role might be, the morphology and physiological optics of ocelli were investigated in three tropical rainforest species - the nocturnal Sweat bee Megalopta genalis. the nocturnal paper wasp Apoica pallens and the diurnal paper wasp Polistes occidentalis - using hanging-drop techniques and standard histological methods. Ocellar image quality, in addition to lens focal length and back focal distance, was determined in all three species. During flight, the ocellar receptive fields of both nocturnal species are centred very dorsally, possibly in order to maximise sensitivity to the narrow dorsal field of light that enters through gaps in the rainforest canopy. Since all ocelli investigated had a slightly oval shape, images were found to be astigmatic: images formed by the major axis of the ocellus were located further froin the proxiinal surface of the lens than inia-es formed by file ninlor axis. Despite being astioniatic, iniages forined at either focal plane were reasonably sharp in all ocelli investigated. When compared to the position of the retina below the lens, measurement of back focal distance reveal that the ocelli of Megalopta are highly underfocused and unable to resolve spatial detail. This together with their very large and tightly packed rhabdoms suggests a role in making sensitive measurement of ambient light intensity. In contrast, the ocelli of the two wasps form images near the proximal boundary of the retina. Suggesting file potential for modest resolving power. In light of these results, possible roles for ocelli in nocturnal bees and wasps are discussed, including the hypothesis that they might be involved in nocturnal homing and navigation, using two main cues: the spatial pattern of bright patches of daylight visible through file rainforest canopy, and compass information obtained from polarised skylight (from the setting sun or the moon) that penetrates these patches.

Preference for pollen versus nectar may be an important trait mediating these ecological trade-offs, as preference for pollen enhances nutrient intake and brood production for the AHB in the tropics, while a relative preference for nectar enhances honey stores and winter survival for EHB. AHB exhibit morphological (higher thorax-to-body mass ratios) and physiological (higher thorax-specific metabolic rates) traits that may improve flight capacity, dispersal, mating success and foraging intake. Enhanced winter longevity, linked with higher hemolymph vitellogenin levels, may be a key factor improving winter survival of EHB. Data from South America and distributions of AHB in the southwestern United States suggest that AHB-EHB hybrids will extend 200 km north of regions with a January maximal temperatures of 15-16 degrees C. The formation of biotypic clines between AHB and EHB represents a unique opportunity to examine mechanisms responsible for the range limit of invaders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1540-7063,1557-7023,,,,DEC,2006,46,6,,,,,1110,1122,,10.1093/icb/icl046,,,,,,,WOS:000242442300038,21672812,,,,

It is important to understand the pollination processes that generate landscape-scale gene dispersal in plants, particularly in crop plants with genetically modified (GM) varieties. In one such crop, Brassica napus, the situation is complicated by uncertainty over the relative importance of two pollen vectors, wind and insects. 2. We investigated pollination in two fields of B. napus that bloomed at different times of year (April vs. July) and attracted different abundances of foraging social bees. Rates of pollen transfer were quantified by counting the pollen grains deposited on stigmas and remaining in the anthers at intervals after flower opening. 3. Flowers open in April were adequately pollinated only after 5 days and only 10% received even a single bee visit. Flowers open in July received three bee visits per hour and were fully pollinated within 3 h. 4. Based on published measurements of airborne pollen dispersal, we estimate that wind-pollination from a hypothetical field 1 km distant could have fertilized up to 0.3% of the field's seed when bees were scarce in April but only up to 0.007% when bees were abundant in July. 5. The efficiency of pollination (the proportion of pollen released from anthers that landed on receptive stigmas) was seven times greater in July (1.5%) than in April (0.2%). The relatively high efficiency of insect pollination may help to explain the evolutionary maintenance of entomophily. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results begin to resolve a long-standing inconsistency among previous studies by suggesting that the susceptibility of fields of B. napus to long-distance cross-pollination by wind depends on the level of bee activity. Models for predicting GM gene flow at the landscape-scale in this crop should take this into account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,DEC,2006,43,6,,,,,1196,1202,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01219.x,,,,,,,WOS:000241677100016,,,,,

Here, for the first time, we assess genetic diversity and population structuring of a threatened bumblebee species (Bombus sylvarum) which exists in highly fragmented habitat (rather than oceanic) islands. Effective population sizes, estimated from identified sisterhoods, were very low (range 21-72) suggesting that isolated populations will be vulnerable to loss of genetic variation through drift. Evidence of significant genetic structuring between populations (theta = 0.084) was found, but evidence of a bottleneck was detected in only one population. Comparison across highly fragmented UK populations and a continental population (where this species is more widespread) revealed significant differences in allelic richness attributable to a high degree of genetic diversity in the continental population. While not directly related to population size, this is perhaps explained by the high degree of isolation between UK populations relative to continental populations.

In honey bees and stingless bees, the thoracic temperature of feeding foragers is correlated with the caloric value of sucrose solution provided at feeders outside the nest. We provide the first detailed data showing that this phenomenon also occurs in the closely related bumble bee and thus may be homologous in all social bees of the Apidae. Using infrared thermography, we measured T-th for Bombus wilmattae foragers (mass 0.17 +/- 0.11 g, length 15.0 +/- 1.5mm) from six wild colonies, foraging on a range of sucrose concentrations (0.5-2.5 mol l(-1), 16-65% by mass) in foraging arenas. For all colonies, we measured significant increases in Delta T-th (P < 0.0001) with increasing sucrose concentration, with significant differences (P < 0.0001) between colonies due to different linear regression slopes (0.28-2.4) and y-intercepts (2.7-5.5).

The bees' task was to locate the reward in the arm of the Y-choice apparatus, where a black pattern on a white background was displayed in one arm versus a white target in the other arm, at a range of 27 cm. The alternative patterns for the training included previously identified cues. They were: an oblique bar, three parallel oblique bars, an oblique grating, a square cross, six spokes, a large or a small spot, a spotty modulation, or a ring. The trained bees were given a variety of interleaved tests to discover the labels they had used to identify the patterns. A label is defined as the coincidence of cues that contributed to the recognition of a single landmark. The bees learned, firstly, the black area at the expected place, secondly, modulation caused by edges at the expected place. These cues were quantified and always available. In addition, the orientation cue was learned from a grating that covered the target, but was ignored in a single bar. The bees learned the positions of the centres of black and of radial symmetry. In tests, they also recognized unfamiliar cues that were not displayed in the training. The cues and preferences were similar to those used to discriminate between two targets. The new experiments validate some old conclusions that have been controversial for 40 years. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the laboratory, individual workers were trained to visit an artificial feeder that provided a sucrose solution of 1%, 5%, 10%, 30% or 50% at controlled flows, in a similar span range to those observed in natural nectar sources. We measured foraging times, nectar loads collected, and CO2 production during actual feeding, as an indication of the energy expenditure for a single forager. Results show an increase in individual metabolic rates with increasing flow rate of sugar solution, but no dependence on sucrose concentration. This increase in metabolic expenditure does not depend on the crop load attained while feeding, as intuitively expected, and is therefore a result of an increased activity brought about by the food-source profitability experienced by the forager. The energy gained during collection of sugar solution is always higher than the energy spent by the ant. Even with a food source of lower quality than a natural source, the ants gain ca. tenfold of what they spend. Based on a simplified model, we calculated that foragers of C. rufipes could travel from 0.5 to 9 km with the energy gained in a single foraging trip only. These results suggest that decreasing foraging time is more important than increasing individual energetic efficiency when workers of the nectar-feeding ant C. rufipes decide to stop drinking and return to the nest with partial crop loads.",,,,,"Schilman, Pablo/0000-0003-1485-1650",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,Oct-15,2006,209,20,,,,,4091,4101,,10.1242/jeb.02478,,,,,,,WOS:000242132100019,17023603,,,,

Twentieth Century changes in range and frequency of these forage plants were assessed using data from the New Atlas of the British and Irish Flora (1930-1969 to 1987-1999) and the Countryside Surveys of Britain (1978-1998). Forage plants declined in both large-scale range and local-scale frequency between the two survey periods. These changes were of greater magnitude than changes in other native plant species, reflecting serious reductions in quality of foraging habitats for bees as well as a general decline in insect-pollinated plants. Seventy-six percent of forage plants declined in frequency within 1-km squares, including those (e.g. Trifolium pratense) of particular value for threatened bumblebee species.

Although invasive species are major topics of research, little consideration has been given to the implications of introducing non-native subspecies or beneficial organisms such as pollinators. However, the extensive trade in bumble bees as pollinators of glasshouse crops involves both. Within regions in Europe, the importation of non-native commercially reared subspecies of Bombus terrestris could endanger native bumble bees through competitive displacement and/or hybridization. 2. This study made a direct ecological comparison between commercially imported and native B. terrestris colonies growing in the wild in the UK. In particular, using a paired design, we compared the nectar-foraging performance and reproductive outputs of commercial and native colonies growing under identical field conditions. 3. Commercial colonies performed well in the field, with substantially higher nectar-foraging rates than native colonies in four out of five locations. Nectar-foraging performance was positively correlated with forager size, with commercial bees being consistently larger than native bees. 4. All seven commercial colonies studied produced gynes (new queens), with two colonies each producing in excess of 50. In contrast, only two out of seven native colonies produced gynes, and those only produced small numbers (five in total). Males were produced by all colonies but there were no significant differences in numbers between commercial and native subspecies. 5. Synthesis and applications. The high reproductive success of commercial colonies indicates that there is an appreciable risk that they will become established and spread within the UK. Furthermore, their superior foraging ability and large colony size could lead them to out-compete native bumble bees. Clearly the invasive potential of non-native subspecies and/or beneficial organisms should not be overlooked. With respect to the current importation of commercial bumble bees, we strongly recommend a precautionary approach: native species and subspecies should be locally reared and the use/disposal of bees should be strictly regulated.",,,,"Ings, Thomas C/J-3439-2012; Chittka, Lars/C-3110-2012","Ings, Thomas C/0000-0002-7496-1977; Chittka, Lars/0000-0001-8153-1732",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,OCT,2006,43,5,,,,,940,948,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01199.x,,,,,,,WOS:000239987700011,,,,,

Few studies, however, have so far examined their joint effects in natural populations. In this paper we evaluate the influence of flower damage and pollination by the hummingbird Oreotrochilus leucopleurus on the fecundity of the Andean monkey flower Mimulus luteus. We performed a 2x2 factorial experiment, with artificial clipping of lower petals and selective exclusion of the hummingbird as main factors. In spite of the relatively low proportion (27.5%) of the variance in seed production accounted for by the full factorial model, artificial damage and hummingbird exclusion, as well as their interaction, were highly significant, indicating nonadditive effects of factors on plant fecundity. In the presence of hummingbirds, undamaged flowers had a seed production that was 1.7-fold higher than for damaged flowers, suggesting that the effect of flower damage on female reproductive success occurs probably as a consequence of hummingbird discrimination against damaged corollas. This result indicates that the impact of flower herbivory on plant fecundity was contingent on the presence or absence of hummingbirds, suggesting that pollinators may indirectly select for undamaged and probably resistant flower phenotypes. A second interaction effect revealed that undamaged flowers produced 78.5% more seeds in the absence of rather than in the presence of O. leucopleurus, raising the question of the ecological mechanism involved. We suggest that the strong territorial behavior exhibited by the bee Centris nigerrima may confine the foraging activities of the remaining bee species to safe sites within exclosures. Overall, our results provide evidence that hummingbird pollination and flower herbivory have interdependent effects on M. luteus fecundity, which indicates that it will be difficult to predict their ecological and evolutionary consequences unless interactions are analyzed in an integrated form.",,,,,"Botto, Carezza/0000-0002-2726-2188; Medel, Rodrigo/0000-0001-9955-764X",,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,,,,OCT,2006,149,4,,,,,648,655,,10.1007/s00442-006-0479-z,,,,,,,WOS:000240799700009,16896778,,,,

Potential ecological consequences of invasion of non-native pollinators include increased pollination and seed set of invasive plants, with subsequent impacts on population growth rates and rates of spread. We outline a quantitative approach for evaluating the impact of a proposed introduction of an invasive pollinator on existing weed population dynamics and demonstrate the use of this approach on a relatively data-rich case study: the impacts on Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) from proposed introduction of Bombus terrestris. Three models have been used to assess population growth (matrix model), spread speed (integrodifference equation), and equilibrium occupancy (lattice model) for C. scoparius. We use available demographic data for an Australian population to parameterize two of these models. Increased seed set due to more efficient pollination resulted in a higher population growth rate in the density-independent matrix model, whereas simulations of enhanced pollination scenarios had a negligible effect on equilibrium weed occupancy in the lattice model. This is attributed to strong microsite limitation of recruitment in invasive C. scoparius populations observed in Australia and incorporated in the lattice model. A lack of information regarding secondary ant dispersal of C. scoparius prevents us from parameterizing the integrodifference equation model for Australia, but studies of invasive populations in California suggest that spread speed will also increase with higher seed set. For microsite-limited C. scoparius populations, increased seed set has minimal effects on equilibrium site occupancy. However, for density-independent rapidly invading populations, increased seed set is likely to lead to higher growth rates and spread speeds.

The compounds naringenin, isorhamnetin, and D-mannitol were isolated from yellow pollen loads, and beta-sitosterol, tricetin, selagin, and 8-methoxiherbacetin were found in brown pollen. Selagin is reported as a pollen constituent for the first time, and also D-mannitol, which was found in a substantial proportion (34.9%). The free radical-scavenging activities of different solvent extracts of pollen were determined using a 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazine (DPPH) assay. This activity decreases in the order: ethyl acetate > ethanol > hexane extract, which suggests that the ethyl acetate extract of the pollen, rich in flavonoids, is a good scavenger of active oxygen species.

J,"Thomson, DM",,,,"Thomson, Diane M.",,,Detecting the effects of introduced species: a case study of competition between Apis and Bombus,OIKOS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Developing tools for rapid assessment of introduced species impacts is one of the most important challenges in invasion ecology. Most assessments of impact rely on correlational data or other indirect measures. Yet few studies have evaluated invasion effects using multiple, simultaneously applied monitoring and experimental approaches, in order to compare easily obtained metrics with more difficult but direct measures of reproductive success or population dynamics. In this study, I use data from an experimental test of introduced honey bee (Apis mellifera) impacts on native bumble bees (Bombus spp.) to address two major questions: 1) how well did observational data on niche overlap and spatial correlations between Apis and Bombus predict the results of experimental tests of competitive effects? and 2) how well did effects of the experimental Apis manipulations on Bombus foragers, which are easy to observe, predict changes in reproductive success of colonies, which are difficult to measure? Niche overlap between Apis and Bombus varied substantially, but increased to levels as high as 80-90% during periods of resource scarcity. Correlations between numbers of Apis foragers and numbers of Bombus foragers were also highly variable, but I detected a significant negative relationship in only one of the seven months observed. In contrast, the experimental results showed that mean numbers of Bombus foragers observed on a given transect increased significantly with greater distance from introduced Apis colonies. Of these three measures (niche overlap, correlations in abundances, and effects of experimental introductions), only the experimental data on forager abundances accurately estimated competitive effects on colony reproductive success previously reported for the same experiment, and the correlational data in particular completely failed to predict the effects observed in the experimental study. This work suggests that great caution is warranted in making assessments of invasion impact on the basis of spatial or temporal correlations between invasive and native species. Thus, investing in even small and limited experimental studies may be more valuable than extensive observational work in quantifying invasion impacts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,,,,,SEP,2006,114,3,,,,,407,418,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14604.x,,,,,,,WOS:000239988300003,,,,,

Fieldwork was carried out in 1999 and 2000 on Mount Carmel, in northern Israel, a known hot-spot for bee diversity. Habitats with a range of post-burn ages and varying intensities of cattle grazing were surveyed by transect recording, grazing levels, and the diversity and abundance of both flowers and bees were measured. The species richness of both bees and flowers were highest at moderate to high grazing intensities, and path-analysis indicated that the effects of both grazing and fire on bee diversity were mediated mainly through changes in flower diversity, herb flowers being more important than shrubs. The abundance of bees increased with intensified grazing pressure even at the highest levels surveyed. Surprisingly though, changes in bee abundance at high grazing levels were not caused directly by changes in flower cover. The variation in bee abundance may have been due to higher numbers of solitary bees from the family Halictidae in grazed sites, where compacted ground (nesting resource) and composites (forage resource) were abundant. The effects of grazing on plants were clearest in the intermediate-aged sites, where cattle inhibited the growth of some of the dominant shrubs, creating or maintaining more open patches where light-demanding herbs could grow, thus allowing a diverse flora to develop. Overall, bee communities benefit from a relatively high level of grazing in phrygana. Although bee and flower diversity may decrease under very heavy grazing, the present levels of grazing on Mount Carmel appear to have only beneficial effects on the bee community.",,,,"Potts, Simon G/C-7250-2008","Potts, Simon G/0000-0002-2045-980X",,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,,,,,SEP,2006,114,3,,,,,529,543,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14004.x,,,,,,,WOS:000239988300014,,,,,

Females of Dawson's burrowing bees vary in body weight over a twofold range. Despite the potential for differences in body weight to affect several aspects of the competition among nesting females, no clear advantages were documented for larger females. 2. Nesting females were not consistently larger than emerging females, nor was there a consistent relationship between body size and the weight of pollen and nectar carried to the nest on provisioning trips. At one nesting location, larger females did not produce larger pre-pupal offspring nor did they produce offspring at a faster rate than their smaller nesting companions. 3. In addition, large body size was not associated with greater success in nest defence despite the fact that nesting females regularly encountered intruders in their burrows. Residency, not body size, determined the outcome of almost all contests for control of a nest burrow. The absence of a large body size effect here appears to stem from an intruder strategy designed to enable nest-searching females to acquire burrows that had been abandoned through death or dispersal of their original owners rather than securing existing nests through an aggressive takeover strategy. 4. Thus, although large body size conveys significant fitness advantages to males, this attribute does not promote female success in either provisioning or defending their nests.",,,,"Simmons, Leigh W/B-1815-2011","Simmons, Leigh W/0000-0003-0562-1474",,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,,,,,AUG,2006,31,4,,,,,352,357,,10.1111/j.1365-2311.2006.00791.x,,,,,,,WOS:000239120600010,,,,,

Six even-aged Bombus terrestris colonies were established in contrasting resource environments. Three colonies had access to abundant resources (Phacelia tanacetifolia fields with high flower densities), and three colonies were placed in an environment with sparse resources (scattered semi-natural habitats with food plants at lower densities). 3. A total of 870 foraging trips of 220 marked B. terrestris foragers were observed using automated camcorder recordings. 4. The duration of foraging trips was shorter in environments with abundant resources (66 +/- 4.6 min) than in environments with sparse resources (82 +/- 3.7 min). Within 34 days colonies that had access to abundant resources gained significantly more weight (129 +/- 40 g) than colonies foraging on sparse resources (19 +/- 7 g). 5.

The shapes of these curves determine what patterns of resource allocation can be evolutionarily stable. Although SA theory has stimulated creative thinking about plant sexual tactics, quantifying the shapes of male and female gain curves has proven so difficult that other approaches must be considered. I contrast sex allocation theory to a different, emerging viewpoint, pollen presentation theory (PPT), which attempts to address variation in reproductive success by measuring and modeling the quantitative fates of pollen grains. Models suggest that RS through male function depends heavily on the packaging and gradual dispensing of pollen to pollinators, even with the amount of investment held constant. Many plants do deploy pollen gradually, through morphological and ""behavioral"" mechanisms that range from obvious to subtle. They may thereby influence many aspects of the evolution of sexual modes in plants, including transitions between dioecy and cosexuality.

However, local resource partitioning does not fully explain the species diversity of bumblebee communities. Theoretical studies provide new evidence that partitioning of space can promote species coexistence, when species interact with their environment at different spatial scales. If bumblebee species possess specific foraging ranges, different spatial resource utilisation patterns might operate as an additional mechanism of coexistence in bumblebee communities. We investigated the effects of the landscape-wide availability of different resources (mass flowering crops and semi-natural habitats) on the local densities of four bumblebee species at 12 spatial scales (landscape sectors with 250-3,000 m radius) to indirectly identify the spatial scales at which the bumblebees perceive their environment. The densities of all bumblebee species were enhanced in landscapes with high proportions of mass flowering crops (mainly oilseed rape). We found the strongest effects for Bombus terrestris agg. and Bombus lapidarius at large spatial scales, implying foraging distances of 3,000 and 2,750 m, respectively. The densities of Bombus pascuorum were most strongly influenced at a medium spatial scale (1,000 m), and of Bombus pratorum (with marginal significance) at a small spatial scale (250 m). The estimated foraging ranges tended to be related to body and colony sizes, indicating that larger species travel over larger distances than smaller species, presumably enabling them to build up larger colonies through a better exploitation of food resources.

A survey was undertaken to understand clonal effects on fine-scale genetic structure (FSGS) in two populations (one from a disturbed and the other from an undisturbed locality) of Echinosophora koreensis, an endangered small shrub belonging to a monotypic genus in central Korea that reproduces both sexually and vegetatively via rhizomes. Methods Using inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) as genetic markers, the spatial distribution of individuals was evaluated using Ripley's L(d)-statistics and quantified the spatial scale of clonal spread and spatial distribution of ISSR genotypes using spatial autocorrelation analysis techniques (join-count statistics and kinship coefficient, F-ij) for total samples and samples excluding clones. Key Results A high degree of differentiation between populations was observed (Phi(ST(g)) = 0.184, P < 0.001). Ripley's L(d)-statistics revealed a near random distribution of individuals in a disturbed population, whereas significant aggregation of individuals was found in an undisturbed site. The join-count statistics revealed that most clones significantly aggregate at <= 6-m interplant distance. The Sp statistic reflecting patterns of correlograms revealed a strong pattern of FSGS for all four data sets (Sp = 0.072-0.154), but these patterns were not significantly different from each other. At small interplant distances (<= 2 m), however, jackknifed 95 % CIs revealed that the total samples exhibited significantly higher F-ij values than the same samples excluding clones. Conclusion The strong FSGS from genets is consistent with two biological and ecological traits of E. koreensis: bee-pollination and limited seed dispersal. Furthermore, potential clone mates over repeated generations would contribute to the observed high F-ij values among genets at short distance. To ensure long-term ex situ genetic variability of the endangered E. koreensis, individuals located at distances of 10-12 m should be collected across entire populations of E. koreensis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,1095-8290,,,,JUL,2006,98,1,,,,,165,173,,10.1093/aob/mcl083,,,,,,,WOS:000238759600015,16675603,,,,

The diminution of the Alpine Whinchat, once a widespread insectivorous passerine, has been ascribed to nest losses due to earlier and more frequent mowings. However, potential conjugated effects of deteriorated arthropod food availability had yet to be investigated. We compared food supply and nestling diet in intensively vs. traditionally managed grassland. Abundance and diversity of arthropods were much lower in intensive areas, where small-sized invertebrates, which do not enter nestling diet, were also predominant. Parents breeding in intensive habitats fed less biomass to nestlings than adults from traditional habitats. Nestling diet was less diverse and dominated by less profitable prey items in intensive than in traditional habitats. Feeding rate did not differ between the two habitats, but foraging distances from nest tended to be greater in intensive farmland. There were no significant differences in clutch sizes and hatching success with respect to management intensity, but fledging success was higher in traditional habitats. The recent intensification of farming practices has led to a decrease in the availability of grassland invertebrates, and of important Whinchat nestling food in particular, affecting parents' foraging efficiency and reproductive success. Conservation actions must not only reduce nest losses by postponing mowing, but should also promote grassland farming that is less detrimental to invertebrates. Dominant at the study site, organic grassland farming does seemingly not provide sufficient conditions for Alpine Whinchats. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A model was built using attractivity and productivity formulae based upon the flowering periods, the distances to the apiary, and the density and specific nectar productivity of the floral species surrounding the apiary. Honey harvests of 12 apiaries in Wallonie, Belgium ( Fig. 1), were recorded from 1998 to 2000. The plant species, location and absolute percentage of cover of nectar-producing (melliferous) plants within a radius of two km of each apiary were surveyed during the summer 2000. These data were encoded and geo-referenced with a Geographical Information System (GIS). This software used tables containing data from field survey and the theoretical melliferous potentials of encountered plants ( Tab. I). The model brought out the listing of foraged flowers and their potential honey productivity during flowering periods for each foraging area studied ( e. g. Fig. 3). The predictions of honey production (kg/hive/year) were compared to the actual production and the model explained 60% of the variance of the observations (F-1,F-10 = 37.76; P < 0.001; r(2) = 0.60; Fig. 2). Some tests of the sensitivity of the results to changing parameters showed the importance of a minimal 2-km radius to model the foraging range ( Tab. II).

Tropical and temperate trees grow on patches of high ground (tree islands) surrounded by lower elevation wetland communities (marl prairie). Tree islands of various sizes provide nesting substrate, larval host plants and floral resources for insect pollinators. Herbaceous plants in the open surrounding wetlands may also depend on these pollinators. We investigated pollinator diversity and abundances in both tree island and marl prairie habitats using transect sampling methods and estimated pollination success of the milkweed Asclepias lanceolata, an insect-pollinated marl prairie species, in relation to distance from and size of the closest tree island. On a total of 11 bayhead tree islands, we found that insect diversity and abundance were greater on the edge of larger tree islands (20-30 m(2)) than on smaller tree islands (5-10 m(2)). Pollinator diversity and abundance in the marl prairie decreased with increasing distance from tree islands. Pairs of potted A. lanceolata plants were placed in the marl prairie at distances up to 1000 m from small and large tree islands. Fruit and seed production were highest for plants placed less than 25 m from tree islands and decreased with increasing distance. Our results suggest that tree islands are an important source of pollinators for the plants in the tree island and surrounding wetland habitats. This landscape-based study illustrates how overall landscape structure affects important biotic interactions, particularly plant-pollinator relationships.

However, the time during which this navigational toolkit comes into play is extremely short, as the average lifetime of a Cataglyphis forager lasts for only about 6 days. Here we show, by using immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, and three-dimensional reconstruction software, that even during this short period of adult life, Cataglyphis exhibits a remarkable increase in the size of its mushroom bodies, especially of the visual input region, the collar, if compared to age-matched dark-reared animals. This task-related increase rides on a much smaller age-dependent increase of the size of the mushroom bodies. Due to the variation in body size exhibited by Cataglyphis workers we use allometric analyses throughout and show that small animals exhibit considerably larger task-related increases in the sizes of their mushroom bodies than larger animals do. It is as if there were an upper limit of mushroom body size required for accomplishing the ant's navigational tasks.

We compared herbivore colonisation rates and herbivory damage by ""Batrachedra' sp.

The number of eggs and larvae of colonising ""Batrachedra' sp., as well as average larval size and the proportion of S. ferrugineus stems damaged, all decreased logarithmically with increasing distance from the intact habitat, presumably due to dispersal limitation of the herbivore. Subsequently, to test whether the interaction can recover following habitat restoration, we surveyed herbivore colonisation rates and herbivory damage on naturally regenerated S. ferrugineus plants on experimentally restored 'islands' at increasing distances (up to 800 m) from an intact habitat. The rate of recovery of the interaction was surprisingly rapid (i.e. between 196 and 308 weeks). The degree of difference in the density of eggs and larvae, and in the proportion of stems damaged with increasing isolation from the intact wetland, gradually diminished over 196 weeks. After 308 weeks there was no significant difference in the insect-plant interaction between the intact wetland sites and any of the experimentally restored sites up to 800 m away.

Bees tested in the fresh tunnel exhibited a bias towards the shorter site, while bees tested in the training tunnel searched closer to the longer site. In additional experiments, we manipulated the position of scent cues, relative to the training location, in the testing tunnel. Bees generally searched at the site to which they were trained rather than at the position of the scent.

However, many of these studies were conducted in the laboratory or under artificial conditions. We investigated the role of the wax combs in nestmate recognition in the natural context of bees at colony entrances. Wax combs constructed by each experimental colony were swapped between hives and the acceptance of nestmate and non-nestmate forager workers was recorded before and after the swap, and in relation to a control hive not involved in the swap. We conducted the experiment twice, in consecutive years with three different colonies each time. Colonies that exchanged combs became more accepting of each other's workers than of workers from the third colony. The overall acceptance of comb swap non-nestmates increased significantly from 3% before the swap to 23% after the swap in the first year, and from 8 to 47% in the second year. This effect wore off within 3 weeks. Chemical analyses showed that the cuticular profile of non-nestmates involved in the experimental comb swap became more similar to each other after the swap, and that acceptance by guards of bees from different hives was negatively correlated with chemical distance between the hydrocarbon profiles of the workers from different hives.

Vellozia epidendroides is short, grows on pebbly or sandy soil, and is pollinated by bees. Vellozia leptopetala is arborescent, grows on rock outcrops, and is pollinated by bees and hummingbirds. Both are self-incompatible and have a short, massive flowering strategy. The study aimed to associate differences in their genetic diversity and structure with their microhabitat distribution and pollination ecology. center dot Methods Leaves from 106 and 139 plants of V. epidendroides and V. leptopetala, respectively, were collected from five patches of each species and prepared for electrophoretic analyses. center dot Key Results Five enzyme systems could be reliably scored for both species. Vellozia epidendroides showed 100 % of the loci polymorphic for almost all patches. The average number of alleles per locus ranged between 2.2 and 2.4 among patches. The Wright's fixation index (F) for this species was 0.226. A significant theta(p) value indicates that there is a reasonable genetic divergence among patches. Vellozia leptopetala presented 47.5 % of polymorphic loci. All levels of P, A, A(p) and of heterozygosities were lower than those of V. epidendroides. Vellozia leptopetala showed high inbreeding within patches. center dot Conclusions The relatively high values of genetic diversity indices found for V. epidendroides may be associated with its large and widespread populations. On the other hand, the low values of genetic diversity found for V. leptopetala may be related to physical isolation on outcrops and intensive foraging by territorial hummingbirds, which may hinder gene flow among patches, aggravated by the very restricted seed dispersal characteristic of the genus, that facilitates sibling mating. It is important to stress the need to preserve the specific habitats of these species of Vellozia, in particular those of V. leptopetala that has lower genetic diversity and is restricted to rock outcrop environments.",,,,"Jacobi, Claudia/B-7510-2013; Franceschinelli, Edivani/W-1035-2019; Franceschinelli, Edivani/G-6401-2012","Franceschinelli, Edivani/0000-0001-9050-8577; Franceschinelli, Edivani/0000-0001-9050-8577",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,1095-8290,,,,APR,2006,97,4,,,,,585,592,,10.1093/aob/mcl007,,,,,,,WOS:000236111700012,16446285,,,,

Recent UK agri-environmental policy aims to conserve and restore bumblebee populations by providing foraging habitats on arable field margins. We examined the effectiveness of strategies to achieve this, including sowing seed mixtures of (1) tussocky grass species, (2) wildflowers and (3) pollen- and nectar-rich plants. These were compared to conventionally managed cereal crops. Sampling was undertaken in 32 10 x 10 km squares throughout England, each containing a sample of the different field margin types. Bumblebee abundance in July and August was significantly higher on pollen and nectar margins (86 +/- 14 bees per 100 m) compared with wildflower margins (43 +/- 14), mature grass margins (6 +/- 14) and recently sown grass margins (8 +/- 4). Bees were virtually absent from the cereal crop (0.2 +/- 0.1). Bumblebee species richness was significantly higher on margins sown with either wildflowers or the pollen and nectar mix. There was evidence that richness of the bumblebee assemblage at the 10 x 10 km square scale was positively correlated with land use heterogeneity, the proportion of grassland, and the abundance and richness of dicotyledon flowers. The abundance of long-tongued bees per margin was explained by the number of pollen and nectar agreements per 10 x 10 km square, together with flower abundance. Future research is required to determine the quantity and location of foraging habitat required to sustain bumblebee populations at the landscape scale. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

These remnant patches and the surrounding desert are dominated by Larrea tridentata (creosote bush), a long-lived shrub whose flowers are visited by > 120 native bee species across its range. Twenty-one of these bee species restrict their pollen foraging to L. tridentata. To evaluate the response of this bee fauna to fragmentation, we compared species incidence and abundance patterns for the bee guild visiting L. tridentata at 59 habitat fragments of known size (0.002-5 ha) and age (up to 70 years), and in adjacent desert. The 62 bee species caught during this study responded to fragmentation heterogeneously and not in direct relation to their abundance or incidence in undisturbed desert. Few species found outside the city were entirely absent from urban fragments. Species of ground-nesting L. tridentata specialists were underrepresented in smaller fragments and less abundant in the smaller and older fragments. In contrast, cavity-nesting bees (including one L. tridentata specialist) were overrepresented in the habitat fragments., probably due to enhanced nesting opportunities available in the urban matrix. Small-bodied bee species were no more likely than larger bodied species to be absent from the smaller fragments. The introduced European honey bee, Apis mellifera, was a minor faunal element at > 90% of the fragments and exerted little if any influence on the response of native bee species to fragmentation. Overall, bee response to urban habitat fragmentation was best predicted by ecological traits associated with nesting and dietary breadth. Had species been treated as individual units in the analyses, or pooled together into one analysis, these response patterns may not have been apparent.

Clarendon, Oxford, 1930) can be altered by a number of factors. For example, the sex ratio theory predicts variation in equal investment in each sex when the maternal fitness gains from increased investment differ between sexes. Changing sex allocation because of changing payoffs may result from different ecological situations, such as foraging conditions. We investigated the impact of foraging travel cost on relative investment in sons vs daughters.

There were differences between the two habitats in numbers of pollen grains deposited on the stigma by these pollinators and in the pollinators foraging movements. The mean numbers of pollen grains observed on the stigma in the W was lower than in the CSO. Pollinators in the CSO moved longer distances, flying among inflorescences rather than staying within the same inflorescence. However, there were no differences in the number of flowers visited per minute between the two habitats. The time pollinators spent on each flower visit did not alter the percentage of pollinated flowers. Large pollinators typically landed on the tops of the flowers, whereas stingless bees and small carpenter bees approached flowers from both the top and side. Trigona collina was the most important pollinator in the CSO. It made the most frequent visits and contributed to 67% of teak flowers being pollinated. Its foraging time was high in the morning (10:00-12:00 h), which coincided with the receptive period of teak flowers. The behavior of other pollinators that may promote out-crossing is discussed.

In the first scenario, both the intergenet distance and flowering phenology influenced mating opportunity, while in the second scenario only intergenet distance influenced mating opportunity. Although the frequency distribution of pollen flow distance at the population level did not differ significantly between the two scenarios, the mean pollen flow distance of several flowers increased by more than 10 m as a result of variation in flowering phenology. Furthermore, accounting for flowering phenology predicted change in heterozygosity in the next generation from -0.04 to 0.07.

However, if plants are adequately served by generalist pollinators, successful reproduction, naturalisation and expansion into exotic habitats may occur. Rhododendron ponticum is very successful, ecologically damaging invasive plant in Britain and Ireland, but is in decline in its native Iberian habitat. It spreads locally by sending out lateral branches, but for longer distance dispersal it relies on sexually produced seeds. Little is known about R. ponticum's pollination ecology and breeding biology in invaded habitats. We examined the flower-visiting communities and maternal reproductive success of R. ponticum in native populations in southern Spain and in exotic ones in Ireland. R. ponticum in flowers are visited by various generalist (polylectic) pollinator species in both native and exotic habitats. Although different species visited flowers in Ireland and Spain, the flower visitation rate was not significantly different. Insects foraging on R. ponticum in Spain carried less R. ponticum pollen than their Irish counterparts, and carried fewer pollen types. Fruit production per inflorescence varied greatly within all populations but was significantly correlated with visitation at the population level. Nectar was significantly depleted by insects in some exotic populations, suggesting that this invasive species is providing a floral resource for native insects in some parts of Ireland.

This, in turn, could increase fitness by reducing inbreeding depression in progeny and promoting pollen export. The few previous investigations of this hypothesis have all involved bee-pollinated orchids and some have given contradictory results. We studied the effects of adding artificial nectar (sucrose solution) to the spurs of a non-rewarding long-proboscid fly-pollinated orchid, Disa pulchra. Addition of nectar significantly increased the number of flowers probed by flies (2.6-fold), the time spent on a flower (5.4-fold), the number of pollinia removed per inflorescence (4.8-fold) and the proportion of removed pollen involved in self-pollination (3.5-fold). The level of self-pollination increased dramatically with the number of flowers probed by flies. Experimental self-pollination resulted in fruits with only half as many viable seeds as those arising from cross-pollination. Pollinators were more likely to fly long distances (> 40 cm) when departing from non-rewarding inflorescences than when departing from rewarding ones. These findings provide support for the idea that floral deception serves to reduce pollinator-mediated self-pollination.",,,,"Johnson, Steven/P-2104-2019; Johnson, Steven D/F-1146-2010","Johnson, Steven/0000-0002-5114-5862; Johnson, Steven D/0000-0002-5114-5862",,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,FEB,2006,147,1,,,,,60,68,,10.1007/s00442-005-0254-6,,,,,,,WOS:000234601000008,16187105,,,,

Analogous pathologies are documented in an unconventional model organism that receives attention in research on systems theory, evolution, and aging. The honeybee (Apis mellifera) colony is an advanced integrative unit, a ""superorganism"" in which order is controlled via complex signaling cascades and surveillance schemes. A facultatively sterile caste, the workers, regulates patterns of growth, differentiation, homeostasis, and death. Workers differentiate into temporal phenotypes in response to dynamic social cues; chemosensory signals that can translate into dramatic physiological responses, including programmed cell death. Temporal worker forms function together, and effectively identify and terminate abnormal colony members ranging from embryos to adults. As long as this regulatory system is operational at a colony level, the unit survives and propagates. However, if the worker phenotypes that collectively govern order become too few or change into malignant forms that bypass control mechanisms to replicate aberrantly; order is replaced by disorder that ultimately leads to the destruction of the society. In this chapter we describe fundamental properties of honeybee social organization, and explore conditions that lead to states of disorder. Our hope is that this chapter will be an inspirational source for ongoing and future work in the field of cancer research.

The widespread distribution of this orchid species ( or species complex) suggests that there may be a number of different model and pollinator species throughout this range, and that additional studies are necessary to characterise its pollination adequately. In this study, the pollination of D. maculata in the Sydney region, mainly at Scheyville National Park, was compared with the results previously obtained in Victoria. At Scheyville National Park, Trichocolletes venustus was the only native bee species found in significant numbers, and the flowers it visited were almost exclusively the legumes Hardenbergia violacea and Daviesia ulicifolia ssp. ulicifolia. Fifty per cent ( 14 of 28) of captured male bees carried D. maculata orchid pollinaria, or remnants, which were identified by AFLP fingerprinting. Female bees, which appeared about 10-14 days after males, were not observed visiting the orchid or carrying orchid pollinaria. We confirmed that D. maculata flowers lack nectar, and noted that the pea-like flowers possess an UV false nectar guide comparable to the true UV nectar guide of the legume flowers. Colorimetric analysis showed the colour separation between D. ulicifolia ssp. ulicifolia and the orchid is small enough to be likely to produce foraging errors, consistent with mimicry. We conclude that guild mimicry of a diversity of 'egg and bacon' legumes best explains the pollination of D. maculata s.l., rather than precise mimicry of any one pea species. Preliminary observations suggest that pea-flower mimicry may range from being highly precise in some species, through to being much more generalised, but still retaining elements of mimicry. The novel finding of comparable UV patterns in Diuris species and putative pea models applies to most species in the genus and we found that the rare D. aequalis shows remarkable similarity in colour, shape and UV patterns to the sympatric legume Gompholobium huegelii, and is likely to be a mimic of this species.",,,,"Whelan, Robert/E-3670-2010; Clements, Mark/F-9555-2011","Weston, Peter/0000-0001-8920-5376; Batley, Michael/0000-0001-9191-4286",,,,,,,,,,,,0067-1924,,,,,,2006,54,7,,,,,669,679,,10.1071/BT05146,,,,,,,WOS:000241364400005,,,,,

One strategy for efficient foraging used by bumblebees is near-far search, involving short flights when in good patches of flowers and longer flights when in poor patches. Bumblebees also demonstrate the use of a spatial memory strategy by returning repeatedly to patches of flowers, and even following the same route between flowers, over periods of days. We attempted to determine at what spatial scales bumblebees use spatial memory while foraging within a patch and after how many flower visits spatial memory outweighs near-far search. Bumblebees in the laboratory foraged on a 4 x 4 array of artificial flowers with distances ranging from 10 to 80 cm between flowers in two simple spatial patterns. The proportion of visits to flowers containing a sucrose reward was monitored for either 100 or 400 flower visits in two separate experiments, after which the locations of the rewarding and nonrewarding flowers were interchanged, producing a mirror image. A drop in accuracy after the mirror image switch would indicate that the bees had memorized the location of rewarding flowers. Mirror image tests, and comparisons to a simulation model of near-far search based on actual flight distances, indicate that naive bumblebees used near-far search on flowers 10 cm apart but increasingly used spatial memory as experience and spatial separation increased.

To determine the landscape characteristics that facilitate the occurrence of B. muscorum, grid-based observation records were analysed in a GIS environment at a regional scale. A significantly negative effect of the number of trees on the occurrence of B. muscorum and a significantly positive one of the proportion of arable land, strongly support the species' preference for open landscapes. Yet, apart from open landscapes additional landscape features were shown to be important. A significantly positive effect of ditches in the final model revealed the importance of this landscape element for the occurrence of B. muscorum. This finding was additionally supported by recordings of nest-searching queens, nests, and flower visits along dithes. The positive effects of clover and fallow land indicate the species' need for suitable food resources throughout the season. Because B. muscorum exhibits small foraging ranges, it is essential that landscape elements that provide nesting sites, foraging habitats and undisturbed hibernation structures are next to each other.

We evaluated whether local temporal dynamics of ecological outcome in the interaction between the moth Greya politella (Prodoxidae) and its host plant Lithophragma parviflorum (Saxifragaceae) are likely to mitigate or magnify geographic differences in ecological outcome found in earlier studies. The moths are highly host-specific pollinating floral parasites, and the mutualism can be swamped in some populations by the presence of effective co-pollinators. Hence, differing community contexts can shift the outcome of the interaction from mutualism to commensalism or antagonism. During each of four years, we evaluated the effect of Greya oviposition on seed development through a paired design that controlled for plant genotype and microenvironment. At Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge in Washington State, the interaction was significantly mutualistic in all four years. Mutualism in this population was indicated by a higher probability of development of capsules visited by ovipositing Greya than capsules not visited by Greya on the same plant. At Rapid River, Idaho, the interaction was commensalistic in three years and antagonistic in one year. Antagonism in this population was indicated by selective withering of capsules containing Greya eggs.

The results for this absolute conditioning function and a previously determined function for differential conditioning were compared, and it is shown that the absolute conditioning function best explains the discrimination and flower constancy behaviour of bees that has previously been observed in natural settings. Modeling of the empirically determined absolute discrimination function allows for predictions of how bees would discriminate between flowers in complex foraging conditions that might include changes in the background and/or illumination colour. The absolute conditioning function should thus serve as an important guide for the evaluation of pollinator discriminations between flowers in natural settings, and for the understanding of why there may have been considerable evolutionary pressure on plants to evolve distinctive flower colours so as to promote flower constancy in important pollinators.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8177,,,,,,2006,28,4,,,,,257,268,,,,,,,,,WOS:000239749300002,,,,,

However, mouse sperm lacking PH-20 were still capable of penetrating the cumulus mass despite a delayed dispersal of cumulus cells. Intriguingly, a 55-kDa hyaluronan-hydrolyzing protein was abundantly present in wild-type and PH-20-deficient mouse sperm. In this study, we purified the 55-kDa mouse protein from soluble protein extracts released from epididymal sperm by acrosome reaction and identified as a hyaluronidase, HyaI5. HyaI5 was exclusively expressed in the testis and formed a 160-kbp gene cluster together with HyaIp1, HyaI4, and Ph-20 on mouse chromosome 6. HyaI5 was a single-chain hyaluronidase present on the plasma and acrosomal membranes of sperm presumably as a GPI-anchored protein. Moreover, hyaluronan zymography revealed that HyaI5 is enzymatically active in the pH range 5-7 and inactive at pH 3 and 4. Both HyaI5-enriched PH-20-free soluble protein extracts and PH-20-deficient mouse sperm were capable of dispersing cumulus cells from the cumulus mass. Cumulus cell dispersal was strongly inhibited by the presence of a hyaluronidase inhibitor, apigenin. These results suggest that in the mouse, HyaI5 may function principally as a ""cumulus matrix depolymerase"" in the sperm penetration through the cumulus mass and in the local hyaluronan hydrolysis near or on the surface of the egg zona pellucida to enable the proximal region of sperm tail to move freely. PH-20 may compensate in part for the functional roles of HyaI5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,,,,,Dec-13,2005,102,50,,,,,18028,18033,,10.1073/pnas.0506825102,,,,,,,WOS:000234010500028,16330764,,,,

Normally, the path integrator is reset to the zero state whenever the ant returns to the starting point of its foraging journey, the nest. We investigated whether the landmark panorama characterizing the nest entrance suffices to reset the path integrator. We designed an experimental paradigm in which the position where the ants' path integrator was at the zero state (PI position) did not coincide with the position of the nest as marked by the familiar landmark panorama (LM position). Once the ants displaced from the training area to a distant test field had arrived at the PI position, the artificial landmark array defining the nest site was installed at the LM position. The ants immediately headed towards the LM position and searched there persistently. However, upon removal of the landmarks they returned to the PI position. Hence, they ignored information from their path integrator while they concentrated their search at the landmark-defined nest position, but they again relied on their continually updated path integrator as soon as the landmarks had been removed. Although their concentrated search at the LM position showed that the ants had used the landmarks as reliable cues for the position of their nest, this landmark-induced search for the nest entrance did not reset the ant's path integrator. In general, this might mean that geocentric visual cues in themselves are not sufficient to recalibrate the egocentric path integrator. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

LRI values, areas of each landscape habitat type, and the diversity and abundance of bumble bee-used flowering ramets at each site were compared with bumble bee diversity and abundance at the site. Bumble bee diversity was best predicted by a model including the LRI of grasslands surrounding sites at 500 in, which explained most of the variance, and the abundance of humble bee-visited plants at the site. Bumble bee abundance was best predicted by a model including the percent of the landscape in grasslands at the 700-m radius, which explained most of the variance, and the abundance of bumble bee-visited plants at the site.

In landscapes influenced by anthropogenic activities, such as intensive agriculture, knowledge of the relative importance and interaction of environmental factors on the composition and function of local communities across a range of spatial scales is important for maintaining biodiversity. 2. We analysed five arthropod taxa covering a broad range of functional aspects (wild bees, true bugs, carabid beetles, hoverflies and spiders) in 24 landscapes (4 x 4 km) across seven European countries along gradients of both land-use intensity and landscape structure. Species-environment relationships were examined in a hierarchical design of four main sets of environmental factors (country, land-use intensity, landscape structure, local habitat properties) that covered three spatial scales (region, landscape, local) by means of hierarchical variability partitioning using partial canonical correspondence analyses. 3. Local community composition and the distribution of body size classes and trophic guilds were most affected by regional processes, which highly confounded landscape and local factors. After correcting for regional effects, factors at the landscape scale dominated over local habitat factors. Land-use intensity explained most of the variability in species data, whereas landscape characteristics (especially connectivity) accounted for most of the variability in body size and trophic guilds. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that management effort should be focused on land-use intensity and habitat connectivity in order to enhance diversity in agricultural landscapes. Since these factors are largely independent, specific conservation programmes may be developed with regards to socio-economic and agri-environmental requirements. Changes in either of these factors will enhance diversity but will also result in specific effects on local communities related to dispersal ability and the resource use of species.",,,,"Schweiger, Oliver/B-4909-2008; Frenzel, Mark/D-4778-2015; Diekotter, Tim/L-2463-2016; Liira, Jaan/G-9879-2015; Hendrickx, Frederik/F-3149-2013; Herzog, Felix/B-1911-2009","Schweiger, Oliver/0000-0001-8779-2335; Frenzel, Mark/0000-0003-1068-2394; Liira, Jaan/0000-0001-8863-0098; Bugter, Rob/0000-0002-7110-4419",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,DEC,2005,42,6,,,,,1129,1139,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01085.x,,,,,,,WOS:000233515200014,,,,,

We re-examine the phylogeny of this genus, using an expanded set of taxa from Madagascar and Malawi and additional sequence data, in order to determine the number of dispersals and the timeframe over which they occurred. Location Africa, Madagascar, Malawi, Asia and Australia. Methods One nuclear (EF-1 alpha F2) and two mitochondrial (CO1 and Cyt b) gene regions were sequenced for 36 allodapine bee species (including members of the genera Braunsapis, Nasutapis, Allodape, Allodapula, and Macrogalea) and one ceratinine species (Ceratina japonica). We used Bayesian analyses to examine phylogenetic structure and a penalized likelihood approach to estimate approximate ages for key divergences in our phylogeny. Results Our analyses indicate a tropical African origin for Braunsapis in the early Miocene followed by very early dispersal into Asia and then a subsequent dispersal, following Asian diversification, into Australia during the late Miocene. There have also been two dispersals of Braunsapis from Africa to Madagascar and this result, when combined with phylogenetic and biogeographical data for other allodapines, suggests that these bees have the ability to cross moderately large ocean expanses. These dispersals may have been aided by the West Wind Drift, but rafting across the Mozambique Channel is also possible, and could be aided by the existence of developmental stages that require minimal or no feeding and by tolerance to sea water and spume. Accumulating evidence suggests that many biogeographical patterns in the southern hemisphere may be better explained by dispersal than by Gondwanan vicariance hypotheses. Our results add to this growing body of data and raise the possibility that some puzzling trans-Indian Ocean distributions may also be explained by historical dispersal events across oceanic barriers that now seem insuperable.",,,,"Fuller, Susan/I-9584-2012; Tierney, Simon/H-2410-2015; Tierney, Simon/O-6911-2019","Tierney, Simon/0000-0002-8812-6753; Tierney, Simon/0000-0002-8812-6753; Fuller, Susan/0000-0003-4399-0166",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,,,,,DEC,2005,32,12,,,,,2135,2144,,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01354.x,,,,,,,WOS:000233408500008,,,,,

Interestingly, the precision by which dancers transfer directional information is negatively correlated with the distance to the advertised food source. The 'tuned-error' hypothesis suggests that colonies benefit from this imprecision as it spreads recruits out over a patch of constant size irrespective of the distance to the advertised site. An alternative to the tuned-error hypothesis is that dancers are physically incapable of dancing with great precision for nearby sources. Here we revisit the tuned-error hypothesis by studying the change in dance precision with increasing foraging distance over relatively short distances while controlling for environmental influences. We show that bees indeed increase their dance precision with the increase in foraging distance. However, we also show that dances performed by swarm-scouts for a nearby (30 in) nest site, where there could be no benefit to imprecision, are either without or with only limited directional information.

Metabolic rates of individuals are measured in a running tube respirometer while they are unladen and laden at 25 degrees C. Workers voluntarily collect a load of 6 mu L of a 30% sucrose solution (mass = 6.8 mg), which results in an internal load of about 50% of the ant mass and is close to a full load for ants within this size range. The gross cost of unladen running is 264 J kg(-1) m(-1), while that of laden running is 225 J kg(-1) m(-1). The mass used to calculate the cost of laden running includes body mass of ant and load carried. Load carriage cost in C. rufipes foragers is calculated to be about 60% as much as body carriage per unit mass.

However, an unsolved problem concerns the inherent stochasticity involved in many animal search displacements and its possible adaptive value. When animals have no information about where targets (i.e., resource patches, mates, etc.) are located, different random search strategies may provide different chances to find them. Assuming random-walk models as a necessary tool to understand how animals face such environmental uncertainty, we analyze the statistical differences between two random-walk models commonly used to fit animal movement data, the Levy walks and the correlated random walks, and we quantify their efficiencies (i.e., the number of targets found in relation to total displacement) within a random search context. Correlated random-walk properties (i.e., scale-finite correlations) may be interpreted as the by-product of locally scanning mechanisms. Levy walks, instead, have fundamental properties (i.e., super-diffusivity and scale invariance) that allow a higher efficiency in random search scenarios. Specific biological mechanisms related to how animals punctuate their movement with sudden reorientations in a random search would be sufficient to, sustain Levy walk properties. Furthermore, we investigate a new model (the Levy-modulated correlated random walk) that combines the properties of correlated and Levy walks. This model shows that Levy walk properties are robust to any behavioral mechanism providing short-range correlations in the walk.

Recent work suggests that bees measure distance flown in terms of the extent of image motion (integrated optic flow) that is experienced during flight. However, it is known that optic flow also regulates the speed of flight. Therefore, the duration of the flight to a destination is likely to co-vary with the optic flow that is experienced en route. This makes it difficult to tease apart the potential roles of flight duration and optic flow as cues in estimating distance flown. Here we examine whether flight duration alone can serve as an indicator of distance. We trained bees to visit feeders at two sites located in optically different environments, but positioned such that the flight durations to the two sites were similar. The distance estimates for the two sites, as reported in the waggle dance, were compared. We found that dances differed significantly between the two sites, even though flight times were similar. Flight time perse was a poor predictor of waggle dance behaviour. We conclude that foraging bees do not simply signal flight time as their measure of distance in the waggle dance; the environment through which they fly plays a dominant role.",,,,"Srinivasan, Mandyam/G-5571-2010","Barron, Andrew/0000-0002-8135-6628; Muthukumarasamy, Srinivasan/0000-0002-2948-6206",,,,,,,,,,,,0020-1812,,,,,NOV,2005,52,4,,,,,402,407,,10.1007/s00040-005-0827-8,,,,,,,WOS:000233730600017,,,,,

When the two cue sources were set in conflict, by shifting the position of the landmark in the tunnel during test, bees overwhelmingly used landmark cues rather than odometry. In another experiment, odometric cues were removed by training and testing in axially striped tunnels. The data show that bees did not weight landmarks as highly as when odometric cues were available, tending to search in the vicinity of the landmark for shorter periods. A third experiment, in which bees were trained with odometry but without a landmark, showed that a novel landmark placed anywhere in the tunnel during testing prevented bees from searching beyond the landmark location. Two further experiments, involving training bees to relatively longer distances with a goal-defining landmark, produced similar results to the initial experiment. One caveat was that, with the removal of the familiar landmark, bees tended to overshoot the training location, relative to the case where bees were trained without a landmark.

However, although dance communication has been studied extensively, little is known about how the dancers combine the compass (direction) and the odometric (distance) information they acquire during the foraging flight. In the present study, we analysed the encoding of spatial information in the waggle dance by manipulating the navigational information provided to dancing bees. To this end, we took advantage of the bees' visually driven odometer. We found that the waggle dance basically encodes information on the distance gauged during the outbound (hive-to-food) flight. However, it does not necessarily refer to a global vector based on path integration of the outbound flight. Whenever the direction connecting the subjective food location and the hive does not match the direction of the global vector, dancers refer to a direction close to that of the shortcut connecting the actual food location and the hive. Moreover, in our experiments, this direction was close to that of the inbound (food-to-hive) flight, indicating that landmark-based information is computed during the inbound flight and that it may strongly affect the encoding of directional information in the waggle dance.

At food sources, there is an increase of approximately 0.9'C in thoracic temperature (T-th) per 1 mol 1(-1) increase in sucrose concentration (at 20 m distance from nest: 1 mol 1-1 sucrose concentration, T-th=36.6 +/- 0.80 degrees C, T-a=31.3 +/- 0.50 degrees C; 2.5 mol 1(-1) sucrose concentration, T-th=36.9 +/- 0.60 degrees C, T,=29.9 +/- 0.20 degrees C). Inside the nest, the difference between thoracic temperature Tth and ambient air temperature T, (Delta T-nest) decreases by 0.4 degrees C with each 100 m increase in feeder-to-nest distance and increases by 0.1 degrees C per 1 mol 1-1 increase in sucrose concentration. The Tth Of returning foragers was significantly higher at all tested sucrose concentrations (1.0-2.5 mol 1-1 sucrose concentration) and distances (25-437 m) as compared to T-a (at 2.5 mol 1-1 sucrose concentration: 25 m distance from nest, intranidal T-th=30.2 +/- 1.3 degrees C, T-a=24.8 +/- 0.70 degrees C; 437 m distance from nest, intranidal T-th=28.6 +/- 1.7 degrees C, T-nest=25.4 +/- 1.4 degrees C). For highly profitable food sources (2.5 mol 1(-1) sucrose concentration and <= 100 m from the nest), forager T-th was slightly higher than that of randomly chosen control bees inside the nest.",,,,"Sanchez, Daniel/Q-1872-2018; Nieh, James/H-8705-2014","Sanchez, Daniel/0000-0003-1261-5320; Nieh, James/0000-0001-6237-0726",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,OCT,2005,208,20,,,,,3933,3943,,10.1242/jeb.01792,,,,,,,WOS:000233218900012,16215220,,,,

The best-studied communication behaviour in this context is the waggle dance performed by returning foragers, which encodes information about the distance and direction to the food source. It has been suggested that another information cue, floral scents transferred within the hive, is also important for recruitment to food sources, as bee recruits are more strongly attracted to odours previously brought back by foragers in both honeybees and bumble-bees. These observations suggested that honeybees learn the odour from successful foragers before leaving the hive. However, this has never been shown directly and the mechanisms and properties of the learning process remain obscure. We tested the learning and memory of recruited bees in the laboratory using the proboscis extension response (PER) paradigm, and show that recruits indeed learn the nectar odours brought back by foragers by associative learning and retrieve this memory in the PER paradigm. The associative nature of this learning reveals that information was gained during mouth-to-mouth contacts among bees (trophallaxis). Results further suggest that the information is transferred to long-term memory. Associative learning of food odours in a social context may help recruits to find a particular food source faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,Sep-22,2005,272,1575,,,,,1923,1928,,10.1098/rspb.2005.3172,,,,,,,WOS:000231799900008,16191598,,,,

We focused on its reproductive biology and pollinator behavior to explain its reproductive success. We performed manual pollination and germination experiments, and monitored the behavior of C retusa's main pollinators in monospecific plots, and in mixed plots where C retusa occurred together with two congeners, Crotalaria pallida and Crotalaria lanceolata. Crotalaria retusa is self-compatible and capable of automatic selfing. Inbreeding depression was expressed at the level of percent seed germination, but not seed set. Few insects visited the inflorescences. Legitimate pollinators were two large carpenter bees, Xylocopa frontalis and Xylocopa grisescens which, together, accounted for more than 90 percent of the visits. The former foraged on C retusa exclusively and has low pollen spread potential. The latter flew longer distances between plants and visited fewer flowers per inflorescence, potentially increasing the extent of pollen carryover, but at the risk of increasing heterospecific pollen transfer, because it visits other Crotalaria species during the same foraging bout. The different foraging strategies, allied to morphological disadvantages represented by pollen overlap on X grisescens' body, may partially explain the much lower seed germination observed in C pallida and C lanceolata. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a reduction in flower constancy may significantly depress viable seed set by increasing the chances of self-pollination.",,,,"Ramalho, Mauro/K-7178-2014; Jacobi, Claudia/B-7510-2013","Ramalho, Mauro/0000-0001-8287-7479; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3606,,,,,SEP,2005,37,3,,,,,357,363,,10.1111/j.1744-7429.2005.00047.x,,,,,,,WOS:000231304500006,,,,,

At the start of a potential foraging period, they may set out independently or await information from returning foragers. When should such individuals act independently and when should they wait for information? In a social insect colony, for example, information transfer may greatly increase a recruit's probability of finding food, and it is commonly assumed that this will always increase the colony's net energy gain. We test this assumption with a mathematical model. Energy gain by a colony is a function both of the probability of finding food sources and of the duration of their availability. A key factor is the ratio of pro-active foragers to re-active foragers. When leaving the nest, pro-active foragers search for food independently, whereas re-active foragers rely on information from successful foragers to find food. Under certain conditions, the optimum strategy is totally independent (pro-active) foraging because potentially valuable information that re-active foragers may gain from successful foragers is not worth waiting for. This counter-intuitive outcome is remarkably robust over a wide range of parameters. It occurs because food sources are only available for a limited period.

We show that nectar foraging rate ( mass gathered per unit time) is positively correlated with worker size, in accordance with previous studies. It has been suggested that the greater foraging rate of large bees is due to their higher thermoregulatory capacity in cool conditions, but our data suggest that this is not so. Workers differing in size were not differentially affected by the weather. Regardless of size, naive bees were poor foragers, often using more resources than they gathered. Foraging rate was not maximised until at least 30 trips had been made from the nest. Foraging rates were positively correlated with humidity, perhaps because nectar secretion rates were higher or evaporation of nectar lower at high humidity. Temperature, wind speed and cloud cover did not significantly influence foraging rate, within the summertime range that occurred during the study. Weather greatly influenced whether bees collected pollen or nectar. Pollen was preferably collected when it was warm, windy, and particularly when humidity was low; and preferably during the middle of the day.

We used a comparative approach to test whether rarity is associated with reproductive biology in two closely-related species pairs. This system has been recently altered by changes in fire regimes and the introduction of European honeybees. More than 35% of flowers matured fruits in the common species after natural-pollination compared to < 20% of flowers in the rare species. All species were obligate outcrossers in each of the study populations, but only the two rare species were pollen-limited, having significantly lower fruit-set on open-pollinated flowers than those cross-pollinated by hand (mean SE; 0.18 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.42 +/- 0.05; p < 0.001). Native bees (Leioproctus species) and introduced honeybees (Apis mellifera) visited all species. The native bees visited fewer flowers within a plant and moved greater distances between plants while foraging than honeybees, so the native bees are expected to be more effective in promoting outcrossing. While honeybees were the most frequent visitors to flowers of all species, native bees made more visits to common than rare species (0.65 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.20 +/- 0.09). Our results suggest that the poorer reproductive success in rare Persoonia species is associated with lower pollinator effectiveness, which is exacerbated by frequent fires and introduced honeybees.

Pollen can be transported thousands of kilometres by insects but its viability after long-distance transport is not known. Knowing the potential for this mechanism to cause outcrossing of transgenes from genetically modified (GM) plants is important for risk assessments. 2. The viability of pollen from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and canola (Brassica napus L.) was determined after placing it on the proboscis of Helicoverpa armigera moths for intervals of up to 32 h. Viability of both cotton and canola pollen declined at a much greater rate when in contact with the moth proboscis. Most was non-viable by 8 h compared with 16 h for control cotton pollen or 32 h for canola pollen. 3. There was no significant difference in the rate of decline of pollen viability between the five conventional cotton varieties, or between these and the one GM cotton variety used in these experiments. 4. The number of canola pollen grains remaining on the proboscis declined over time. Very few cotton pollen grains were retained on the proboscis. 5.

Can animals with adequate cognitive abilities increase their efficiency by modifying their behavior according to memories of past experience at particular sites? We developed a simulation model of animals harvesting renewable resources from isolated patches in undefended, competitive situations. We compared four foraging tactics: (1) moving stochastically without using any information from past experiences (random searching); (2) moving stochastically, but going longer distances after encountering lower reward (area-restricted searching); (3) repeatedly moving along a fixed route (complete traplining); and (4) traplining, but sampling and shifting to neighboring rewarding patches after encountering low reward (sample-and-shift traplining). Following Possingham, we tracked both the resources actually harvested by a focal forager (i.e., rewards) and the standing crops of resources that accumulated at patches. Complete traplining always produces less variation in elapsed time between visits than random searching or area-restricted searching, which has three benefits: increasing the reward crop harvested, if resource renews nonlinearly; reducing resource standing crop in patches; and reducing variation in reward crop per patch. Moreover, the systematic revisitation schedule produced by complete traplining makes it more competitive, regardless of resource renewal schedule or competitor frequency. By responding to their past experiences, using sample-and-shift traplining, foragers benefit only when many patches are left unvisited in the habitat. Otherwise, the exploratory component of sample-and-shift traplining, which increases the movement distance and the variation in elapsed time between visits, makes it more costly than complete traplining. Thus, traplining will usually be beneficial, but foragers should switch between ""impatient"" (sample-and-shift traplining) and ""tenacious"" (complete traplining) traplining, according to temporal changes in surrounding situations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045-2249,,,,,MAY,2005,16,3,,,,,592,605,,10.1093/beheco/ari031,,,,,,,WOS:000228402100013,,,,,

The fruit would produce seeds if cross-pollination with compatible pollen source occurred. It is almost impossible to prevent cross-pollination between compatible mandarin cultivars by honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) within the multi-faceted agricultural environment in California. To produce seedless mandarin, growers either plant a single cultivar in a large solid block or try to use pollen-sterile navel oranges (C. sinensis) or satsuma mandarins (C. unshiu Marco.) as buffers to prevent cross-pollination. The question of how many rows of buffer trees or spacing can effectively prevent cross-pollination by honeybees between compatible mandarins is unclear. We initiated a study using fluorescent-labeled AFLP markers to determine the pollen parentages of 'Nules' clementine seedlings and 'Afourer' mandarin seedlings from two orchards in California. The longest distance of pollen flow at an orchard near Madera was 521 m. The pollen of 'Minneola' tangelo (C. reticulata x C. paradisi Macf.) was able to disperse across a minimum of 92 rows of 'Lane Late' navel oranges plus two rows of 'Afourer' mandarins to pollinate 'Afourer' mandarins.

The pollen of 'Afourer' mandarin was able to disperse up to distances between 837 and 960 m to pollinate 'Nules' clementine.

Knowledge of their ecology is vital for the design of effective management and conservation strategies but key aspects remain poorly understood. Here we employed microsatellite markers to estimate and compare foraging range and nest density among four UK species: Bombus terrestris, Bombus pascuorum, Bombus lapidarius, and Bombus pratorum. Workers were sampled along a 1.5-km linear transect across arable farmland. Eight or nine polymorphic microsatellite markers were then used to identify putative sisters. In accordance with previous studies, minimum estimated maximum foraging range was greatest for B. terrestris (758 m) and least for B. pascuorum (449 m). The estimate for B. lapidarius was similar to B. pascuorum (450 m), while that of B. pratorum was intermediate (674 m). Since the area of forage available to bees increases as the square of foraging range, these differences correspond to a threefold variation in the area used by bumblebee nests of different species. Possible explanations for these differences are discussed. Estimates for nest density at the times of sampling were 29, 68, 117, and 26/km(2) for B. terrestris, B. pascuorum, B. lapidarius and B. pratorum, respectively.

In this study, I extracted this overstrike effect on the plant choices of pollinators by analyzing patterns of visitation sequences within a single round-trip between the hive and foraging patch (bout). First, I simulated the visitation sequences within single bouts with a model to show how factors, including the bees' plant-type preferences, the arrangement of plants and the effect of overstrike on short-term memory, affect visitation sequences. Here, bees are assumed to forage in a patch consisting of two plant types (H and L). The model predicts that only the effect of overstrike on short-term memory causes assorted visitation sequences according to plant type (within-bout flower constancy). That is, if the overstrike-effect on short-term memory is the primary determinant of plant choice, then bees will fly to a type-L plant after visiting a type-L plant even if they predominantly visit type-H plants and vice versa. Next, I investigated individual bumblebees' visitation sequences at a patch of artificial inflorescences with a set-up similar to that assumed in the model. Two types of inflorescences were arranged on a Cartesian grid. Assorted visitation sequences according to inflorescence type were observed, depending on the distances among inflorescences. This result supports the hypotheses that bees fly to the same plant type as that last visited because short-term memory is displaced (overstruck) with information about the most recently visited plant type.",,,,"Ishii, Hiroshi/G-6179-2012; Ishii, Hiroshi/J-9660-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,,,,,APR,2005,57,6,,,,,599,610,,10.1007/s00265-004-0889-z,,,,,,,WOS:000228997300009,,,,,

Workers of their relatives within the Apidae exhibit much less size variation. 2. For the bumblebee Bombus terrestris size, as measured by thorax width, was found to correspond closely with tongue length, so that larger bees are equipped to feed from deeper flowers. 3. The mean size of worker bees attracted to flowers was found to differ between plant species, and larger bees with longer tongues tended to visit deeper flowers. 4. Finally, handling time depended on the match between corolla depth and tongue length: large bees were slower than small bees when handling shallow flowers, but quicker than small bees when handling deep flowers. 5.

At each choice point, they recognize a few cues in the range of positions where the cues occurred during the learning process. There is no need to postulate that they reassemble the surrounding panorama in memory; only that they retain memories of the coincidences of cues in the expected retinotopic directions. The cues could be stimuli that excite groups of peripheral visual neurons. All the experimentally known cues are described, including modulation of the receptors, the locations of areas of black or colour, the nearness, size, averaged edge orientation, and radial and tangential edges. Cues of each type are separately summed within large fields, the size of which varies with the cue. Local orientation cues from edges at right angles cancel each other within each field, which also suggests that the discrimination of shape and texture is limited. Resolution depends on lateral interactions and the number of ommatidia required for each cue. To identify a new place, a few sparse cues, together with their directions, are learned in orientation flights. When the bee returns, the cues in the panorama are progressively matched as they coincide with the cues in memory. The limited number of cues, though economical for memory, may restrict the foraging behaviour and lead to flower constancy.

Here we examine which factors render some British bumblebee species more susceptible to environmental change than others. We present forage data on workers of 15 bumblebee species gathered from 172 one hour searches conducted at sites in southern UK, the Hebrices (western Scotland) and in New Zealand (to which UK bumblebees were introduced). We also review data on distribution, phenology and tongue length of these species. Overall, Fabaceae appear to be the major pollen source for most bumblebee species. In particular, long-tongued, late emerging species such as Bombus ruderatus, Bombus humilis and Bombus subterraneus specialize heavily in gathering pollen from Fabaceae, and this group of bumblebee species have all declined. Some of them are also at the edge of their geographic range in the UK, which may have rendered them more sensitive to environmental change. The decline of many bumblebee species is probably attributable largely to the loss of unimproved flower-rich grasslands, a habitat rich in Fabaceae. The bumblebee species that remain abundant are mostly short-tongued species that emerge early in the season and have less specialized diets: these species are very common in suburban gardens where they are able to exploit the broad range of floral resources. A third group of bumblebees are strongly associated with Ericaceae in moorland and heathland habitats, and have probably always had restricted distributions. A small number of species are not so easily categorised. Bombus soroeensis and B. ruderarius are not dietary specialists, nor are they close to the limit of their geographic range, but nevertheless they have declined.

Bumblebees were monitored on 120 field margins in July and August, together with estimates of flower abundance and the vegetation composition. There were no differences in the abundance and diversity of the bumblebee assemblage between the two regions (East Anglia and the West Midlands), despite a greater abundance of flowers and flowering species on the lighter soils of the West Midlands. Very few bumblebees were recorded on intensively managed cereal field margins due to the lack of dicot species. Conservation headlands supported a significantly greater number of flowering dicots, but the majority of these were annuals which did not provide good forage for bumblebees. From an agronomic and ecological perspective, the removal of field margins from the cropping system was the best strategy for providing foraging habitat for bumblebees. Non-crop habitat resulting from natural regeneration provided good foraging habitat for bumblebee species, but most of the key forage species were pernicious weeds of agriculture (Cirsium spp.). Sowing non-crop field margins with wildlife seed mixtures had the potential for providing the best foraging habitat for bumblebees, so long as preferred forage species were introduced (e.g. Trifolium pratense).

The western honeybee, Apis mellifera, has been introduced to-many parts of the world and is sometimes purported to be detrimental to native bees because it reduces their food base. It is seldom viewed in this light in Europe; however, when beekeepers maintain very high bee densities, the species could also be displacing insects in its native European range by reducing the resource base. 2. In England, populations of bumblebees (Bombus Latr. Hym.) have been decreasing both in terms of diversity and abundance, mainly because of a loss of habitat resulting from agricultural intensification. The impact of competition from other flower feeders is largely unknown. 3. Nineteen dry lowland heaths in southern England were sampled once for honeybees and bumblebees. Honeybee abundance varied from 4 to 81 bees per 100m(2) (mean = 30.89, median = 23), whereas bumblebees varied from 2 to 17 individuals per 100m(2) (mean = 8.26, median = 7), belonging to between one and five species. There was a negative association between honeybee and bumblebee abundance but there was no apparent relationship between honeybee abundance and bumblebee diversity. 4. The Bray-Curtis coefficient was used to compare the similarity in honeybee and bumblebee floral host breadth at these 19 sites. The coefficient was negatively associated with honeybee abundance: thus where honeybees were most abundant, bumblebees were fewer and/or foraged on different flower species. 5. Foraging host breadth was also examined at four heathlands over a field season (April to September). No association between honeybee abundance and foraging host breadth was found for short-tongued bees, although there was some evidence for a change in floral host breadth for long-tongued bees. 6. It is concluded that the impact of honeybees on bumblebees is complex. Although competition between the two species cannot be ruled out, it is perhaps equally likely that bumblebees decline in response to other factors, and that honeybees move independently of this decline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,1365-2311,,,,FEB,2005,30,1,,,,,47,57,,10.1111/j.0307-6946.2005.00660.x,,,,,,,WOS:000226922200006,,,,,

We worked in an experimental landscape consisting of 40 >= 1-ha patches of early-successional habitat in a matrix of forest. Within each of eight experimental units, two patches were connected by a corridor (150 x 25 m), and three were not. Patch shape varied to control for the area added by the presence of a corridor. Differences in patch shape also allowed us to test alternative hypotheses of how corridors might function. The Traditional Corridor Hypothesis posits that corridors increase immigration and emigration by functioning as movement conduits between patches. The Drift Fence Hypothesis posits that corridors function by ""capturing"" organisms dispersing through the matrix, redirecting them into associated habitat patches. Using fluorescent powder to track pollen, we found that pollen transfer by butterflies between patches connected by a corridor was significantly higher than between unconnected patches (all values mean +/- 1 SE: 59% +/- 9.2% vs. 25% +/- 5.2% of flowers receiving pollen). Likewise, pollen transfer by bees and wasps was significantly higher between connected patches than between unconnected patches (30% +/- 4.2% vs. 14.5% +/- 2.2%). These results support the Traditional Corridor Hypothesis. There was little support, however, for the Drift Fence Hypothesis. To generalize our results to a larger scale, we measured the probability of pollen transfer by butterflies as a function of distance along a 2000 x 75 m corridor. Pollen transfer probability exponentially declined with respect to distance and successfully predicted pollen transfer probability on the scale of our previous experiment. These results suggest that corridors facilitate pollen transfer in fragmented landscapes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,FEB,2005,86,2,,,,,466,475,,10.1890/03-0607,,,,,,,WOS:000227634400022,,,,,

In contrast to other social bees, bumble-bees exhibit considerable size variation within the worker caste. This size variation has not been adequately explained, although it is known that larger workers tend to be foragers and smaller bees spend more time in the nest. We quantify size variation and mean size for foragers of 22 bumble-bee species inhabiting climates ranging from arctic and montane to the lowland tropics. 2. Mean size was larger in bee species from cold climates compared with temperate bumble-bees. Within species, individuals from Scotland tended to be larger than those from southern England. However, tropical bumble-bees (mostly belonging to the subgenus Fervidobombus) were largest of all. We suggest that although a lower limit to size may be imposed by inhabiting cold climates, overheating does not constrain large size in bumble-bees from hot climates, perhaps because they have efficient mechanisms for heat loss through shunting heat to their extremities. 3. Tropical bees had shorter thoracic setae than species from cooler climates, while B. terrestris from Greece had shorter setae than those from southern UK. Presumably shorter setae enhance heat loss in warm climates. 4. Larger workers of B. terrestris were found to have smaller extremities, in proportion to their size, than small workers. We suggest that heat retention is more important in large bees that spend more of their time foraging, than in small bees which spend much of their time in the nest where incubation of the brood requires them to lose heat. 5. In the temperate climate of southern UK, we found no evidence for ambient temperature having a differential effect on activity of workers of B. terrestris according to their size. We suggest that, at least in temperate climates, size variation in bumble-bee foragers is probably not an adaptation to temperature variation. Instead it may improve colony foraging efficiency since foragers of different sizes are suited to, and tend to visit, different flower species.",,,,"Ellis, Jonathan/A-4223-2011; Goulson, David/A-2462-2010","Goulson, David/0000-0003-4421-2876; Ellis, Jonathan/0000-0002-6655-4685",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,FEB,2005,19,1,,,,,145,151,,10.1111/j.0269-8463.2005.00946.x,,,,,,,WOS:000227672000019,,,,,

The ability to discriminate among scents may depend on both scent intensity and the ratios of the concentrations of the volatile compounds of a complex mixture rather than on the presence of a few compounds.

Cultivars were reliably classifed by their scents in a canonical discriminant analysis. Honeybees were unable to discriminate among the scents of flowers of the same cultivar in our assay. The ability of honeybees to discriminate among the scents of different cultivars was a function of the intensity of the. oral scent.

When there is a single plant species, no level of nectar concealment is evolutionarily stable: any population can be invaded by mutants exhibiting a higher level of nectar concealment. However, the presence of a second flower species with exposed nectar and not subject to evolution breaks the runaway process. In the presence of open flowers, depending on the fitness function there may be an evolutionarily stable level of nectar concealment, or more complex evolutionary dynamics, with nectar concealment fluctuating within a bounded range.

B terrestris was always the most flower constant, followed by B lapidarius, with B pascuorum the least flower constant species. These interspecific differences in flower constancy were related to foraging performance under field conditions near Wurzburg, Germany in 1999 and 2001. B terrestris was more flower constant, and predominantly outperformed B lapidarius at collecting nectar in both years. As B terrestris is also the larger of these species, these data also support the idea that larger bees are more efficient at nectar foraging, i.e. they bring home more nectar per unit time. However B pascourum, the least flower constant of the three species tested, was the most efficient of them at collecting nectar, collecting 50% more nectar than B terrestris per hour. Therefore flower constancy appears to be a relatively poor predictor of species foraging performance, which is likely to be influenced simultaneously by many other factors including worker body size, tongue length, and foraging range.",,,,"Chittka, Lars/C-3110-2012","Chittka, Lars/0000-0001-8153-1732",,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8177,2363-7102,,,,,2005,28,2,,,,,81,89,,,,,,,,,WOS:000233528900001,,,,,

However, the effects of group size on individual aggression levels and the spatio-temporal aggression strategy of communal aggressors have not been fully explored. We therefore investigated how group size affects the aggression levels and the spatio-temporal attack strategy (which body parts, and the amount of time spent in attacking each part) in close combats between Trigona spinipes foragers and a natural competitor, Melipona rufiventris. In all trials, T spinipes foragers competitively excluded M rufiventris foragers from nearby feeders, exhibiting four levels of aggressive behavior ranging from threat displays to prolonged grappling and decapitation. Surprisingly, aggression levels and spatial strategy corresponded to the size of group attacks. Larger groups of attackers used individually lower aggression levels than small groups of attackers. Smaller groups also attacked appendages linked to escape (legs and wings) with greater frequency than larger groups, which focused on vital central body areas (abdomen, thorax, and head). Increased aggression corresponded to increased risks for attackers and the attacked. All combatants engaging at the highest level of aggression died (100% mortality).

Both European and Africanized bees varied significantly in their length of life, within a range of 19.9 to 25.9 days, but there was no clear and consistent difference for this trait between the two types of bees.

These results suggest that genetic effects influence the length of life of workers bees to a lesser degree than do environmental effects. The age at which bees began foraging affected both the length of life and the foraging life of the experimental workers. Bees that started to forage late in life lived longer than those that started early. Additionally, bees that initiated foraging activities at a younger age had a longer foraging life. The strongest correlation was between length of life and foraging life (p = 0.66), indicating that bees that lived longer also had a longer foraging life.

Behavioural and ecological data were collected from one nesting aggregation of the host bee on the island of Elba, Italy, from 1993 to 2003, and from a foraging site of the bee, ca 5 km from the nesting aggregation. Other Diptera associated with A. agilissmia at the field site were the bee fly Bombylius fimbriatus (Bombyliidae), the conopid fly Zodion cinereum (Conopidae), and the scuttle fly Megaselia andrenae (Phoridae). The phenology of the Diptera broadly overlapped with that of their host across the season of activity (end of April and all of May). Diurnal activity patterns differed slightly; L. personata in particular was active at the host's nesting site before A. agilissima. Female satellite flies also showed a range of behaviours in gaining entry to a host nest. We summarize published data on this and other Leucophora species that parasitize Andrena host bees. Host bees returning to their nests occasionally undertook zig-zag flight manoeuvres if followed by a satellite fly that were generally successful in evading the fly. Satellite flies that entered a nest, presumably to oviposit, were less likely to remain therein if another host bee entered the same nest, suggesting that one advantage to communal nesting for this host is a reduction in brood cell parasitism by L. personata. We provide the first clear evidence for parasitism by a Zodion of any Andrena host. Both L. personata and M. andrenae concentrated their parasitic activities in the zone of the host nesting aggregation with highest nest densities. Three of the Diptera, L. personata, B. fimbriatus, and Z. cinereum, seemed to have extremely low rates of parasitism whilst that of M. andrenae appeared low. Though they have refined parasitic behaviour that allows them to gain entry into host nests (L. personata, B. fimbriatus, and M. andrenae) or to parasitize adults (Z. cinercum), these parasites seem not to impact upon the dynamics of the host A. agilissima at the nesting aggregation, and the host possesses traits to reduce parasitism.",,,,"Polidori, Carlo/G-4382-2010; Paxton, Robert/D-7082-2015; GIOVANETTI, MANUELA/I-2629-2014","Polidori, Carlo/0000-0003-4834-0752; Paxton, Robert/0000-0003-2517-1351; GIOVANETTI, MANUELA/0000-0001-9442-0062",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-2933,1464-5262,,,,,2005,39,29,,,,,2745,2758,,10.1080/00222930500114210,,,,,,,WOS:000231150200004,,,,,

Seventy-four percent of visitor species accounted for only 11% of total visitor abundance and 69% were collected in three or fewer plant populations ( of ten). Of the few reliable visitors, Clarkia pollen specialist bees were the most frequent visitors, carried more Clarkia pollen compared to generalist foragers, and were less likely to harbor foreign pollen. Overall, the core group of pollinators was obscured by high numbers of incidental visitors that are unlikely to contribute to pollination. In a geographic context, the composition of specialist pollinator assemblages varied considerably along the abiotic gradient spanning the subspecies' range. However, the overall abundance of specialist pollinators in plant populations was not influenced by the broad-scale abiotic gradient but strongly affected by local plant community associations. C. x. xantiana populations sympatric with pollinator-sharing congeners were visited twice as often by specialists compared to populations occurring alone.

Workers were sampled along a 10 kin linear transect and 8-9 polymorphic microsatellite markers used to identify putative sisters. We provide the first published estimates of the number of colonies using a circle of radius 50 in in an agricultural landscape: 20.4 for R terrestris and 54.7 for R pascuorum. Estimates of nest density differed significantly between the two species: 13 km(-2) for B. terrestris and 193 km(-2) for B. pascuorum. Foraging ranges also differed substantially, with R pascuorum foraging over distances less than 312 in and R terrestris less than 625 m. Clearly bumblebee species differ greatly in fundamental aspects of their ecology. This has significant implications for the development of conservation strategies for rare bumblebees and isolated plant populations, for the management of bumblebees as pollinators, and for predicting patterns of gene flow from genetically modified plants.",,,,"Goulson, David/A-2462-2010","Goulson, David/0000-0003-4421-2876",,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,DEC,2004,107,3,,,,,471,478,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13510.x,,,,,,,WOS:000225266600003,,,,,

Both juveniles and adults are central place foragers that search for food at night and return to the same nest each morning. This study examines the homing abilities of juveniles of an undescribed species of gryllacridid from Western Australia. Juveniles were placed in a simple maze, which consisted of two chambers, one containing the nest and the other empty, linked by wide glass tubes to a central chamber containing food. The food was placed in this chamber with a consistent orientation relative to the exit tubes leading to the nest and empty chambers. Juveniles appeared to learn which chamber contained their nest and thereafter ignored the route towards the empty chamber. By exchanging the connecting glass tubes, it could be established that juvenile crickets were not using chemical trails to find their home. The positions of the empty and nest chambers with respect to the central chamber were exchanged and, in a separate manipulation, the spatial configuration of the food in the central chamber was also changed. Both manipulations resulted in a decrease in successful returns to the nest chamber, the former because the nest had been relocated, the latter presumably because the spatial arrangement of items within the food chamber now presented orientation cues, which led to the empty chamber. Furthermore, juveniles were able to estimate distance travelled, despite the absence of chemical or visual cues. Juvenile raspy crickets appear to be able to maintain nest fidelity from a very early age by using spatial landmarks and appear capable of measuring translational displacement intrinsically.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6962,,,,,DEC,2004,29,5,,,,,426,435,,10.1111/j.0307-6962.2004.00412.x,,,,,,,WOS:000225768000003,,,,,

Birds that had lost their nest to cane toads were less likely to be recaptured in subsequent years. Cane toads are having a significant negative effect at the population level: at present, rainbow bee-eaters produce 0.8 fledglings per nest. However, in the absence of cane toads each nest would produce 1.2 fledglings. Rainbow bee-eaters had little defence against the cane toads. The diurnal birds were not able to mob the nocturnal toads, nor were they able to eject cane toads from the nest. Deep nests and nests built on steep slopes were still preyed upon by the toads. Cane toads that were removed from the nest had the ability and motivation to return to the nest when displaced up to 1200 m away, suggesting that the nest is a valuable resource to toads. Cane toads were significantly more likely to: (a) prey upon nests containing hatchlings rather than eggs; (b) enter and occupy artificial nest tunnels (1.2 in deep) containing a small food item (20 g of raw chicken) rather than artificial nests that were empty. These results indicate that cane toads actively prey upon nests using olfactory cues. The predatory and homing abilities of cane toads are reviewed, as well as their need for diurnal shelter sites. The possibility that cane toads are having a negative impact upon other native, ground-dwelling vertebrate fauna via their role as opportunistic predators requires urgent investigation.

The species was pollinated by the giant honeybee (Apis dorsata) in a year of intensive community-level mass-flowering or general flowering (1996), but by several species of moths in a year of less-intensive general flowering (1998). We carried out paternity analysis based on six DNA microsatellite markers on a total of 277 mature trees forming four spatially distinct subpopulations in a 70 ha area, and 147 and 188 2-year-old seedlings originating from seeds produced in 1996 and 1998 (cohorts 96 and 98, respectively). Outcrossing rates (0.93 and 0.96 for cohorts 96 and 98, respectively) did not differ between years. Mean dispersal distances (222 and 192 m) were not significantly different between the 2 years but marginally more biased to long distance in 1996. The mean relatedness among cross-pollinated seedlings sharing the same mothers in cohort 96 was lower than that in cohort 98. This can be attributed to the two facts that the proportion of intersubpopulations pollen flow among cross-pollination events was marginally higher in cohort 96 (44%) than in cohort 98 (33%), and that mature trees within the same subpopulations are genetically more related to each other than those between different subpopulations. We conclude that D. tempehes maintained effective pollen dispersal in terms of outcrossing rate and pollen dispersal distance in spite of the large difference in foraging characteristics between two types of pollinators.

One gap in knowledge concerns the pattern and extent of pollinator movement among these sexually deceptive flowers and how this translates to pollen and gene flow. Our aim was to use mark and recapture techniques to investigate the behavior and movement of male Colletes cunicularius, an important bee pollinator of Ophrys. Our study site was located in northern Switzerland where a large population of the bees was nesting. Within two plots, (10x40 in), we marked bees with different colors and numbered tags. Seventeen percent of the 577 marked bees were recaptured over a period of 1 to a maximum of 11 days. However, the number of recaptures dropped dramatically after 3-5 days, suggesting an average lifetime of less than 10 days. Mark-recapture distances varied from 0 to 50 in, with a mean of 5 in. Our findings show that individual male bees patrol a specific and restricted region of the nesting area in search of mates. This mark-recapture study provides the first clues about the potential movement of pollen within populations of Ophrys orchids. We predict that orchid-pollen movements mediated by bees will be similar to the mark-recapture distances in this study.

Overall, flower choice patterns varied among bees, ranging from random selection to complete constancy. When flowers contained greater reward volumes and were spaced farther apart, bees showed less flower constancy and more moves to closely neighbouring flowers. Changes in reward concentration had no effect on flower constancy; however, more dilute rewards produced shorter flight times between flowers. In addition, there was a strong positive relationship between degree of flower constancy and net rate of energy gain when flowers were spaced farther apart, indicating that constant bees were more economic foragers than inconstant bees.

Among animals, stingless bees exhibit the unique behavior of depositing long substrate-borne odor trails that assist the orientation of flying nestmates to a specific three-dimensional food location. However, relatively little is known about the spatial structure of such odor trails, particularly vertical trails, and whether these trails are polarized to indicate the correct terminus. We show that a stingless bee, Trigona spinipes, can rapidly recruit nestmates in large bursts to a food source at a specific distance, direction, and height. In conjunction with a major recruitment burst, foragers deposited odor marks that attracted nestmates for up to 20 min. Surprisingly, these odor marks formed a short odor trail instead of a complete odor trail extending from the feeder to the nest (the classic description of a meliponine odor trail). The length of the odor trails varied between different feeder locations with different colonies, from a minimum of 3 m to a maximum of 29 m. The odor marks formed a polarized trail that newcomers followed to the end with the most concentrated odor marks (the feeder), even when the entire odor trail was rotated 180degrees and clean test feeders were set out at locations that foragers had never previously fed at. Thus locale odor or the potential communication of food location inside the nest do not account for the ability of newcomers to find the correct terminus.

When bees were allowed to actively touch a sucrose droplet with one antenna, contacts with the solution were frequent with durations of 10-20 ms and average intervals between contacts of approximately 40 ms. High sucrose concentrations led to short and frequent contacts. The proboscis response and M17 activity were largely independent of stimulus duration and temporal pattern. Taste hairs of the antennal tip displayed spike responses to sucrose concentrations down to at least 0.1%. The first 25 ms of the response were suitable for discrimination of sucrose concentrations. This time interval corresponds to the duration of naturally occurring gustatory stimuli. Sucrose responses between different hairs on the same antenna showed a high degree of variability, ranging from less than five to over 40 spikes per 0.5 s for a stimulus of 0.1% sucrose.

Eavesdropping has therefore acted as a selective pressure in the evolution of diverse animal communication systems, perhaps even in the evolution of functionally referential communication. Early work suggested that some species of stingless bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponini) may use interceptive olfactory eavesdropping to discover food sources being exploited by competitors, but it is not clear if any stingless bee can be attracted to the odour marks deposited by an interspecific competitor. We show that foragers of the aggressive meliponine bee, Trigona spinipes, can detect and orient towards odour marks deposited by a competitor, Melipona rufiventris, and then rapidly take over the food source, driving away or killing their competitors. When searching for food sources at new locations that they are not already exploiting, T. spinipes foragers strongly prefer M. rufiventris odour marks to odour marks deposited by their own nest-mates, whereas they prefer nest-mate odour marks over M. rufiventris odour marks at a location already occupied by T. spinipes nest-mates. Melipona rufiventris foragers flee from T. spinipes odour marks.

Tracking predatory insects presents a considerable challenge as they are often small, cryptic and highly mobile organisms. Using insect-borne pollen present either on the exoskeleton or within the gut, presents a useful technique by which the movements (spatial displacements) of insects can be determined, based on the distribution of flowering plants in the area, an appropriate pollen key or atlas, and an understanding of pollination ecology. Pollen has successfully been used to track the movement of bees and moths, but has rarely been used to track predatory insects. Since many predators are likely to encounter pollen as they forage on flowers, they are good candidates for this technique. In this review we examine two types of study that use pollen to track the movements of predatory insects: (a) those in which pollen from the surrounding landscape is used to assess habitat usage and short-term movement of generalist predators from a range of insect orders, and (b) those in which pollen from a known point-source is used to assess the movement and dispersal distance of the insects.

As previously shown M. seminigra is able to use visual flow to estimate flight distances. The present study investigated whether foraging bees encode the visually measured distance in their thorax vibrations. Bees were trained to collect food in flight tunnels lined with a black-and-white pattern on their side walls and floor, which substantially influenced the image motion they experienced. When the bees had collected inside the tunnels the temporal pattern of their vibrations differed significantly from the pattern after collecting in a natural environment. These changes, however, were not associated with the visual flow experienced inside the tunnel. Bees collecting in tunnels offering little visual flow (stripes parallel to flight direction) modified their vibrations similarly to bees collecting in tunnels with high image motion (cross stripes). A higher energy expenditure due to drastically reduced flight velocities inside the tunnel is suggested to be responsible for changes in the thorax vibrations.

The concentrations tested (20-70% sugar w/w) were within the biologically relevant range. They substantially influenced different parameters of the thorax vibrations. An increase of energy gains at the food source due to an increased sugar concentration was followed by an increase of both the pulse duration and the duty cycle and by a decrease of the pause duration between two subsequent pulses. These findings further support the hypothesis that the temporal pattern of the thorax vibrations reflects the energy budget of a foraging trip rather than food source distance.

Moreover, the location-specific recruitment of reactivated foragers, i.e., foragers that have previously experienced the same food source at a different location and time, has not been explicitly examined. However, such foragers may also play a significant role in colony foraging, particularly in small colonies. Here we report that reactivated Scaptotrigona mexicana foragers can recruit with high precision to a specific food location. The recruitment precision of reactivated foragers was evaluated by placing control feeders to the left and the right of the training feeder (direction-precision tests) and between the nest and the training feeder and beyond it (distance-precision tests). Reactivated foragers arrived at the correct location with high precision: 98.44% arrived at the training feeder in the direction trials (five-feeder fan-shaped array, accuracy of at least +/-6degrees of azimuth at 50 m from the nest), and 88.62% arrived at the training feeder in the distance trials (five-feeder linear array, accuracy of at least +/-5 m or +/-10% at 50 m from the nest).

(Apiaceae): Phenology, gene dispersal and reproductive success",ANNALS OF BOTANY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background and aims Eryngium alpinum (Apiaceae) is an endangered perennial, characteristic of the Alpine flora. Because the breeding system influences both demographic (reproductive success) and genetic (inbreeding depression. evolutionary potential) parameters that are crucial for population maintenance, the reproductive ecology of E. alpinum was investigated. Specifically, the aims of the study were (1) to determine the factors (resources and/or pollen) limiting plant fitness; and (2) to assess the potential for gene flow within a plant, within a patch of plants, and across a whole valley where the species is abundant. Methods Field experiments were performed at two sites in the Fournel valley, France, over three consecutive years. Studies included a phenological survey, observations of pollinators (visitation rates and flight distances), dispersal of a fluorescent powder used as a pollen analogue, the use of seed traps, determination of the pollen/ovule ratio. and an experiment to test whether seed production is limited by pollen and/or by resources. Key results E. alpinum is pollinated by generalist pollinators, visitation rates are very high and seed set is resource-rather than pollen-limited. The short flights of honeybees indicate a high potential for geitonogamy, and low pollen and seed dispersals suggest strong genetic structure over short distances. These results are interpreted in the light of previous molecular markers studies, which, in contrast, showed complete outcrossing and high genetic homogeneity. Conclusions. The study highlights the usefulness of adopting several complementary approaches to understanding the dynamic processes at work in natural populations. and the conservation implications for E. alpinum are emphasized. Although the studied populations do not seem threatened in the near future, long-term monitoring appears necessary to assess the impact of habitat fragmentation. Moreover, this study provides useful baseline data for future investigations in smaller and more isolated populations.

Theory predicts that the susceptibility of patches of plants to gene flow mediated by incoming pollinators will depend on the length of pollinator residence (the number of flowers visited during a bout in a patch). We sought to determine whether pollinator residence is sufficiently sensitive to patch size and separation to influence levels of gene flow significantly. We studied oilseed rape Brassica napus as an exemplar of a conventional animal-pollinated plant and as a species where there is a risk of genetic escape from genetically modified (GM) varieties. 2. We determined pollinator residence in 36 patches created by mowing an agricultural field of flowering oilseed rape. Each square patch had an edge length of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 m. Patches were separated by either 9 m or 18 m from the border of a large unmown area of crop. We used the residence of bumblebees (Bombus spp.) to solve a model of bumblebee-mediated gene flow. 3. Bumblebee residence increased significantly with patch area, but did not depend on the separation distance of the patch from the large areas of crop. Even in the largest patches, bees visited only c. 60 of the c. 1 x 10(5) flowers before leaving. 4. If bumblebees were the sole pollinators, the model predicted that 4-8% of the seed produced by the smaller patches (c. 80-320 plants) had fathers outside the patch, whereas in the larger patches (720-8000 plants) the prediction was 2-4%. Nevertheless, larger patches should produce the greatest number of seeds with extrinsic paternity. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our observations demonstrate that susceptibility to pollinator-mediated gene flow is liable to decrease systematically as the size of plant patches increases. These findings can inform the management of genetic diversity in and among small or fragmented populations. If the patch size-gene flow relationship that we observed applies to larger scales, the model could estimate gene flow between GM crops and volunteer or feral populations in agricultural landscapes.",,,,"Osborne, Juliet/I-6776-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,,,,,JUN,2004,41,3,,,,,539,546,,10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00912.x,,,,,,,WOS:000221507800011,,,,,

Invertebrate ichnofossils, preserving the most environmentally and climatically sensitive in situ behavior of Morrison organisms, are in nearly all outcrops. Terrestrial ichnofossils record biotic processes in soil formation, indicating soil moisture and water-table levels. Freshwater ichnofossils preserve evidence of water depth, salinity, and seasonality of water bodies. Ichnofossils, categorized as epiterraphilic, terraphilic, hygrophilic, and hydrophilic (new terms), reflect the moisture regime where they were constructed. The ichnofossils are vertically zoned with respect to physical, chemical, and biological factors in the environment that controlled their distribution and abundance, and are expressed as surficial, shallow, intermediate, and deep. The sedimentologic, stratigraphic, and geographic distribution of Morrison ichnofossils reflects the environmental and climatic variations across the basin through time. Marginal-marine, tidal to brackish-water ichnofossils are mainly restricted to the Windy Hill Member. Very large to small termite nests dominate the Salt Wash Member. Similar size ranges of ant nests dominate the Brushy Basin Member. Soil bee nests dominate in the Salt Wash, decreasing in abundance through the Brushy Basin. Deeper and larger insect nests indicate more seasonal distribution of precipitation and rainfall. Shallower and smaller insect nests indicate either dry or wet substrate conditions depending on the nest architecture and paleopedogenic and sedimentologic character of the substrate. Trace-fossil indicators of flowing or standing water conditions are dominant in the Tidwell Member and in fluvial sandstones of the Salt Wash and Brushy Basin Members. Large communities of perennial, freshwater bivalve traces are abundant in the Tidwell and Brushy Basin Members but to a lesser extent in the Salt Wash Member. Shallow crayfish burrows, indicating a water-table level close to the surface (< 1 m), are restricted to channel bank and proximal alluvial deposits in the Salt Wash, Recapture, and Brushy Basin Members. Sauropod, theropod, pterosaur, and other vertebrate tracks occur throughout the Morrison Formation associated with alluvial, lacustrine, and transitional-marine shoreline deposits. Ichnofossils and co-occurring paleosols in the Morrison reflect the local and regional paleohydrologic settings, which record the annual soil moisture budget and were largely controlled by the climate in the basin. Contributions to near-surface biologic systems by groundwater from distant sources were minor, except where the water table perennially, seasonally, or ephemerally intersected the ground-surface. The Jurassic Morrison Formation in the southern portion of the basin experienced a mosaic of seasonal climates that varied from a drier (Tidwell/Windy Hill deposition) to a wetter (lower and middle Salt Wash deposition) and slightly drier (upper Salt Wash deposition) tropical wet-dry climate, returning to a wetter tropical wet-dry climate near the end of Morrison deposition (Brushy Basin deposition). The northern part of the basin experienced similar trends across a mosaic of Mediterranean climate types. The range and mosaic pattern of wet-dry Morrison climates is analogous to the range of climates (and their seasonal variability) that dominates the African savanna today. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we determined the effect of caging and cold-anaesthesia on JH titers in both nurses and foragers. The JH titers of nurses and foragers kept in cages at room temperature, or anaesthetized on ice, for up to 24 hours were determined at various time intervals. Nurses displayed a significant and sustained increase in JH titers by 1-2 hours in 2 out of 3 colonies, regardless whether being cold-anaesthetized or caged. Nurses in 4 out of 4 colonies showed remarkable JH titer elevations 24 hours after being caged. The increase ranged from 3-142 fold compared to their initial baseline JH titers. In foragers, changes in JH titers depended on their initial JH titers: foragers with low JH titers increased while those with high JH titers decreased. These results suggest that nurses and foragers respond to stress differently.

In 65% of foraging groups, two to five members simultaneously exploited a single food source such as a stingless bee, termite, or ant nest; frequency of food-source sharing peaked at groups of four individuals. Within foraging groups, females spent more time climbing and searching; males did more hammering, pecking, and flaking. Grouping in this species is perhaps induced by cooperatively searching for and exploiting infrequent but highly profitable food sources.

Most animals have to bridge some distances in space and time to provide all resources necessary for survival. Little is known about how the local and regional management of tropical agroforestry systems, differing in the availability of food resources and suitable nesting sites, determine foraging trip duration and density of bees and wasps (Hymenoptera Aculeata). 2. In this study, foraging trip duration and brood-cell density (in trap nests exposed for a 15-month period) were analysed for three species, which represent three guilds in 24 agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia): the pollinator Heriades sp. aff. fulvescens (Apidae), the cacao caterpillar-hunting predator Rhynchium haemorrhoidale umeroatrum (Eumenidae) and the spider-hunting predator Auplopus levicarinatus (Pompilidae). The agroforestry systems were characterized by plant species richness, blossom cover of herbs, light intensity and distance from the nearest natural forest. 3. The correlation of foraging time to bee and wasp density showed the relative importance of food and nest-site availability for the pollinator and the spider-hunting predator, because both parameters are correlated with light intensity in the agroforestry systems. In contrast, foraging time and nest density of the eumenid predator were not correlated because of the distance between high quantities of food resources (in sites with dense cacao plants) and nesting sites (in adjacent natural forests). 4. The eumenid response to local and regional agroforestry management illustrates that species may survive only in landscapes that permit access to a multiple set of resources. Accordingly, habitat evaluations using only foraging time may lead to wrong conclusions, as key drivers of population dynamics may not be inside but outside the local systems, emphasizing the need for a landscape approach.",,,,"Tscharntke, Teja/N-5123-2014; Klein, Alexandra-Maria/J-5871-2016","Klein, Alexandra-Maria/0000-0003-2139-8575; Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf/0000-0003-1359-3944",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,,,,,MAY,2004,73,3,,,,,517,525,,10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00826.x,,,,,,,WOS:000220886800013,,,,,

Both feeders were the only food sources exploited by the colony during the assays since a flight chamber was used. After receiving nectar, hive bees performed processing cycles that involved several behaviors and concluded when they returned to the delivery area to receive a new food sample. During these cycles, receivers mainly performed oral contacts offering food, or inspected cells, and often both. In the latter case, both behaviors occurred simultaneously and at the same distance from the hive entrance. When they performed a single task, either the occurrence of cell inspections increased or contact offerings decreased for the highest reward rate offered to the donor-forager.

All honey bees showed a high degree of flower constancy to one colour and rarely visited the alternate colour, whereas most bumble bees indiscriminately visited both colours. Foraging rates (flowers visited per minute) and flower handling times did not differ between honey bee and bumble bee foragers; however, bumble bees tended to fly farther between consecutive flower visits and make fewer moves to nearest neighbouring flowers than honey bees. When bees were forced to specialize on one of two previously rewarding flower colours by depleting one colour of reward, honey bees required almost twice as many flower visits to specialize on the rewarding flower colour as bumble bees.

J,"Richardson, SC",,,,"Richardson, SC",,,Are nectar-robbers mutualists or antagonists?,OECOLOGIA,,,,,,,,,,,,"As ""exploiters"" of plant-pollinator mutualisms, nectar-robbers remove rewards (nectar) without providing pollination services. Though one might expect nectar-robbing to be costly to plants, it may instead benefit plants by indirectly increasing pollen dispersal. I investigated the direct effects of nectar-robbing bees (Xylocopa californica) on floral rewards and behaviors of pollinators visiting desert willow (Chilopsis linearis) and indirect effects of robbing on the reproductive success of the plant. Nectar-robbers reduced nectar; while unrobbed and robbed flowers were equally likely to contain nectar, nectar volumes were smaller in robbed flowers with nectar. Apis mellifera (honeybees), ineffective pollinators in terms of pollen deposition, avoided robbed flowers. In contrast, Bombus sonorus (bumblebees), effective pollinators, did not avoid robbed flowers. While bumblebees tended to spend less time in robbed flowers, the time that they spent in flowers was not correlated with pollen deposition. Using powder mimicking pollen, I found that on some days, powder was dispersed farther or to more flowers from robbed flowers, indicating that robbing may sometimes benefit plants by increasing male reproductive success. Powder movement suggested that the effect of robbing on male reproductive success ranged from costly to beneficial. The outcome for flowers that were marked early each morning was a function of prevalence of robbing and abundances of effective pollinators, but not a function of spatial variability among trees in prevalence of robbing or the abundance of ineffective honeybees. Unlike powder dispersal, female reproductive success, measured by fruit set and the number of pollen tubes growing in styles, was not affected by robbing. Thus, robbers did not reduce plants' female reproductive success either directly by damaging flowers or indirectly by reducing pollen deposition by pollinators.

The model combines the processes of pollen dispersal and pollination, resulting from wind and insect activity. It includes the effects of post-pollination reproductive processes by relating the number of progeny to both pollen deposition and competition at the stigma. Predictions compare well with a range of experimental results for different-sized GM source crops (i.e. 0.0064-0.8 ha) and non-GM target crops with different fertilities (i.e. self-fertile to 80% male-sterile). For these comparisons, we represent the variation caused by wind and insect exposure as a constrained set of random functions and limit the range of insect transport to typical plant-scale distances. In addition, the model is used to examine the relative sensitivity to the factors that determine gene flow. Target-crop fertility and source-crop size are shown to be more important than other factors, including background pollen and the natural range of insect activity.

We evaluated their nest-searching behaviour in different test situations to elucidate the nature of the visual marks they used in this task. When we modified or removed geometrical figures surrounding the nest, the bees searched for longer, showing that they noticed the introduced changes. However, these manipulations never prevented bees from finding their nest, suggesting that other visual cues were crucial in the task. Manipulations of the edges provided by the boundaries of the device (nest block, metal sheet on which the block was mounted) strongly impaired the homing performance. The further away the edges that were left intact, the stronger was the impairment of the homing behaviour. These results suggest that bees learn the distances of the various edges from the goal and that edges have a hierarchical significance according to their distance from the nest. The most distant edges provide vague information, which suffices to guide the insect towards the next edge in the sequence, until it recognizes the final, precise location of the nest. The results support the conclusion that information on distances is acquired using cues derived from motion parallax generated by the insect's self-motion. Recognition of edge parameters such as position and orientation might be achieved by an image-matching mechanism based on dynamic processes. Thus, in the homing task, there is no clear discrepancy between the eidetic and the parametric hypotheses of spatial representation. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Simonson and S.W. Hassler, document a range of tsunami deposits associated with impact fallout units whose impact connection is identified by associated microtektites and microkrystites (condensation spherules). The impact connection of these particles is demonstrated by iridium anomalies, unique platinum group elements patterns, and Ni-rich mineral phases. Densely packed tsunami-transported fragments and boulders overlie microkrystite units of the >2,629 +/- 5 Ma top Jeerinah Impact Layer (JIL). Tsunami events closely follow spherule settling associated with the 2,561 +/- 8 Ma Spherule Marker Bed SMB-1 and SMB-2 impact events, Bee Gorge Member, Wittenoom Formation. The two impact cycles are separated by a stratigraphically consistent silicified black siltstone, representing a ""Quiet Interval."" The SMB turbidites display turbulence eddies, climbing ripples, conglomerate pockets, slumps, and waterlogged sediment deformation features. Consequences of tsunami in the probably contemporaneous Carawine Dolomite (Pb-Pb carbonate ages of similar to2.56-2.54 Ga), eastern Hamersley Basin, include sub-autochthonous below-wave base excavation and megabrecciation of sea floor substrata, resulting in a unique 10-30-m-thick spherule-bearing megabreccia marker mapped over a nearly 100-km north-south strike distance in the east Hamersley Basin. The field relations suggest a pre-tsunami settling of the bulk of the spherules. Tsunami wave effects include: (1) dispersal of the spherule-rich soft upper sea floor sediments as a subaqueous mud cloud and (2) excavation of consolidated substrata below the soft sediment zone. Excavation and megabrecciation included injection of liquefied spherule-bearing microbreccia into dilated fractures in the disrupted underlying carbonates. Near-perfect preservation of the spherules within the basal microbreccia veins suggests tsunami-induced hydraulic pressures locally exceeded lithostatic pressure. Late-stage settling of spherule-bearing mud clouds in the wake of the tsunami is represented by an abundance of spherules in the uppermost microbreccia zones of the megabreccia pile. From the deep below-wave base facies of the Carawine Dolomite, tsunami wave amplitudes may have exceeded 200 m depth. The similar to2.47-2.50 Ga DGS4 (S4 Macroband, Dales Gorge Member, Brockman Iron Formation) fallout units include exotic chert and carbonate boulders transported by tsunami following settling of a 10-20-cm-thick microkrystite and microtektite-rich unit. Seismic perturbations preceding deposition of the JIL and SMB fallout units are marked by rip-up clasts. The geochemistry of microkrystites and microtektites suggests impact fallout originated from impacts in simatic/oceanic crustal regions, although tsunami waves may have originated from seismically reactivated faults and plate margins located at distance from the impact craters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1531-1074,,,,,SPR,2004,4,1,,,,,19,50,,10.1089/153110704773600212,,,,,,,WOS:000222461700003,15104901,,,,

The trial consisted of two identical strips (9 m X 45 m) along the forest ground-level discrete vegetation having herbaceous diversity. The design was a 'V', truncated in such a way that the zone, without any vegetation, between the two strips varied from 4.5 to 18 m in width. A nest of M. panamica colony was placed at 12 m from the top of the 'V'. Three equal sectors (135 m(2)) were identified in each strip. The bees were marked with different colours according to each sector of one strip, named the donor strip. Almost all bees were marked until their number was nearly balanced between the three sectors. Then, marked and unmarked bees were counted on the donor and recipient strips. Results showed that the foraging area in a given strip is about 405 m(2) and that a mean proportion of 3.45% of marked bees/total number of bees in colony was recovered in the recipient strip. It was found that a barren zone from 4.5 to 18 m in width was not sufficient to completely discourage bees from crossing between two identical resources, but that it significantly reduced cross-pollination. The bees dispersed pollens by bee-bee interactions within the nest, showing high diversity of pollens from outgoing bees, rather than incoming ones. The pollen viability study along the body of exiting bees showed that the pollens remained viable (48-51 %) within the bee nest, indicating a possibility of out-crossing by exiting bees at the time of their forage patch and trip change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0011-3891,,,,,Feb-25,2004,86,4,,,,,576,580,,,,,,,,,WOS:000221599600026,,,,,

Pollinators visiting large floral displays may probe several flowers in sequence, leading to geitonogamous (among-flower) self-pollination. To investigate the relationship between floral display size and patterns of pollinator movement, we studied foraging by several pollinator species in four replicate arrays of Mimulus ringens (Scrophulariaceae). In each array displays were trimmed to two, four, eight and 16 flowers per plant. 2. Bees preferred large displays, and probed more flowers in sequence on large than on small displays. However, the proportion of available flowers probed decreased with display, resulting in nearly equal floral visitation rates across treatments. 3. Because pollinators probed more flowers in sequence on large displays, plants with numerous flowers should experience more geitonogamous self-pollination than plants with small displays. 4. In all four treatments, pollinators frequently visited only one flower before leaving the plant. As the first flower probed on a plant cannot receive geitonogamous pollen, this potentially reduces selfing rates for those flowers, compared to flowers probed late in a long visitation sequence on a plant. Such differences among flowers in pollination history should increase variation in geitonogamous self-pollination among fruits within plants. 5. The three most abundant pollinator species differed significantly in behaviours that could influence plant mating patterns, including number of flowers probed per plant; interplant movement distances; and grooming. Variation in foraging patterns was also evident among individuals within species. These subtle differences in response should affect the pollination services provided to plants.",,,,"Mitchell, Randall J/G-6380-2010; Karron, Jeffrey/A-6855-2009","Mitchell, Randall J/0000-0001-7961-3560; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,,,,,FEB,2004,18,1,,,,,116,124,,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2004.00812.x,,,,,,,WOS:000188821200014,,,,,

Bees learnt to discriminate similar colours, but with smaller colour distances the frequency of errors increased. This indicates that pollen transfer might occur between flowers with similar colours, even if these colours are distinguishable. The effect of similar colours on reducing foraging accuracy of bees is evident for colour distances high above discrimination threshold, which explains previous field observations showing that bees do not exhibit complete flower constancy unless flower colour between species is distinct. Bees tested in spectrally different illumination conditions experienced a significant decrease in their ability to discriminate between similar colours. The extent to which this happens differs in different areas of colour space, which is consistent with a von Kries-type model of colour constancy. We find that it would be beneficial for plant species to have highly distinctive colour signals to overcome limitations on the bees performance in reliably judging differences between similar colours.

Insects such as bees and ants have evolved an accurate path integration system, assessing and coding rotations with the help of a general directional reference, the sun azimuth. In mammals, by contrast, this process can take place through purely idiothetic (mainly proprioceptive and vestibular) signals. However, without any stable external reference for measuring direction, path integration is highly affected by cumulative errors and thus has been considered so far as valid only for short-distance navigation. Here we show through two path integration experiments (homing and shortcut finding) that the blind mole rat assesses direction both through internal signals and by estimating its heading in relation to the earth's magnetic field. Further it is shown that the greater the circumvolution and length of the traveled path, the more the animal relies on the geomagnetic field. This path integration system strongly reduces the accumulation of errors due to inaccuracies in the estimation of rotations and thus allows the mole rat to navigate efficiently in darkness, without the help of any landmark, over both short and long distances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,,,,,Jan-27,2004,101,4,,,,,1105,1109,,10.1073/pnas.0307560100,,,,,,,WOS:000188533600037,14732687,,,,

Flies maintain a straight course and monitor their motion through the environment by sensing the patterns of optic flow induced in the eyes. Bees negotiate narrow gaps by balancing the speeds of the images in their two eyes, and they control flight speed by holding constant the average image velocity as seen with their two eyes. Bees achieve a smooth landing on a horizontal surface by holding the image velocity of the surface constant during approach, thus ensuring that flight speed is automatically close to zero at touchdown. Foraging bees estimate the distance that they have traveled to reach a food source by integrating the optic flow experienced en route; this integration gives them a visually driven ""odometer.""

We trained ants to forage at different distances in linear channels comprising a nest entrance and a feeder. For testing we caught ants at the feeder and released them in a parallel channel. The results show that ants tend to underestimate their distances travelled. This underestimation is the more pronounced, the larger the foraging distance gets. The quantitative relationship between training distance and the ant's estimate of this distance can be described by a logarithmic and an exponential model.

These insects remember no more than what is needed to sustain the separate and parallel strategies that they employ when travelling between their nest and foraging sites. One major strategy is path integration. The insect keeps a running tally of its distance and direction from the nest and so can always return home. This global path integration is enhanced by long-term memories of significant sites that insects store in terms of the coordinates (direction and distance) of these sites relative to the nest. With these memories insects can plan routes that are steered by path integration to such sites. Quite distinct from global path integration are memories associated with familiar routes. Route memories include stored views of landmarks along the route with, in some cases, local vectors linked to them. Local vectors by encoding the direction and/or distance from one landmark to the next, or from one landmark to a goal, help an insect keep to a defined route. We review experiments showing that although local vectors can be recalled by recognising landmarks, the global path integration system is independent of landmark information and that landmarks do not have positional coordinates associated with them. The major function of route landmarks is thus procedural, telling an insect what action to perform next, rather than its location relative to the nest. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In a laboratory experiment, we reared colonies of Forelius mccooki with pairs of Argentine ant colonies that either did or did not exhibit intraspecific aggression. F. mccooki reared with intraspecifically non-aggressive pairs of Argentine ants produced fewer eggs, foraged less actively, and supported fewer living workers than those reared with intraspecifically aggressive pairs. At natural contact zones between competing colonies of L. humile and F. mccooki, the introduction of experimental Argentine ant colonies that fought with conspecific field colonies caused L. humile to abandon baits in the presence of F. mccooki, whereas the introduction of colonies that did not fight with field colonies of Argentine ants resulted in L. humile retaining possession of baits. Additional evidence for the potential importance of colony- structure variation comes from the Argentine ant's native range.

In recent years the production of the Styrian oil pumpkin listed severe losses, one of the reasons is a decreased availability of pollinators. Since a great loss of bee colonies (decrease of about 200.000 beehives in the last ten years) and wild bees can be observed in Austria and worldwide, an adequate pollination cannot be guaranteed any longer. Strategies to find alternative pollinators and to ensure sufficient pollination are important. In this study we determined the pollination efficiency of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) compared to honeybees (Apis mellifera). Further we investigated the pollination behaviour (flower visit rate, visit frequency and forage distances) of bumblebees in the open field, to see if they can be used as an alternative, if honeybee colonies continue to decline, or honeybee pollination alone is not sufficient, for example at adverse weather. These studies of bumblebees in Cucurbita fields are the first ones in Austria, as up to now bumblebees were only used in glasshouses or orchards. Our studies showed that bumblebees can be used in the open field and can lead to a general improvement in pollination, as bumblebees visited four to five times more flowers in a minute and foraged at adverse weather, even during rain. But the use of commercial bumblebees in Styrian pumpkin fields, as already used in tomato or pepper greenhouses, can not be a solution for the pollination problems as at least four to five hives / hectare are needed.

We used experimental feeder arrays and provide the first detailed evidence demonstrating that recruitment communication in Melipona can lead to large, rapid and highly significant increases in the number of nestmates visiting a specific location. Melipona bicolor and M. mandacaia foragers both recruited nestmates to the correct distance and direction, but differed in their ability to recruit nestmates to the correct height. These differences may relate to their respective habitats. Melipona mandacaia inhabits semi-arid areas of Caatinga where most food sources occur close to the ground, and its foragers evidently cannot recruit nestmates to the correct height. Melipona bicolor, an Atlantic rainforest species, evidently does not communicate height when the food source is at ground level, but can communicate height when the food source is at the forest canopy level (12 m high), where major food sources occur. Species-specific variation in three-dimensional location communication is intriguing because it suggests that Melipona may be a good model for studying the evolution of recruitment communication systems in highly social bees.

The shape of an ant's route is set, initially, by navigational strategies, such as path integration and the ant's innate responses to landmarks, which depend minimally on memory. With increasing experience, these early routes are stabilised through the learning of views of landmarks and of associated actions. The substitution of memory-based strategies makes an insect's route more robust and precise. The ability to select between different learnt routes might incur additional memory requirements to those needed for performing a route, and lead to the associative grouping of those memories that relate to a particular route.",,,,"Graham, Paul/C-6420-2009","Graham, Paul/0000-0002-3745-0940",,,,,,,,,,,,0959-4388,,,,,DEC,2003,13,6,,,,,718,725,,10.1016/j.conb.2003.10.004,,,,,,,WOS:000187467100012,14662374,,,,

Experienced foragers and dance followers accounted for more than 93% of the shaking signals. Foraging success triggered shaking directly, during the next return to the hive, and indirectly, on the morning of the next day. Shaking occurred most often after the first foraging successes of the day and frequently following the first foraging success after a spell of bad weather. These findings confirm several hypotheses that predict that individual foraging success underlies colony-level patterns in shaking activity. Some results do not fit the previously suggested messages of the shaking signal. Therefore, I propose that the shaking signal has the very broad message: 'reassess your current activity'. This message can explain the wide range of contexts that trigger shaking while it acknowledges that the meaning of the signal depends entirely on the context of the recipient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0179-1613,,,,,DEC,2003,109,12,,,,,1009,1020,,10.1046/j.0179-1613.2003.00939.x,,,,,,,WOS:000187006200007,,,,,

In this study, I inferred the breeding system of the subterranean termite Reticulitermes flavipes based on colony and population genetic structure as determined from microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA markers. Termites were sampled from natural wood debris from three undisturbed, forested sites in central North Carolina. In each site, two transects separated by 1 km were sampled at approximately 15-m intervals. A total of 1272 workers collected from 57 collection points were genotyped at six microsatellite loci, and mitochondrial DNA haplotype was determined for a subset of these individuals using either restriction fragment length polymorphism or sequence variation in the AT-rich region. Colonies appeared to be localized: workers from the 57 collection points represented 56 genetically distinct colonies with only a single colony occupying two collection points located 15 m apart. Genetic analysis of family structure and comparisons of estimates of F-statistics (F-IT, F-IC, F-CT) and coefficients of relatedness (r) among nestmate workers with results of computer simulations of potential breeding systems suggested that 77% of all colonies were simple families headed by outbred monogamous pairs, whereas the remaining colonies were extended (inbred) families headed by low numbers of neotenics (about two females and one male) who were the direct offspring of the colony founders. There was no detectable isolation by distance among colonies along transects, suggesting that colony reproduction by budding is not common and that dispersal of reproductives during mating flights is not limited over this distance. Higher-level analysis of the microsatellite loci indicated weak but significant differentiation among sites (F-ST = 0.06), a distance of 16-38 km, and between transects within sites (F-ST = 0.06), a distance of I km. No significant differentiation at either the transect or site level was detected in the mitochondrial DNA sequence data. These results indicate that the study populations of R. flavipes have a breeding system characterized by monogamous pairs of outbred reproductives and relatively low levels of inbreeding because most colonies do not live long enough to produce neotenics, and those colonies that do generate neotenics contain an effectively small number of them.",,,,"Vargo, Edward/D-1097-2010","Vargo, Edward/0000-0002-8712-1248",,,,,,,,,,,,0014-3820,,,,,DEC,2003,57,12,,,,,2805,2818,,,,,,,,,WOS:000188061800012,14761059,,,,

Additionally, the numbers of the parasitoids Nomada lathburiana and Bombylius major were estimated. For calculations of the daily population size, the Jolly-Seber model for open populations with time-dependent survival and capture rates was used. The mean daily population size corresponded well to the number of nests marked in the aggregation of A. vaga. The method of mark-recapture achieved the most accurate data when the number of sampling periods and the capture probability was high. The results document a decrease in population size of the investigated A. vaga aggregation during 4 successive years. A population increase of its parasitoids B. major is considered to be one reason for the population decline of A. vaga in 1999. The sex ratio of A. vaga was biased toward females, contrary to the expected higher number of males. Results of the mark-recapture studies showed that up to 50% of females left the aggregation or died at the beginning of the season. The females probably colonized new aggregations at distances further than 200 m away from their birth aggregation, as no marked females were observed in the environs of the study area.

We therefore trained marked foragers of two species, Melipona mandacaia and M. bicolor, to feeders at different distances and to different sucrose concentrations at the same distance. In both species, foragers successfully recruited to a rich 2.5-m food source and produced pulsed recruitment sounds in which pulse duration was significantly and positively correlated with distance to the rich food source. When returning from poorer food sources (0.6-1.5 m), foragers of both species decreased sound production, producing shorter sound pulses and longer sound interpulses than they did for 2.5 m food located at the same distance. Thus the temporal structure of M. mandacaia and M. bicolor recruitment sounds varies with distance and food quality. However, nestmates were not recruited by performances for poorer food sources (0.6-1.5 m), whose sucrose concentration was sufficiently low to affect recruitment sounds. Surprisingly, the interphase (the time between behavioral phases that communicate location) also increases with decreasing food quality in the closely related honeybees (Apis), suggesting a potential homology in the effect of food quality on the recruitment systems of Apis and Melipona.

The system was simple, inexpensive (less than US $150 material costs), and recorded data could be easily downloaded and analysed. The array required a low amount of power (less than 0.6 W) and the detectors induced small levels of magnetic field (magnetic induction less than 5 muT DC and less than 1.5 muT at 576 kHz). To assist search coil design, an empirical equation for the inductance of relatively flat air-wound coils, based on magnetic field theory, was presented and fit to data taken from coils ranging from 8.75 to 40 mm in radius. Using search coils with radii of 8.75 and 15.5 mm in a continuous 6-day trial of the prototype device, presence of a 25 mg tag was correctly recorded 126 times, with a single false positive. However, interference between channels prevented more than three channels from being active at once, and temperature dependences of the detectors prevented them from being used outside of a relatively narrow temperature range estimated to be approximately +/-7degreesC about the temperature at which the detectors were tuned.

In contrast, we show that densities of bumblebees, an important pollinator group in agroecosystems, were not determined by the proportion of semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes. Instead, bumblebee densities were positively related to the availability of highly rewarding mass flowering crops (i.e. oilseed rape) in the landscape. In addition, mass flowering crops were only effective determinants of bumblebee densities when grown extensively at the landscape scale, but not at smaller local scales.

Grevillea macleayana is a rare, fire-dependent Australian shrub with large seeds lacking adaptations for dispersal; yet it produces inflorescences adapted to pollination by highly mobile vertebrates (eg birds). Interpreting fine-scale genetic structure in the light of these two processes is confounded by the recent imposition of anthropogenic disturbances with potentially contrasting genetic consequences: (1) the unusual foraging behaviour of exotic honeybees and 2. widespread disturbance of the soil-stored seedbank by road building and quarrying. To test for evidence of fine-scale genetic structure within G. macleayana populations and to test the prediction that such structure might be masked by disturbance of the seed bank, we sampled two sites in undisturbed habitat and compared their genetic structure with two sites that had been strongly affected by road building using a test for spatial autocorrelation of genotypes. High selfing levels inferred from genotypes at all four sites implies that pollen dispersal is limited. Consistent with this, we observed substantial spatial clustering of genes at 10 m or less in the two undisturbed populations and argue that this reflects the predicted effects of both high selfing levels and limited seed dispersal. In contrast, at the two sites disturbed by road building, spatial autocorrelation was weak. This suggests there has been mixing of the seed bank, counteracting the naturally low dispersal and elevated selfing due to honeybees. Pollination between near neighbours with reduced relatedness potentially has fitness consequences for G. macleayana in disturbed sites.",,,,"Whelan, Robert/E-3670-2010; Ayre, David J/A-8761-2008","Ayre, David J/0000-0002-3124-4417",,,,,,,,,,,,0018-067X,,,,,NOV,2003,91,5,,,,,475,480,,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800308,,,,,,,WOS:000186175600005,14576740,,,,

High numbers per nest and high nest densities can lead to the consumption of many kilograms of prey per hectare per year.

Its host plants include Koelreuteria paniculata, Sophora japonica, Ligustrum lucidum, Ligustrum vulgare, Oxydendrum arboreum, Catalpa speciosa, Lathyrus latlifolius, Lythrum salicaria, Buddleia spp., Vitex spp., and Asclepias spp. When foraging on L. latifolius and S. japonica, M. sculpturalis sometimes punctures the standard petal with its mandibles, leaving a distinctive mark that is useful for surveys. Over half of the host plants reported here originate from Asia, which is also the native range of M. sculpturalis.

Using microsatellite markers, we conducted a genetic analysis of space use and resource sharing at several spatial scales among workers of two ecologically dissimilar bumble bee species (Bombus terrestris and B. pascuorum) foraging in an urban landscape (London, UK). At fine scales, the relatedness of workers visiting small patches of flowers did not differ significantly from zero. Therefore, colonies shared flower patches randomly with other colonies, suggesting that worker scent-marks deterring visits to unrewarding flowers have not evolved as signals benefiting nestmates. To investigate space use at intermediate scales, we developed a program based on Thomas & Hill's maximum likelihood sibship reconstruction method to estimate the number of colonies utilizing single sites. The average number of colonies (95% confidence limits) sending workers to forage at sites of approximate to1 ha in area was 96 colonies (84-118) in B. terrestris and 66 colonies (61-76) in B. pascuorum. These values are surprisingly high and suggested that workers travelled far from their colonies to visit the sites. At the landscape scale, there was little or no genetic differentiation between sites. We conclude that urban habitats support large bumble bee populations and are potentially valuable in terms of bumble bee conservation. In addition, bumble bee-mediated gene flow in plants is likely to occur over large distances and plant-bumble bee conservation requires landscape-scale action.",,,,"Bourke, Andrew/E-5271-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,,,,,OCT,2003,12,10,,,,,2801,2808,,10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.01957.x,,,,,,,WOS:000185252400025,12969482,,,,

Correlated with sucrose responsiveness is forage choice behavior, age of first foraging, and conditioned learning response. Pheromones and hormones are significant components in social insect systems associated with the regulation of colony-level and individual foraging behavior. Bees were treated to different exposure regimes of queen and brood pheromones and their sucrose responsiveness measured. Bees reared with queen or brood pheromone were less responsive than controls. Our results suggest responsiveness to sucrose is a physiologically, neuronally mediated response. Orally administered octopamine significantly reduced sucrose response thresholds. Change in response to octopamine was on a time scale of minutes. The greatest separation between octopamine treated and control bees occurred 30 min after feeding. There was no significant sucrose response difference to doses ranging from 0.2 mug to 20 mug of octopamine. Topically applied methoprene significantly increased sucrose responsiveness. Handling method significantly affected sucrose responsiveness. Bees that were anesthetized by chilling or CO2 treatment were significantly more responsive than control bees 30 min after handling.

Oxygen consumption of active bees varied widely depending oil ambient temperature and level of activity, but did not differ between foragers (>18 d) and middle-aged hive bees (7-10 d). In highly active bees, which were in all endothermic state ready for flight, it decreased almost linearly, from a maximum of 131.4 mul O-2 min(-1) at 15 degreesC ambient temperature to 81.1 mul min(-1) at 25 degreesC, and reached a minimum of 29.9 mul min(-1) at 40 degreesC. In bees with low activity, it decreased from 89.3 mul O-2 min(-1) at 15 degreesC to 47.9 mul min(-1) at 25 degreesC and 14.7 mul min(-1) at 40 degreesC. Thermographic measurements of body temperature showed that with increasing activity, the bees invested more energy to regulate the thorax temperature at increasingly higher levels (38.8-41.2 degreesC in highly active bees) and were more accurate. Resting metabolism was determined in Young bees of 1-7 h age, which are not yet capable of endothermic heat production with their flight muscles. Their energy turnover increased from 0.21 mul O-2 min(-1) at 10 degreesC to 0.38 mul min(-1) at 15 degreesC, 1.12 mul min(-1) at 25 degreesC, and 3.03 mul min(-1) at 40 degreesC. At 15, 25 and 40 degreesC, this was 343, 73 and 10 times below the values of the highly active bees, respectively. The Q(10) value of the resting bees, however, was not constant but varied in a U-shaped manner with ambient temperature. It decreased from 4.24 in the temperature range 11-21 degreesC to 1.35 in the range 21-31 degreesC, and increased again to 2.49 in the range 30-40 degreesC. We conclude that attempts to describe the temperature dependence of the resting metabolism of honeybees by Q(10) values can lead to considerable errors if the measurements are performed at only two temperatures. An acceptable approximation can be derived by calculation of an interpolated Q(10) according to the exponential function V-O2 = 0.151 x 1.0784(Ta) (interpolated Q(10) = 2.12). (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We employed a negative incentive contrast procedure to examine whether a decrease of sucrose concentration in a regularly visited flower type affects bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) consummatory or choice behavior. Subjects were trained to enter a test arena where they foraged on a single, red, artificial flower that contained 140 mul of sucrose solution. Subjects were reinforced with a concentration of either 0.50 or 0.20 sucrose solution in 20 trials and in 12 subsequent test trials subjects were given a choice between a red and yellow flower that each contained 140 mul of 0.20 sucrose solution. Subjects that experienced a downshift of reward showed an abrupt disruption in consumption of sucrose solution from the red flower. These subjects were also significantly more likely to visit the novel yellow flower than subjects that were reinforced with 0.20 sucrose solution in red flowers in all trials. However, the effects of the downshift of reward were transient and appeared to disrupt consummatory behavior more strongly than flower preferences. These results support the idea that bumblebee foragers form expectations of reward in flowers-as is implied by the results of studies of honeybees-and suggest that unrealized expectations of reward may cause foragers to sample alternative flowers or to fly considerable distances in search of particular types of flowers.

The model may be applied to forage sources with various properties, and to colonies with different foraging-related parameters. In particular, we examine the effect of five foraging-related parameters on the foraging response and consequent nectar intake of a homogeneous colony. The parameters investigated affect different quantities critical to the foraging cycle-visit rate (affected by g), probability of dancing (m(pd) and b(pd)), duration of dancing (m(circ)), or probability of abandonment (A). We show that one parameter, A, affects nectar intake in a nonlinear way. Further, we show that colonies with a midrange value of any foraging parameter perform better than the average of colonies with high- and low-range values, when profitable sources are available. Together these observations suggest that a heterogeneous colony, in which a range of parameter values are present, may perform better than a homogeneous colony. We modify the model to represent heterogeneous colonies and use it to show that the most important effect of heterogeneous foraging behaviour within the colony is to reduce the variance in the average quantity of nectar collected by heterogeneous colonies.

In Experiment 1, the naturally occurring flights of allatectomized bees were tracked with radar to determine whether the deficit is physical or cognitive. The results indicated a physical impairment: allatectomized bees had a significantly slower ground speed than sham and untreated bees during orientation flights, but otherwise attributes such as flight range and area were normal. Flight impairment was confirmed in Experiment 2, based on observations of takeoff made in the field at the hive entrance. The allatectomized group had a significantly smaller percentage of flightworthy bees than did the sham and untreated groups. Experiment 3 confirmed the flight impairment in laboratory tests and showed that allatectomy causes a decrease in metabolic rate. Allatectomized bees had significantly lower metabolic rates than untreated and sham bees, while allatectomized bees receiving hormone replacement had intermediate values. These results indicate that allatectomy causes flight impairment, probably partly due to effects on metabolic rate.

The probability of bees performing waggle dances after a short travel distance correlates only with the low range of the green contrast of the pattern in the tunnel. But it does not correlate with the pattern's chromatic contrast or brightness contrast. Distance estimation is therefore colour blind. We also evaluated the waggle runs as a function of colour pattern. Their duration is the code for the food source distance.

On emergence, the young adult bees were marked and introduced into foster colonies housed in normal and observation hives and allowed to live out their lives. No obvious difference in within-hive behavior was noted between the temperature-treated bees and the foster-colony bees. However, when the temperature-treated bees became foragers and were trained to visit a feeder 200 m from the hive, they exhibited clear differences in dance performance that could be correlated with the temperatures at which they had been raised: bees raised at 32degreesC completed only approximate to20% of the dance circuits when compared with bees of the higher-temperature group. Also, the variance in the duration of the waggle phase is larger in 32degreesC-raised bees compared with 36degreesC-raised bees.

Ninety minutues after feeding, when gustatory responsiveness had increased in initially unresponsive bees, no changes in protein kinase A activity were found.

Feeding of adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate 8-bromo-sodium salt over 4 days increased gustatory responsiveness in newly emerged bees and adult foragers. These results enable us to distinguish between two different forms of gustatory responsiveness: basal and transient gustatory responsiveness.

Surprisingly, they often transfer to more than one receiver (published values range from 1.9 to 2.7). Several adaptive hypotheses have been proposed to explain why multiple transfer occurs. One hypothesis, information improvement, states that multiple transfer arises as an adaptive forager-driven process. Foragers use the delay in finding a receiver to assess the relative work capacities of foragers and receivers, performing recruitment dances when appropriate. Multiple transferring improves their delay information. We used a stochastic simulation model to investigate the non-adaptive partial loads hypothesis. We determined the extent to which partial crop loads and receiver filling and emptying rules (i.e. how much nectar to accept before leaving the transfer area) can cause multiple transfer. As many as 1.9 nectar transfers per returning forager were generated within biologically realistic parameter space. We suggest that much multiple transfer arises as a non-adaptive consequence of partitioning nectar foraging between foragers and receivers, but that this will also result in foragers having better information about the relative work capacities of foragers and receivers as a useful consequence. We suggest that the number of transfers caused by partial loads could also be increased by an adaptive forager-driven effort to improve their information concerning the balance of foragers and receivers and we outline a framework wherein the information improvement hypothesis can be directly tested.

They are considered useful for studies into the evolution of social behaviour since they exhibit the full range of social organisation from solitary to highly eusocial (sensu Michener, 1974; Wilson, 1971). Five genera are found in,Australia, namely Braunsapis, Exoneurella, Exoneura, Brevineura, and Inquilina. Sociality and life histories are well documented for the exoneurine genera (review in Schwarz et al., 1998) and Inquilina is an obligate social parasite of species of Exoneura (Michener, 1965). In this paper, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods using molecular sequence data from two mitochondrial gene regions (cyt b and COI) and a single nuclear gene region (EF-1alpha) are used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of the Australian allodapine genera. Results suggest that the exoneurine group (Brevineura, Exoneurella, and Exoneura + Inquilina) diverged very rapidly and are monophyletic to the exclusion of other (primarily African) allodapine genera. A clade containing Australian species of Braunsapis is also monophyletic to the exclusion of African congeners. Braunsapis is not phylogenetically close to, and is a more derived group than the exoneurine group and probably came to occupy the Australian plate via a later dispersal through the southern Asian region. It is unclear at this point how the exoneurine group came to occupy the Australian plate and possible scenarios are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Workers of ponerine ants licked fluid food during foraging and transported it as a droplet between their mandibles, whereas workers of species belonging to phylogenetically more advanced subfamilies, with a crop capable of storing liquids, sucked the fluid food, such as formicine ants of the genus Camponotus. In order to evaluate the performance of fluid collection during foraging, intake rates for sucrose solutions of different concentrations were measured in four ant species that differ in their foraging ecology. Scaling functions between fluid intake rates and ant size were first established for the polymorphic species, so as to compare ants of different size across species. Results showed that fluid intake rate depended, as expected and previously reported in the literature, on sugar concentration and the associated fluid viscosity. It also depended on both the species-specific feeding technique and the extent of specialization on foraging on liquid food. For similarly-sized ants, workers of two nectar-feeding ant species, Camponotus rufipes (Formicinae) and Pachycondyla villosa (Ponerinae), collected fluids with the highest intake rates, while workers of the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens (Myrmicinae) and a predatory ant from the Rhytidoponera impressa-complex (Ponerinae) did so with the lowest rate. Calculating the energy intake rates in mg sucrose per unit time, licking was shown to be a more advantageous technique at higher sugar concentrations than sucking, whereas sucking provided a higher energy intake rate at lower sugar concentrations.

We compared three structurally simple landscapes characterized by a high proportion of arable land and large patches, with three complex landscapes with a high proportion of semi-natural perennial habitats and low mean patch size. Four observation hives were placed in the centre of the landscapes and switched at regular intervals between the six landscapes from the beginning of May to the end of July. A total of 1137 bee dances were observed and decoded. Overall mean foraging distance was 1526.1 +/- 37.2 m, the median 1181.5 m and range 62.1-10 037.1 m. Mean foraging distances of all bees and foraging distances of nectar-collecting bees did not significantly differ between simple and complex landscapes, but varied between month and colonies. Foraging distances of pollen-collecting bees were significantly larger in simple (1743 +/- 95.6 m) than in complex landscapes (1543.4 +/- 71 m) and highest in June when resources were scarce. Dancing activity, i.e. the number of observed bee dances per unit time, was significantly higher in complex than in simple landscapes, presumably because of larger spatial and temporal variability of resource patches in complex landscapes.

The behaviour of both dancers and follower bees contain flexible and stereotypic elements. The transfer of specific information about direction and distance probably involves more than one sensory modality. The follower bees need to stay behind the dancer (within the angle of wagging) during at least one waggle run in order to perceive the specific information. Within this zone, a small stationary air-flow receiver (like the antenna of a follower bee) experiences a well-defined maximum when the abdomen of the wagging dancer passes by. Within 1 mm from the tip of the abdomen, the maximum may be caused by oscillating flows generated by the wagging motion. At other positions and distances (up to several millimetres from the dancer) the maximum is due to a spatially narrow jet air flow generated by the vibrating wings. The time pattern of these maxima is a function of the angular position of the receiver relative to the axis of the waggle run and thus a potential cue for direction. In addition to the narrow jet air flows, the dancers can generate a broad jet. The jets are not automatic by-products of wing vibration, since they can be switched on and off when the dancer adjusts the position of her wings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-7594,,,,,MAR,2003,189,3,,,,,165,174,,10.1007/s00359-003-0398-y,,,,,,,WOS:000182652100002,12664092,,,,

We then asked whether the reference position can be pinpointed from a random starting position by moving the panoramic imaging device in such a way that the image differences relative to the reference image are minimized. We find that on time scales of minutes to hours, outdoor locations are accurately defined by a clear, sharp minimum in a smooth three-dimensional (3D) volume of image differences (the 3D difference function). 3D difference functions depend on the spatial-frequency content of natural scenes and on the spatial layout of objects therein. They become steeper in the vicinity of dominant objects. Their shape and smoothness, however, are affected by changes in illumination and shadows. The difference functions generated by rotation are similar in shape to those generated by translation, but their plateau values are higher. Rotational difference functions change little with distance from the reference location. Simple gradient descent methods are surprisingly successful in recovering a goal location, even if faced with transient changes in illumination.

Previous studies of the Amazonian tree Dinizia excelsa (Fabaceae) found African honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata ) as the predominant pollinators of trees in highly disturbed habitats, transporting pollen up to 3.2 km between pasture trees. Here, using microsatellite genotypes of seed arrays, we compare outcrossing rates and pollen dispersal distances of (i) remnant D. excelsa in three large ranches, and (ii) a population in undisturbed forest in which African honeybees were absent. Self-fertilization was more frequent in the disturbed habitats (14%, n = 277 seeds from 12 mothers) than in undisturbed forest (10%, n = 295 seeds from 13 mothers). Pollen dispersal was extensive in all three ranches compared to undisturbed forest, however. Using a twogener analysis, we estimated a mean pollen dispersal distance of 1509 m in Colosso ranch, assuming an exponential dispersal function, and 212 m in undisturbed forest. The low effective density of D. excelsa in undisturbed forest (similar to0.1 trees/ha) indicates that large areas of rainforest must be preserved to maintain minimum viable populations.

They could orient towards the feeding place immediately after they rose in air from the nest without directly viewing the feeder. They could visit the feeding place after dark at a luminosity 8 lux. These data suggest that they can navigate for some distance with few external cues. Hornets also seem to rely on visual cues for their mid-range navigation. They used some structures on their way as navigational landmarks to negotiate. Individual hornets are supposed to have their own landmarks. Olfactory cues seem to be used to find a new feeding place or to recruit other member. In the approach flight hornets seemed to use multiple visual cues such as the visual characteristics of the feeder and the wider scenery around the feeder. Even if the feeder in training was removed during the test, they flew with a smooth course as if they were pin-pointing the missing feeder, but without sitting on the ground. Hornets learnt how to fly to reach the feeder without external cues after passing by the last visual landmark under conditions with extremely poor visual cues.

We studied here one unusual element of their behavioral repertoire: ambush predation. A worker of E. ruidum waits near a nest of a social sweat bee, Lasioglossum umbripenne, lunging at incoming bees, or less frequently, at departing bees. However, bees detected ambushing ants and modified their behavior. Dead ants placed at bees' nest entrances significantly decreased bee activity, indicating that bees recognized dead ants as potential predators. Neither simple black models (square and rectangle) nor olfactory cues had any effect on overall bee activity. A returning bee usually approached her entrance and immediately entered, but if an ant was waiting at the nest, a bee was significantly more likely to abort the first approach flight and then to re-approach the nest on the side opposite the ant's position. As models became increasingly ant-like, returning bees more frequently aborted their first approach flight, expressing other behaviors before entering nests. These behaviors included withdrawal followed by an approach from a different direction; zigzagging flights, either from a distance or close to the entrance or even a close inspection; landing a short distance from the nest, then approaching on foot or waiting for several seconds before entering. Ants responded with effective counter-behaviors.

To distinguish between adaptive and nonadaptive explanations for between-species differences in curvature, we determined the relationship between spur curvature and pollen removal, which is one estimate of male reproductive success. Spur curvature exhibited considerable variation both within and among three populations, with spur angles ranging from 0degrees to 297degrees. A greenhouse experiment determined that spur curvature of I. capensis flowers has a broad-sense heritability of 0.636. Laboratory experiments indicated that flowers having recurved spurs deposit significantly more pollen grains on hummingbird visitors than flowers having perpendicular spurs, apparently as a result of greater contact between the androecium of curve-spurred flowers and the upper bill of hummingbirds. We also found a significant relationship between spur curvature and flower length, suggesting a developmental link between the two traits.

Pollen movement has primarily been studied as a function of the direct relationships between plants and pollinators; however, nonpollinating floral visitors, such as some nectar robbers, may have indirect effects on pollen dispersal by altering plant-pollinator interactions. Theory predicts that nectar robbing should have indirect positive effects on plants by increasing pollen dispersal distance and reducing self-pollen transfer (geitonogamy) and inbreeding through changes in pollinator behavior associated with reduced nectar rewards. Here I experimentally tested the indirect effects of the nectar-robbing bumble bee, Bombus occidentalis, on the distance of pollen movement among plants and levels of pollen movement within plants (estimated using powdered fluorescent dyes as pollen analogues) using the self-incompatible, hummingbird-pollinated host, Ipomopsis aggregata. Empirical results did not fully support the theoretical predictions. Heavy levels of nectar (>80% of available flowers robbed) had no effect on the mean and mean-squared distance of dye dispersal within populations. However, hummingbird pollinators were 50% more likely to depart from a population after visiting a plant with low robbing relative to a plant With high robbing, suggesting that pollen dispersal among populations might be reduced in plants with high robbing relative to plants with low robbing. Heavy nectar robbing reduced levels of self-dye transfer by one-half. However, when I manipulated robbing levels and access to self-pollen, the costs associated with increased robbing and reduced pollinator visitation (e.g., reduced seed production) outweighed. any advantages associated with reduced geitonogamy. Taken together, these results suggest that the negative indirect effects of robbing on plant reproduction through decreased pollinator visitation and changes in pollinator departure from plants far exceed any positive effects associated with decreased geitonogamy. Given the widespread nature of plant attack by nectar robbers, these indirect effects are likely common phenomena structuring natural plant populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,FEB,2003,84,2,,,,,485,495,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0485:IONROE]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,WOS:000181482600021,,,,,

Birds allowed a 5-min preview of the surrounding landscape prior to release home faster than those denied access to such cues, suggesting that recognition is visually mediated. We examined this phenomenon further by asking how memory generated through prior experience with a site is used in recognition. We provided a group of homing pigeons with training experience in which they viewed, through a single transparent vertical face of an otherwise opaque release box, an approximately 140degrees segment of the landscape for 5 min before release. Training previews were always given from consistent locations and orientations within a release site. Test releases that followed were used to ascertain whether subsequent site recognition necessitated previewing from this already familiar angle and distance, or whether the skill could be extended to novel, nonoverlapping lateral views of the landscape. The results suggested that homing performance was better after presentation of the view recapitulating that seen during training than after showing a novel alternative view. Pigeons may have been using a template of the arrangement of familiar landmarks around the release site as the cue for recognition. The effect, however, disappeared after repeated training, suggesting that repeated release from a site may allow for more extensive visual survey and the memorization of detailed features of the landscape or the extraction of site-specific general features that aid recognition even when a novel view is presented.

Distance weakly affected pollen use; on average, bees nesting near a flower species tended to collect more of its pollen than did bees nesting at a greater distance. Flower density did not predictably impact pollen use, and use did not track changes in density during the season. Bees consistently mixed pollen from more distant. species, despite substantial added foraging costs, and also mixed when one species was an order of magnitude less abundant than the other. Bees require nectar as well as pollen to feed their offspring, and our preliminary data suggest that the efficiencies of pollen and nectar collection are inversely related between the two flower species, which would favor visitation to both species.

Key elements of the improvement are the use of buffering agents to stabilise medium pH and bottom-cooling of the cultures. Transformation was verified by PCR and Southern blot hybridisation. Transcription of transgenes was confirmed by RT-PCR and product sequencing.

Expression of various transgenes was detected in stem, leaf, seed, capsule and latex.

The speed at which the liquid is transferred (unloading rate) from donor to recipient is related to the profitability of the recently visited food source. Two main characteristics that define this profitability are the flow of solution delivered by the feeder and the time invested by the forager at the source (visit time). To investigate the effect of visit time on trophallactic behaviour, donor foragers were trained to a rate feeder that could deliver different flows of solution. We dissociated visit time and flow of solution by introducing pauses in the solution's deliverance at different moments of the foraging visit. We analysed whether timing of the non-deliverance period within the visit is important for the forager's assessment of resource profitability. During the subsequent trophallactic encounter with a hive mate, unloading rate was related to the total time invested by the forager at the food source only if the ingestion process had already been started. These results together with previous ones suggest that foragers integrate an overall flow rate of solution of the feeder throughout the entire foraging visit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-7594,,,,,JAN,2003,189,1,,,,,39,45,,10.1007/s00359-002-0373-z,,,,,,,WOS:000181117100004,12548428,,,,

Here we have sequenced and characterized a full-length cDNA encoding a putative iron-binding transferrin (AmTRF) in the honeybee. AmTRF shows high level of sequence identity with transferrins in both vertebrates and insects (26-46%) suggesting that the primary function of the predicted 712 amino acid protein is binding and transporting of iron. AmTRF is expressed ubiquitously, but particularly high levels of its mRNA are found in the central brain and in the compound eye. Using northern blotting and a microarray based approach we have examined the levels of AmTRF mRNA by expression profiling under a wide range of conditions including developmental stages, septic injury and juvenile hormone treatment. Increased expression of AmTRF is seen during early pupal stages, in the brain of mature foragers and in the abdomen of virgin queens, whereas treatment with juvenile hormone leads to a decrease of AmTRF levels in the abdomen. We show that a transcriptional response of transferrin to septic injury with E. coli is relatively moderate as compared to a dramatic up-regulation of an antibacterial polypeptide, Hymenoptaecin, under similar conditions. We conclude that major fluctuations of AmTRF mRNA in time and space are consistent with context-dependent functional significance and suggest broader multifunctional roles for transferrin in insects.",,,,"Maleszka, Ryszard/A-6078-2008","Maleszka, Ryszard/0000-0003-1855-555X; Kucharski, Robert/0000-0002-1708-1877",,,,,,,,,,,,1536-2442,2250-2645,,,,,2003,3,,,,,,,,27,10.1093/jis/3.1.27,,,,,,,WOS:000209710100027,15841243,,,,

I used foraging tests and feeding trials to compare the ability of a generalist and a specialist solitary mason bee species to collect and develop on two pollen species that are not normally used in natural populations (novel pollens). Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) is a generalist pollen feeder; O. californica, is more specialized. Adults of the specialist were more limited in use of novel hosts, but only in some contexts. Both bee species refused to collect one novel pollen. The specialist accepted a second novel pollen only when it was presented along with its normal pollen, whereas the generalist collected novel pollen whether presented alone or with normal pollen. Surprisingly, larvae of the specialist were more flexible than were generalists. The specialist grew well on mixtures of normal and novel pollen species, in some cases better than on its normal host alone. Larvae of the generalist grew more poorly on all diets containing novel pollens than on their normal host. Data on these two species of bees suggest that specialization by itself need not reduce flexibility on novel hosts. The findings also provide information about mechanisms of specialization in bees. Similar to some folivores, specific cues of the pollen host and the bee's interpretation of these contribute, along with foraging economics, to pollen choice by adults. The ability of the larvae, to cope with specific components of one pollen species need not interfere with its ability to use others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,JAN,2003,134,2,,,,,228,237,,10.1007/s00442-002-1104-4,,,,,,,WOS:000180822900009,12647164,,,,

Since pollinator choice behavior is guided by how the pollinator perceives and evaluates floral rewards, we hypothesize that plants have evolved strategies that maximize their perceived profitability, through pollinator cognition-mediated coevolution. We focus on two classes of cognitive phenomena, context-dependent evaluations and risk-sensitivity. These phenomena are of interest to psychologists and biologists. Our paper is an attempt to show the value of cross-disciplinary exchange of theories and ideas. A review of the ecology literature suggests that pollinators evaluate variability in nectar volume in proportion to the mean, and thus choice behavior is guided by the coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean) of the distribution. This functional relationship is predicted by Weber's law, which describes a wide range of psychophysical phenomena. Simulations show that this phenomenon also affects how pollinators perceive skewed nectar distributions. Cognition-mediated coevolution theory should be a fruitful approach to understanding the evolution of pollinator-plant interactions.",,,,"Shafir, Sharoni/D-9821-2011","Shafir, Sharoni/0000-0002-9068-1078",,,,,,,,,,,,0378-2697,,,,,,2003,238,1-Apr,,,,,195,209,,10.1007/s00606-003-0280-y,,,,,,,WOS:000183449500017,,,,,

This plant inhabits the high altitudinal sub-alpine zone, which is characterized by a harsh climate, low species diversity and a short growing season. Echium wildpretii is a monocarpic perennial, producing a 2-3 m column-shaped, red-flowered, nectar-rich inflorescence. Although these floral traits have previously been suggested as being typical of ornithophilous flowers, this is the first study reporting observations of native birds (Phylloscopus collybita and Serinus canarius) in addition to insects visiting the flowers for nectar. The purposes of this study were firstly to, investigate levels of visitation by native birds, native insects, and introduced honey bees. Secondly, we studied the influence of floral display (plant height and number of flowers), nearest neighbours (distance and size) and local vegetation structure on visitation rate. Finally, we discuss the evolution of ornithophily in an otherwise entomophilous plant lineage. We found that the level of bird visitation was relatively high early in the flowering season, but decreased in mid/late season, while the opposite pattern was found for introduced honey bees. For native insects, the frequency of visits was similar in early and late season. Bird visits were correlated with floral display. In the early season, visitation rates of honey bees and the two most common native bee species were correlated with size of the plant or its nearest neighbours, consistent with preference patterns for larger resource patches. Since only insects visit the flowers of other species in the Echium clade, E. wildpretii appears to have evolved from a truly insect-pollinated lineage.

(Labiatae),EVOLUTION,,,,,,,,,,,,"I address how floral complexity influences geitonogamous self-pollination through manipulation of pollinator behavior in Salvia nipponica. The pivoting stamens of S. nipponica hinder nectar-collecting bumblebees from crawling into flowers, increasing the probing time per flower. I predicted that longer probing times would reduce the relative cost of moving between plants, causing bees to leave plants earlier. To test this prediction, I simplified S. nipponica flowers by removing the stamens from all open flowers within a 75-m(2) quadrat. Bumblebees probed these flowers more quickly than intact flowers, but the stamen removal affected neither the frequency of flower revisitation nor the flight distance between plants. In response to the decrease in the probing time per flower, bees probed more flowers on these plants. Therefore, in S. nipponica, floral complexity reduces the opportunity for geitonogamous self-pollination. Stamen removal also increased bee visitation per flower, suggesting that this sort of complexity deters visitation. To keep complex flowers attractive, therefore, selection might increase floral rewards or longevity. Floral complexity might evolve in an integrative manner with the rest of the floral phenotype.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0014-3820,1558-5646,,,,DEC,2002,56,12,,,,,2414,2423,,,,,,,,,WOS:000180503700008,12583582,,,,

Sci. 77, 138-145). We describe a detailed experimental and mathematical analysis of information exchange and decision-making in, arguably, the most difficult collective choices that social insects face: namely, house hunting by complete societies. The key issue is how can a complete colony select the single best nest-site among several alternatives? Individual scouts respond to the diverse information they have personally obtained about the quality of a potential nest-site by producing a recruitment signal. The colony then deliberates over (i.e. integrates) different incoming recruitment signals associated with different potential nest-sites to achieve a well-informed collective decision. We compare this process in honeybees and in the ant Leptothorax albipennis. Notwithstanding many differences-for example, honeybee colonies have 100 times more individuals than L. albipennis colonies-there are certain similarities in the fundamental algorithms these societies appear to employ when they are house hunting. Scout honeybees use the full power of the waggle dance to inform their nest-mates about the distance and direction of a potential nest-site (and they indicate the quality of a nest-site indirectly through the vigour of their dance), and yet individual bees perhaps only rarely make direct comparisons of such sites. By contrast, scouts from L. albipennis colonies often compare nest-sites, but they cannot directly inform one another of their estimation of the quality of a potential site. Instead, they discriminate between sites by initiating recruitment sooner to better ones. Nevertheless, both species do make use of forms of opinion polling. For example, scout bees that have formerly danced for a certain site cease such advertising and monitor the dances of others at random. That is, they act without prejudice. They neither favour nor disdain dancers that advocate the site they had formerly advertised or the alternatives. Thus, in general the bees are less well informed than they would be if they systematically monitored dances for alternative sites rather than spending their time reprocessing information they already have. However, as a result of their lack of prejudice, less time overall will be wasted in endless debate among stubborn and potentially biased bees. Among the ants, the opinions of nest-mates are also pooled effectively when scouts use a threshold population of their nest-mates present in a new nest-site as a cue to switch to more rapid recruitment. Furthermore, the ants' reluctance to begin recruiting to poor nest-sites means that more time is available for the discovery and direct comparison of alternatives. Likewise, the retirement of honeybee scouts from dancing for a given site allows more time for other scouts to find potentially better sites. Thus, both the ants and the bees have time-lags built into their decision-making systems that should facilitate a compromise between thorough surveys for good nest-sites and relatively rapid decisions. We have also been able to show that classical mathematical models can illuminate the processes by which colonies are able to achieve decisions that are relatively swift and very well informed.",,,,"Britton, Nicholas F/B-3413-2014; Mallon, Eamonn/H-1834-2011; Pratt, Stephen/C-5418-2011; Franks, Nigel/AAG-8207-2019","Britton, Nicholas F/0000-0002-1422-6487; Mallon, Eamonn/0000-0002-4198-4611; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8436,1471-2970,,,,Nov-29,2002,357,1427,,,,,1567,1583,,10.1098/rstb.2002.1066,,,,,,,WOS:000179580100007,12495514,,,,

For example, when offered a choice of a constant feeding option that always offers three seeds, and a risky option that offers either no seeds or six seeds with equal probability, most animals tested will be either risk-averse or risk-prone, preferring either the fixed or variable option respectively. Whether animals are risk-averse or risk-prone appears to depend on a range of factors, including the energetic status of the forager, the type of variance associated with the feeding options and even the number of feeding options between which the animal is choosing. These behavioural phenomena have attracted much. theoretical interest, and a range of different explanations have been suggested, some based on a consideration of the psychological mechanisms involved in decision making, and others on a consideration of the Darwinian fitness consequences of risk-averse or risk-prone behaviour for the forager: A brief review of the recent literature on risk-sensitive foraging will be presented, focusing on results from the two experimental systems with which I have been involved: wild rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) foraging on artificial flowers; European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) foraging in operant boxes in the laboratory.

For colonies foraging at natural sources, the direction information sometimes increases food collected, but at other times it makes no difference. The food-location information in the dance is presumably important when food sources are hard to find, variable in richness and ephemeral. Recruitment based simply on arousal of foragers and communication of floral odour, as occurs in honeybees(1), bumble bees(11) and some stingless bees(12), can be equally effective under other circumstances.

New fossil data, comprehensive information on Mesozoic and Cenozoic coastline positions and the availability of phylogenetically informative DNA markers now makes it feasible to test these hypotheses for some groups of bees. This paper presents historical biogeographical analyses of the genus Xylocopa Latreille, based on phylogenetic analyses of species belonging to 22 subgenera using molecular data from two nuclear genes, elongation factor-1alpha (EF-1alpha) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), combined with previously published morphological and mitochondrial data sets. Phylogenetic analyses based on parsimony and likelihood approaches resulted in several groups of subgenera supported by high bootstrap values (>85%): an American group with the Oriental/Palaearctic subgenera Nyctomelitta and Proxylocopa as sister taxa; a geographically diverse group (Xylocopa s.l); and a group consisting of African and Oriental subgenera. The relationships among these three clades and the subgenus Perixylocopa remained unresolved. The Oriental subgenus Biluna was found to be the sister group of all other carpenter bee subgenera included in this study. Using a relaxed molecular clock calibrated using fossil carpenter bees, we show that the major splits in the carpenter bee phylogeny occurred well after the final breakup of Gondwanaland (the separation of South America and Africa, 100 Mya), but before important Miocene fusion events. Ancestral area analysis showed that the genus Xylocopa most likely had an Oriental-Palaearctic origin and that the present world distribution of Xylocopa subgenera resulted mainly from independent dispersal events.

We document various factors that influence this decision: (1) learning flights reappear when experienced bees encounter a delay in finding food at a familiar place and the durations of such ""reorientation flights"" increase with the length of the delay; (2) the decay in learning flight duration over visits following such reorientation flights is more rapid than following initial discovery of the food; (3) learning flight duration increases with the visual complexity of the scene surrounding the food, and when spatial relationships among landmarks are unstable; and (4) durations of learning flights at a new feeding place are influenced by the sucrose concentration in the food.

Our samples encompass a large proportion of the species' range; three samples are from Arizona, one from Utah, two from northern Canada, one from Mount Washington (the highest point in the eastern United States), and one from Sweden. Most samples had high levels of genetic variation compared with other bees, but the one from Sweden had low heterozygosity, suggesting that this location may have been comparatively recently colonized. The three northern North American samples were genetically similar despite the large geographic distances separating the localities (average >3000 km). In contrast, the southern United States samples were (with the exception of one pairwise estimate) genetically divergent despite the small geographic distances separating them (average <500 km). These results are consistent with earlier divergence among the southern populations, which are currently separated by regions of low elevation and inhospitable desert, than among the more northern ones. Although the data are not conclusive, they are suggestive of northward dispersal from refugia south of the ice sheets since the last glaciation.",,,,,"packer, laurence/0000-0002-1711-8203",,,,,,,,,,,,0008-347X,,,,,SEP-OCT,2002,134,5,,,,,619,631,,10.4039/Ent134619-5,,,,,,,WOS:000178542400004,,,,,

Habitat requirements of solitary bees include nesting sites, food resources and nesting material. We used translocation experiments to establish foraging distances and measured foraging trip duration to analyse how solitary bees cope with the distance between nesting sites and suitable food plants in different habitat types. 2. Maximum foraging distance between nesting site and food patch was 150-600 m for the 16 bee species examined. Foraging distance was correlated positively with body length. Mean foraging trip duration, measured for seven bee species, ranged from 6 to 28 min and was also correlated with body length. In a study of the polylectic species Osmia rufa, we found a significant decrease in foraging trip duration with increasing number of plant species. Logistic regressions showed that the oligolectic Megachile lapponica nested in trap nests with a probability of 50% if the distance between trap nest and food patch was less than 250 m. The oligolectic Chelostoma rapunculi utilized trap nests when the distance to the nearest food patch was less than 300 m. 3. These experiments showed that solitary bees have a rather small foraging range so local habitat structure appears to be of more importance than large-scale landscape structure. All requirements for sustaining viable populations must be within this range. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain and restore a dense network of habitat patches in landscapes to ensure long-term sustainability of wild bee diversity and their ecological function as pollinators.",,,,"Tscharntke, Teja/N-5123-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,,,,,SEP,2002,71,5,,,,,757,764,,10.1046/j.1365-2656.2002.00641.x,,,,,,,WOS:000178187900004,,,,,

The model requires specification of three elements: (1) the paternity that originates from a single flower, the paternity shadow; (2) the mean number of flowers that pollinators visit during stays in the sink population, the residence; (3) the proportion of pollinators arriving at the sink that carry pollen from the source population. Provided that pollinators visit enough flowers in the sink to exhaust the paternity shadows from the source, the general results are that gene flow is inversely proportional to the mean pollinator residence in the sink population, and is proportional to the fraction of pollinators arriving with pollen from the source. These results are used to propose explanations for two of the widely observed patterns in gene flow among plant populations. Numerical solutions to the model are derived using experimentally determined values of elements (1) and (2) that represent bumblebees, Bombus spp., visiting agricultural fields of oilseed rape, Brassica napus L. In B. napus, the paternity shadow attenuates rapidly over approximately 20 recipient flowers. Mean bumblebee residences in the fields studied varied between 490 and 720 flowers. In the absence of a direct measurement of element (3), we calculated the maximum level of bumblebee-mediated gene flow by assuming that all bees arrived at the sink saturated with pollen from extrinsic sources. In this case, the model predicts that bumblebee-mediated gene flow accounted for between 0.1% and 0.5% of the progeny in the agricultural fields studied. A likelihood analysis Of Our observations is unable to reveal convincingly the proportion of bees arriving at the sink via a source population, but the literature suggests that bumblebees have high site fidelity, which implies that bee-mediated gene flow may be substantially less than our estimated maximum.

Bagging of the flower buds without natural (pollination by insects) or hand-pollination yielded almost no fruit or seed, suggesting that the species are obligately insect pollinated. Self-pollination led to a significant reduction in seed number per fruit and increased seed abortion compared with cross-pollination. Moreover, seed number increased with increasing distance between the pollen donor and pollen recipient. Flight distances of bumblebees were estimated for bilberry by monitoring between-flower and, for lingonberry, between-inflorescence flight distances. About 90% of all flights were at distances of less than 1 m. At this distance, we observed less than the maximum seed number per fruit in hand-pollinations in both study species.

Until recently it was not possible to apply this very powerful technique to Study the behaviour of insects flying close to the ground because the strong radar echoes, reflected from ground features and from vegetation ('clutter'), almost always mask the very weak signals returned from insects. This constraint has been overcome, at least for insects weighing more than approximate to 50 mg, by the development of an harmonic radar, and of transponder tags small enough to be carried by these insects without impeding their flight performance. Because the transponders have to be carried by insects in flight, extreme miniaturisation was obviously essential and it was achieved by using a passive, frequency-doubling technique, so that no on-board battery was needed. Transponders with all-up weights of between I and 12 mg were produced. the weights varying according to the degree of mechanical robustness required. The frequency-doubled signals from the transponder are selectively detected by the radar so that the tagged insects can be located even in the presence of very strong clutter. The system has three major advantages over conventional visual and video methods of observing low-flying insects. Firstly, and most importantly, its range of operation (LIP to 900 m) allows surveillance and flight tracking over hundreds of thousands of 1112, i.e. four orders of magnitude greater than is possible with conventional methods. Secondly, it provides dynamic and geometrically correct records of the insects' horizontal flight paths and thirdly, it works equally well by day and night. The technique has introduced a new era in the study of insect flight at low altitude. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This variability has not been adequately explained. In many social insects, size variation is adaptive, with different-sized workers performing different tasks (alloethism). Here we established whether workers of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera; Apidae), exhibit alloethism. We quantified the size of workers engaging in foraging compared to those that remain in the nest, and confirmed that it is the larger bees that tend to forage ((X) over bar +/- SE thorax widths 4.34 +/- 0.01 mm for nest bees and 4.93 +/- 0.02 mm for foragers). We then investigated whether large bees are better suited to foraging because they. are able to transport heavier loads of food back to the nest. Both pollen and nectar loads of returning foragers were measured, demonstrating that larger bees do return with a heavier mass of forage. Foraging trip times were inversely related to bee size when collecting nectar, but were unrelated to bee size for bees collecting pollen. Overall, large bees brought back more nectar per unit time than. small bees, but the rate of pollen collection appeared, to be unrelated to size. The smallest foragers had a nectar foraging rate close to zero, presumably explaining why foragers tend to be large. Why might larger bees be better at foraging? Various explanations are considered: larger bees are able to forage in, cooler conditions, may he able to forage over larger distances, and are perhaps also less vulnerable to predation. Conversely, small workers are presumably cheaper to produce and may be more nimble at within-nest tasks. Further research is needed to assess these,possibilities.

Recent work on ants and bees has uncovered a major role for associative links between long-term memories. We emphasize the roles of these associations in the reliable recognition of visual landmarks and the reliable performance of learnt routes.

This behavior suggested that the path integration system had been reset to a state corresponding to an outward flight to the food. Most models of insect navigation assume that it is the experience of reaching home that resets the path integration system, enabling the activation of vectors appropriate for subsequent outbound foraging trips.

Concurrently, the importance of the natural dispersal of bacteria as a complicating factor was assessed. Tests were performed under two sets of conditions, those that allowed for the dispersal of bacteria via honeybee activity and those that minimized it through the use of translucent polyethylene enclosures around single trees. The enclosures also raised daytime temperatures and allowed for controlled wetting, two factors important to the development of blossom blight. Single-antagonist treatments with strain E325, Pseudomonas fluorescens strain A506, and R agglomerans strain C9-1 were applied to open blossoms on each of 10 enclosed trees and 10 nonenclosed trees. During bloom, suspensions of antagonists (10(8) CFU/ml) were applied twice with a brush, and a suspension of Erwinia amylovora (10(7) CFU/ml) was subsequently applied once using the same method. Two days after inoculation with the pathogen, trees were misted to simulate precipitation. Flower-to-flower spread of antagonistic bacteria was less frequent on trees surrounded by plastic enclosures than on nonenclosed trees. The range and statistical separation of means for population size of E. amylovora and disease incidence among treatments were greater for enclosed trees than for nonenclosed trees. Based on these results, the natural spread of antagonists being compared may mask differences in their efficacy as biocontrol agents. Such distortions and resulting misinterpretations could be lessened by separating treatments widely in large orchard blocks and by monitoring microbial populations.

(2) Solitary wild bees, bumble bees, and honey bees respond to landscape context at different spatial scales, We selected 15 landscape sectors and determined the percentage of seminatural habitats and the diversity of habitat types at eight spatial scales (radius 250-3000 m) by field inspections and analyses of vegetation maps using two Geographic Information Systems.

(Lamiaceae) in experimentally fragmented calcareous grasslands and corresponding control plots at two study sites (Movelier and Nenzlingen) in the north-western Swiss Jura mountains. Fragments (1.5 x 1.5 m) were isolated by a 5-m wide strip of frequently mown vegetation while the control plots were situated in the adjacent undisturbed vegetation. The most common pollinator, the bumblebee Bombus veteranus (Apidae), visited fragments 53.7% less frequently than control plots. Furthermore, a change in foraging behaviour of Bombus veteranus was observed. In fragments the bumblebees visited more inflorescences, flew longer total visiting distances and the visiting time per patch tended to be higher than in control plots. The distribution of angles between arrival and departure direction (turning angles) differed from a uniform distribution in fragments but not in control plots. The increased directionality of bumblebee flight might be due to a decrease in floral rewards. Our results show that small-scale habitat fragmentation can affect plant pollination at two levels both relevant for plant fitness. First, lower visitation rates indicate a limitation of pollinators which might result in reduced seed set of the pollinated plant.

The speed of motion and the spatial period of the gratings and the height of the walls could be varied independently on the left-hand and right-hand sides of the channel. The results clearly show that the ants, while exhibiting their centring responses, try to balance neither the self-induced image speeds nor the contrast frequencies seen in their left and right visual fields, but the vertical angle subtended by the landmarks on either side.

These species were chosen for size differences, different social organization, and a wide geographic and taxonomic distribution (Apidae, Megachilidae, Andrenidae. Halictidae). The results demonstrate the following characteristics for the typical compound eye in female foraging bees: (1) the vertical diameter of the eye is about twice the horizontal diameter; (2) the eyes of diurnal foragers scale isometrically with body size; (3) the eyes of three species of nocturnal foragers have about 1.8 times the surface area as compared to diurnal foragers of matching size; (4) the number of ommatidia per eye range from about 1000 in Perdita minima to about 16 000 in Xhlocopa latipes; and (5) the corresponding mean interommatidial angles range from 4.7 to 1.2degrees. Body size, rather than species-specific ecological adaptation, is the major (97%) determinant of the number of ommatidia per eye in diurnal, as well as nocturnal foragers. The number of ommatidia per eye, and hence the visual resolution, is proportional to the square root of both body size and eye size across all species studied. The eye parameter (the product of the mean interommatidial angle and the mean lens diameter) increases slightly with decreasing body size. All this is taken as evidence that the features of the bees' visual macro-niche remained largely constant over the roughly 130 million years of their macro-evolution. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The speed at which the liquid is transferred (unloading rate) from donor to recipient is related to the profitability offered by the recently visited food source. Two of the main characteristics that define food source profitability are the flow of solution delivered by the feeder and the time invested by the forager feeding at the source (feeding time). To investigate which of these two variables is related to unloading rate, we individually trained donor foragers to a regulated-flow feeder that presented changes in the delivered flow of solution within a single foraging bout, while feuding time remained constant. With the range of flows used, bees attained maximum crop loads in all experiments, During the subsequent trophallactic encounter with an unfed recipient hivemate, unloading rate was differentially affected by the changes in flow of solution presented during the previous foraging trip at the source, depending on whether there had been an increase or a decrease of flow rate within that visit. Foragers unloaded at lower rates when they experienced a decrease in flow rate, but did not increase the unloading rate when presented with an increase at the food source. Thus, forager honeybees seem to be able to detect variations in the delivered flow of solution, since they modulate unloading rate in relation to these changes, although decreases in food value seem to be perceptually weighted in relation to increases, independently of the time invested in the food-gathering process.

In this study the habitat use of bumblebees was investigated on Salisbury Plain Training Area, the largest remaining area of unimproved chalk grassland in north-west Europe. Habitat characteristics influencing the overall abundance, species richness and foraging activity of bumblebees included the diversity and abundance of flowering plant species (particularly of favoured forage plants such as Trifolium pratense), vegetation structure and height. It is suggested that different Bombus species respond to these habitat characteristics depending on their specific foraging and nesting requirements, the case of Bombus humilis being especially relevant. The effects of several grassland management practices were considered in terms of their suitability for the conservation of bumblebee habitats. Cattle grazing was shown to be preferable to both sheep grazing and the absence of any management, although the timing and intensity of such grazing was important. Small-scale disturbances caused by vehicle activity were also of value in producing locally abundant forage resources in less intensively managed grasslands. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The efficiency of recruitment with and without transmission of direction information in the waggle dance was quantified using artificial, plentiful unscented food sources and hives which were turned to a horizontal position to disrupt orientation of dancing bees and thereby eliminate the spatial information from dances. Transmission of location information seems to improve recruitment effect particularly at large distances. Recruitment declines more rapidly with distance if dances are disoriented, and for large distances it takes a few hours before a foraging group is established. However, this shows that even without dance information, foragers manage to recruit some bees to their food source. This process, however, is so slow that by the time a group of recruits has reached the food source, it may not be worth exploiting any more. Transmission of spatial information thus is especially important if distant food sources which often change in nectar availability are exploited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8177,,,,,,2002,26,2,,,,,93,100,,,,,,,,,WOS:000177978900003,,,,,

For a given diet. offspring body size generally increases with an increase in the amount of food consumed as a larva, but the extent to which body size is influenced by the type of food consumed is poorly known. Pollen ranges from 2-60% protein among plant species, and bees are extremely efficient at assimilating nitrogen; therefore, it seems likely that either parent bees adjust the size of larval provisions to compensate for differences in pollen protein concentration or bee offspring attain different body size depending on the pollen type(s) consumed as a larva, We presented the generalist sweat bee Lasioglossum zephyrum with pollen diets that differed in protein content and monitored offspring body size during two experiments. In a protein supplementation experiment, diets ranged from 20-66% protein and consisted of Typha pollen amended with soy protein. On a pollen/soy diet, offspring body size increased 25% with a shift from 20-37% protein, but did not increase further at greater protein concentrations, In a multiple pollen experiment, pollen diets ranged from 20-39% protein and consisted of eight pollens that differed naturally in protein concentration. The largest offspring arose from the most protein-rich pollens, whereas much smaller bees developed on protein-poor pollens, Provision size only predicted offspring size when pollen type, and therefore protein quantity, was considered. Adult foragers did not adjust provision size to compensate for pollen protein, Therefore, offspring body size appears to result from a combination of controlled (provision size) and uncontrolled (pollen quality) factors that arise out of bee foraging decisions.",,,,"Cane, James H/C-1636-2019; Roulston, Tai/AAI-4974-2020; Cane, James/P-5137-2019","Cane, James H/0000-0002-4745-382X; Cane, James/0000-0002-4745-382X",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-7653,,,,,,2002,16,1,,,,,49,65,,10.1023/A:1016048526475,,,,,,,WOS:000177251600004,,,,,

One way is to partition the task into a number of sequential stages in which material is passed from one worker to another in a relay fashion. This relatively new concept is known as task partitioning. In this study, we focus on a particular form of task partitioning, bucket brigades, which we define as a multistage (i.e., three or more stages) partitioned transport scheme that uses only direct transfer between individual workers and without any predetermined transfer locations, other than the first or last stages. We first consider the potential costs and benefits of bucket brigades compared to other transportation schemes. We then use theory and computer simulation to analyse some of these aspects in detail. In one empirical study of a bucket brigade, foragers were generally found to be sequenced from smallest (near the food source) to fastest (nearest the nest). This exactly matches what dynamical systems theory would predict as an ergonomically efficient solution. However, we also demonstrate that a single and simple local rule - larger ants win fights over material - will generate this sequencing as an epiphenomenon that is not necessarily optimal. We use the behaviour of bucket brigades to reveal some general points about the optimality of task partitioning in more detail.",,,,"Boomsma, Jacobus J/M-2785-2014","Boomsma, Jacobus J/0000-0002-3598-1609",,,,,,,,,,,,0020-1812,,,,,,2002,49,2,,,,,171,180,,10.1007/s00040-002-8298-7,,,,,,,WOS:000176750600013,,,,,

Here, I investigate covariation between striking geographic variation in pollinator fauna and the mating system of a widespread self-compatible wetland plant, Decodon verticillatus. Flower visitor surveys in two northern populations from Canada and three southern populations from the southeastern United States revealed that flowers in northern populations were visited primarily by bumblebees (30%), nonnative honeybees (39%), and small, apparently ineffective, pollinators including wasps, flies, and solitary bees (31%). In contrast, southern populations were visited by butterflies (27%), large native bees (Bombus and Xylocopa; 65%), and only rarely by honeybees (2%). The frequency of visits to inflorescences was also much higher in southern () than in northern populations (1.1/ h). The foraging behavior of mean = 3.3/h butterflies may enhance outcrossing by reducing geitonogamy, the predominant mode of self-fertilization in northern populations. Compared to bees, butterflies moved between inflorescences more frequently (64% vs. 43% of the time) and flew longer distances between inflorescences ( medians = 50 vs. 25 cm). Despite large regional differences in visitor composition and movement patterns, multilocus estimates of the proportion of outcrossed progeny did not differ between five southern populations (; mean +/- SE = 0.75 +/- 0.04 range = 0.65-0.87) and 10 northern populations (0.72 +/- 0.02; 0.62-0.86). Similarly, the fixation index of mature plants did not differ from 0 in either northern or southern populations.

Alternatively, a larger display may reduce fitness by increasing pollen movement within an individual. In dichogamous species the frequency of this geitonogamy also depends on floral gender ratio and pollinator response to floral gender and to inflorescence architecture. We explored the relationships of floral display size and dichogamy to potential geitonogamy in Campanula americana, a protandrous herb. We observed pollinators in a natural population, in which individuals differed in display size, gender ratio, and distance to conspecifics, and in experimental arrays, in which individuals differed only in display size. In both settings, bees responded to increased floral displays by increasing the number and length of foraging bouts. The number of potentially geitonogamous visits, those to female-phase flowers after male-phase flowers, also increased with display size. In addition, although proportion of flowers visited did not increase with the floral display, the proportion of geitonogamous visits did. There was no evidence that dichogamy reduced the potential for geitonogamy. The ratio of male-to female-phase flowers did not affect bee behavior, and bees did not display a gender preference. In contrast to other studies, the presentation of female-phase flowers below male-phase flowers on reproductive branches did not reduce geitonogamy. Variation in floral display size may cause the mating system to vary among populations. We found that display size varied among 12 populations and that geitonogamy may be infrequent in many populations as a result of small display sizes.

Experimental nests were placed out in conventional farmland, in farmland with flower-rich conservation measures and in suburban areas. Nests gained weight more quickly and attained a larger final size in suburban areas compared to elsewhere. The diversity of pollens gathered by bees was highest in suburban areas, and lowest in conventional farmland. Nests in suburban areas were also more prone to attack by the specialist bumblebee parasite Aphomia sociella, suggesting that this moth is more abundant in suburban areas than elsewhere. Overall, our results demonstrate that gardens provide a greater density and diversity of floral resources than farmland, and probably support larger populations of B. terrestris. Contrary to expectation, schemes deployed to enhance farmland biodiversity appear to have little measurable impact on nest growth of this bumblebee species.

In addition, high-speed video recordings of the position of the wings over the course of the wing stroke, and morphological measurements, allowed us to calculate the aerodynamic and inertial power requirements. The total power output required from the pectoralis muscle was, on average, 390 W kg(-1), which was similar to the highest measurements made on bundles of muscle fibres in vitro (433 W kg(-1)), although for one individual a power output of 530 W kg(-1) was calculated. The majority of the power was required to increase the potential energy of the body. The power output of these muscles is the highest yet found for any muscle in repetitive contractions. We also calculated the power requirements during takeoff flights in four other species in the family Phasianidae. Power output was found to be independent of body mass in this family. However, the precise scaling of burst power output within this group must await a better assessment of whether similar levels of performance were measured across the group. We extended our analysis to one species of hawk, several species of hummingbird and two species of bee. Remarkably, we concluded that, over a broad range of body size (0.0002-5 kg) and contractile frequency (5-186 Hz), the myofibrillar power output of flight muscles during short maximal bursts is very high (360-460 W kg(-1)) and shows very little scaling with body mass.

An alternative signal could be the vibrations of the comb at 200-300 Hz generated by dancing bees but which, without amplification, may not be large enough to alert remote dance-followers. We describe here, however, an unexpected property of honeycomb when it is subjected to vibration at around 200Hz that would represent an effective amplification of the vibratory signals for remote dance-followers. We find that, at a specific distance from the origin of an imposed vibration, the walls across a single comb cell abruptly reverse the phase of their displacement and move in opposite directions to one another. Behavioural measurements show that the distance from which the majority of remote dance-followers are recruited coincides with the location of this phase-reversal phenomenon relative to the signal source. We propose that effective signal amplification by the phase-reversal phenomenon occurs when bees straddle a cell across which the phase reversal is expressed. Such a bee would be subjected to a situation in which the legs were moving towards and away from one another instead of in the same direction. In this manner, remote dance-followers could be alerted to a dancer performing in their vicinity.",,,,"Casas, Jerome/D-9620-2011","Casas, Jerome/0000-0003-1666-295X",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,NOV,2001,204,21,,,,,3737,3746,,,,,,,,,WOS:000172309900013,11719537,,,,

Although travelling farther to harvest a greater net energetic reward is beneficial, many animals opt for a smaller net reward that requires less travel. Recent discoveries of a visual basis for flower constancy in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, led us to examine older reports that colour cues are superceded by energetic considerations. Here we show that when individual bees foraged on pedicellate artificial flowers varying in colour and interfloral distance, their behaviour depended on the colours in the choice test. Colours of similar spectral reflectance (blue versus white), that would be clustered in the bee's visual colour space, elicited more visits to the closest flower when rewards were equal, but individuals travelled a greater distance to harvest a higher energetic reward when reward quality varied. Bees chose the closest flower more often when reward volume decreased while quality remained constant. Yet, even when all flowers were identical (morphology and reward), and only interfloral distance varied, bees did not always visit the closest flower. A dramatic difference was seen when the dimorphism was yellow-blue, colours quite separate in the bee colour space and known to elicit constancy behaviour. Here, bees visited the closest flower only 5% of the time, and varying reward volume did not elicit different behaviour. Animals thus display differential foraging behaviour with respect to environmental cues that must be considered when asking questions about other behavioural parameters.

Reduced gene flow by pollen should in turn produce greater population differentiation among populations of D. barbeyi relative to D. nuttallianum. We tested these predictions by comparing pollinator behavior, breeding systems, outcrossing rates, and population genetic structure of sympatric populations of the two species in Colorado. Bumble bee and hummingbird pollinators visit more flowers and inflorescences per foraging bout in D. barbeyi than in D. nuttallianum.

Gradients of primary and secondary infection from point sources of ascospores and conidia placed in separate plant rows were recorded in each of 2 years at two sites with no history of the disease. Primary infection gradients were longer downwind than upwind, with 95% of blighted shoots occurring within 30 in of the ascospore point source. This observation, along with a positive correlation (r = 0.852, P = 0.0072, n = 8) between the distance over which shoot blight occurred and wind speed parallel to the row, supports the role of wind as a key factor in ascospore dispersal. By contrast, secondary infection gradients were shorter downwind and longer upwind, with 95% of infected fruit occurring within 20 in of the conidial point source. The shorter downwind spread of secondary infection, along with a nonsignificant correlation (r = -0.649, P = 0.0812, n = 8) between the distance over which infected fruit occurred and wind speed, suggests that factors other than wind are important in the transfer of conidia to open flowers; this could include conidial dispersal by bee pollinators, which have been shown previously to forage primarily upwind.

The present study investigated the dependence of haemolymph sugar levels in foraging honeybees on metabolic rate and whether the haemolymph sugar level is regulated. Free-flying foraging bees were trained to collect controlled amounts of sucrose solution of different concentrations (15 %, 30 % or 50 % sucrose w/w). Immediately after feeding, metabolic rate was measured over a given time depending on the sucrose concentration, then crop-emptying rate and haemolymph sugar levels were measured. Bees exhibiting a wide range of metabolic rates were compared to establish whether the observed differences in haemolymph sugar levels were due to limits in the supply of sugars from the crop or in the rate of trehalose synthesis in the fat bodies. Independent of the concentration of the sucrose solution supplied, haemolymph trehalose, glucose and fructose levels were constant for metabolic rates from 0 to 4.5 ml CO2 h(-1). At higher metabolic rates, trehalose concentration decreased while that of glucose and fructose increased, with the exception of bees fed 15 % sucrose solution. As the supply of sugar from the crop via the proventriculus was sufficient to support even the highest metabolic rates, the observed pattern must result from an upper limit in the capacity of the fat body to synthesise trehalose. The maximal rate of conversion of glucose to trehalose in the fat body was therefore calculated to average 92.4 mug glucose min(-1). However, for bees fed 15 % sucrose solution both the rate of conversion of glucose to trehalose and the rate of sugar transport from the crop to the ventricle were limited, together resulting in a decrease in total haemolymph sugar levels for metabolic rates higher than 5 ml CO2 h(-1).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,AUG,2001,204,15,,,,,2709,2716,,,,,,,,,WOS:000170563500012,11533121,,,,

Dispersers from queenright A. m. capensis colonies were more often found in queenless host colonies and vice versa, indicating active host searching and/or a queenstate-discriminating guarding mechanism. Our data show that A. m. capensis workers disperse significantly more often than other races of A. mellifera, suggesting that dispersing represents a host finding mechanism.

J,"Anderson, C; McShea, DW",,,,"Anderson, C; McShea, DW",,,"Individual versus social complexity, with particular reference to ant colonies",BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Insect societies - colonies of ants, bees, wasps and termites - vary enormously in their social complexity. Social complexity is a broadly used term that encompasses many individual and colony-level traits and characteristics such as colony size, polymorphism and foraging strategy. A number of earlier studies have considered the relationships among various correlates of social complexity in insect societies; in this review, we build upon those studies by proposing additional correlates and show how all correlates can be integrated in a common explanatory framework. The various correlates are divided among four broad categories (sections). Under 'polyphenism' we consider the differences among individuals, in particular focusing upon 'caste' and specialization of individuals. This is followed by a section on 'totipotency' in which we consider the autonomy and subjugation of individuals. Under this heading we consider various aspects such as intracolony conflict, worker reproductive potential and physiological or morphological restrictions which limit individuals' capacities to perform a range of tasks or functions. A section entitled 'organization of work' considers a variety of aspects, e.g. the ability to tackle group, team or partitioned tasks, foraging strategies and colony reliability and efficiency. A final section, 'communication and functional integration', considers how individual activity is coordinated to produce an integrated and adaptive colony. Within each section we use illustrative examples drawn from the social insect literature (mostly from ants, for which there is the best data) to illustrate concepts or trends and make a number of predictions concerning how a particular trait is expected to correlate with other aspects of social complexity. Within each section we also expand the scope of the arguments to consider these relationships in a much broader sense of 'sociality' by drawing parallels with other 'social' entities such as multicellular individuals, which can be understood as 'societies' of cells. The aim is to draw out any parallels and common causal relationships among the correlates. Two themes run through the study. The first is the role of colony size as an important factor affecting social complexity. The second is the complexity of individual workers in relation to the complexity of the colony. Consequently, this is an ideal opportunity to test a previously proposed hypothesis that 'individuals of highly social ant species are less complex than individuals from simple ant species' in light of numerous social correlates. Our findings support this hypothesis. In summary, we conclude that, in general, complex societies are characterized by large colony size, worker polymorphism, strong behavioural specialization and loss of totipotency in its workers, low individual complexity, decentralized colony control and high system redundancy, low individual competence, a high degree of worker cooperation when tackling tasks, group foraging strategies, high tempo, multi-chambered tailor-made nests, high functional integration, relatively greater use of cues and modulatory signals to coordinate individuals and heterogeneous patterns of worker-worker interaction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1464-7931,,,,,MAY,2001,76,2,,,,,211,237,,10.1017/S1464793101005656,,,,,,,WOS:000168769100002,11396847,,,,

In the case of honeybees, foragers returning from a nectar source transfer the food collected to receiver colony-mates through oral contact. Previous studies have shown that the speed of nectar transfer within each contact (unloading rate) increases when foragers return from feeding sites with higher profitability, i.e. with more concentrated sugar solutions or higher solution flow rates. However, there is no evidence that the nectar unloading rate is actually evaluated by hive-mates during food exchange. To investigate this, trophallaxis between donor bees returning from a feeder with different how rates of sucrose solution (range 1.0-8.2 mul min(-1) of 50 % w/w sucrose solution) and receiver hive-mates was studied by combining behavioural and infrared thermal analysis. The results show that when foraging bees returned from a feeder delivering a higher how rate they initiated unloading at higher thoracic temperatures and transferred the solution at higher speed. During these food exchanges, the thoraces of receiver bees warmed up faster in proportion to increasing forager temperature and unloading rate. Therefore, whatever the variable actually evaluated by receivers (mostly nectar processors, i.e. bees that handle nectar in the hive) during trophallaxis (unloading rate and/or donor thoracic temperature), they raised their activity level in proportion to that of the foragers. In this way, receiver bees will intensify their nectar processing when nectar foragers return from more profitable sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,MAY,2001,204,9,,,,,1653,1658,,,,,,,,,WOS:000168771400012,11398754,,,,

Fruit were sampled from trees at regular intervals along transects that extended beyond (either across or along row) each pollinator cultivar and the percentage of seeds that were sired by the pollen donor was estimated using allozyme markers.

However, the average dispersal distance across rows, expressed in metres or trees, (17.4 m +/- 3.6, 3.6 +/- 0.7 trees) did not differ from that along rows (5.8 m +/- 4.1, 2.7 +/- 0.8 trees).

Genetic polymorphisms of flowering plants can influence pollinator foraging but it is not known whether heritable foraging polymorphisms of pollinators influence their pollination efficacies. Honey bees Apis mellifera L. visit cranberry flowers for nectar but rarely for pollen when alternative preferred flowers grow nearby. 2. Cranberry flowers visited once by pollen-foraging honey bees received fourfold more stigmatic pollen than flowers visited by mere nectar-foragers (excluding nectar thieves). Manual greenhouse pollinations with fixed numbers of pollen tetrads (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) achieved maximal fruit set with just eight pollen tetrads. Pollen-foraging honey bees yielded a calculated 63% more berries than equal numbers of non-thieving nectar-foragers, even though both classes of forager made stigmatic contact. 3. Colonies headed by queens of a pollen-hoarding genotype fielded significantly more pollen-foraging trips than standard commercial genotypes, as did hives fitted with permanently engaged pollen traps or colonies containing more larvae. Pollen-hoarding colonies together brought back twice as many cranberry pollen loads as control colonies, which was marginally significant despite marked daily variation in the proportion of collected pollen that was cranberry. 4. Caloric supplementation of matched, paired colonies failed to enhance pollen foraging despite the meagre nectar yields of individual cranberry flowers. 5. Heritable behavioural polymorphisms of the honey bee, such as pollen-hoarding, can enhance fruit and seed set by a floral host (e.g. cranberry), but only if more preferred pollen hosts are absent or rare. Otherwise, honey bees' broad polylecty, flight range, and daily idiosyncrasies in floral fidelity will obscure specific pollen-foraging differences at a given floral host, even among paired colonies in a seemingly uniform agricultural setting.",,,,"Cane, James H/C-1636-2019","Cane, James H/0000-0002-4745-382X",,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,,,,,APR,2001,26,2,,,,,117,123,,10.1046/j.1365-2311.2001.00309.x,,,,,,,WOS:000168256000002,,,,,

Thorax temperature during dancing was quite variable (31.4-43 degreesC). In the course of a foraging season it varied considerably and was always lower than in bees foraging from a highly profitable food source (2 molar sucrose 120 m from the hive). It averaged 38.0 degreesC (SD=2.24, n=224 dances) in the nectar foragers and 37.4 degreesC (SD=1.64, n=171) in the pollen foragers, resembling that of dancers foraging 0.5 molar sucrose from feeders with unlimited flow. Hive air temperature accounted only for about 3-8% of total variation. Foraging distance modulated dancing temperature in a way that, according to the decrease of the profitability of foraging with distance, maximum temperatures decreased and, in accordance with the increase of the dancing threshold with distance, minumum temperatures increased with distance, this way providing new support for the hypothesis that the dancing temperature is modulated by the profitability of foraging and the dancing and foraging motivation of the bees. Dancing temperature of both nectar and pollen dancers correlated with several parameters of the hive status, increasing with the amount of brood and decreasing with the amount of honey and pollen. These correlations are discussed with respect to literature reports on a colony's need for pollen and nectar, in particular the effect of brood and the amount of pollen on pollen foraging, and the effect of honey stores and demand for nectar on nectar foraging.

This study investigates the impact of logging in Thailand and forest fragmentation in Costa Rica on the pollination and seed production of two self-incompatible forest trees. Logging in a dry deciduous dipterocarp forest in Thailand resulted in reduced densities of the common dipterocarp tree Shorea siamensis and variably isolated individual trees. The number of flower visits to S. siamensis by pollinating Trigona bees was not affected by logging disturbance. However, pollinators did spend longer periods of time foraging in the canopies of isolated trees which were more prevalent in logged areas where tree density had been reduced. Consequently, at the logged site few cross-pollinations were effected and fruit set of S. siamensis was considerably lower than at nearby unlogged sites where distances between flowering conspecifics were smaller. Reduced fruit set has long-term implications for the recovery of S. siamensis populations in disturbed areas, and local population genetic structure is likely to be affected as reduced outcrossing rates among trees in disturbed regions results in relatively inbred seed. In Costa Rica forest fragmentation has restricted the once widespread tree Anacardium excelsum to forest patches located in an agriculturally-dominated landscape. As with S. siamensis, the abundance of pollinators, also Trigona bees, in the canopies of A. excelsum was largely unaffected by fragment size. Nevertheless, pollination success and seed production was positively correlated with fragment size. We propose that small bees rarely move between forest fragments and gene exchange through pollination occurs predominantly among trees within fragments and, together with likely low genetic variability in small fragments, that this contributes to the observed reduced fertilisation and seed set of A. excelsum. Thus increased tree isolation tree through selective logging or habitat fragmentation by forest clearance can result in reduced seed set due to changes in the foraging patterns of poorly mobile pollinators. Even if population sizes of the pollinators are maintained following environmental perturbation, this study shows that disturbance may disrupt pollination processes through changes in pollinator foraging behaviour. More attention needs to be focussed on changes in the behaviour of species involved in key ecological interactions following disturbance events in tropical forests.",,,,"Ghazoul, Jaboury/B-2121-2018",,,,,,,,,,,,,1385-0237,,,,,APR,2001,153,1-Feb,,,,,335,345,,10.1023/A:1017542124699,,,,,,,WOS:000170943700028,,,,,

Their numbers followed seasonal trends shown in independent studies, thus indicating bee abundance and activity in a large area. No measurable population-level impact of competition between this invading honey bee and native bees, despite many demonstrations of resource competition at flower patch and colony levels, changed annual abundances of all 15 native bee species. Native bee abundance did not decrease, nor did native bees show substantial reciprocal yearly change with honey bee abundance. One strong negative correlation of bee catches with an extremely rainy year was found. However, multiple regression using rainfall and honey bee abundance as the independent variables showed that neither was responsible for bee population change over 17 years. Nearly half the native species declined during a year that displayed peak honey bee number.

Orchis boryi is food deceptive and obligatorily insect pollinated. Primary pollinators were Apis mellifera and Bombus spp., which foraged on rewarding plant species nearby and visited O. boryi in between. To analyse floral colour similarity among rewarding plants and O. boryi as perceived by bees, a model of bee colour vision was employed. For each food plant an index was calculated that described the probability of a bee foraging on it to subsequently choose an orchid newer. This choice probability correlated to colour distance according to the model of bee colour vision, indicating that bees chose the deceptive orchid more frequently if they foraged on more similarly coloured species. At different sites different plant species served as models. Bees foraging on food plants from which a high choice rate to the orchid was observed visited the orchid less often after approaching it than other bees, which is likely to reflect avoidance learning. In general, the pollination syndrome appears to be a generalized form of Batesian mimicry, in which similarity to rewarding plants determines reproductive success. As expected by negative density-dependent selection, individual fruit set and pollinia export rate correlated negatively with orchid density, but were unaffected by food plant density, orchid frequency, individual variation of labellum colour, labellum size, or mouth width of the flowers.

Workers' ovaries declined quickly after an initial phase of partial development. The period of ovary decline overlapped with the age range at which most workers began performing tasks on the exterior nest surface.

Flowers are mostly hermaphrodite, inconspicuous, small, and green. Six species are dioecious. Over 806 of the cosexual species are self compatible. However, many species are dichogamous (mostly protandrous); thus, even the self-compatible species may require pollen transfer. Selfing through geitonogamy seems to be the most common system, and several species express mixed breeding systems. Floral visitors are uncommon to rare, except for two hummingbird species (one native and one endemic) that visit five species we studied. In more than 300 h of observation of flowers over three field seasons, we detected only 23 native insect visits representing ten species (Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Coleoptera). One species each of an introduced ant and an introduced bee were also observed on some flowers, all near the single human settlement of San Juan Bautista. Wind directly moving pollen, or indirectly via shaking the flowers. is the most important pollen distribution mechanism. The majority of the wind-pollinated species bear some typical anemophilous features, but also others not characteristic of wind pollination, that presumably represent the condition of their biotically pollinated ancestors.

A reproductive female can raise the first generation of brood alone (independent foundation), or a colony can divide into autonomous parts in which the reproductive female is helped by sterile relatives (fission, budding, swarming). In independent-founding ants, queens can histolize their flight muscles after dispersal; in many species, large flight muscles and metabolic reserves reduce or eliminate the need for risky foraging trips during the vulnerable solitary stage. Colony division is a derived strategy, and we review the selective pressures leading to its occurrence in the different social taxa. In various ants, fission coexists with independent foundation, and alate queens are retained. However, in ants exhibiting obligate fission (e.g. all army ants and many Ponerinae), queens are permanently wingless (ergatoid), or the queen caste is missing altogether. When reproductive females are flightless, dispersal distances and colonization ability are reduced, and there are extensive modifications in mating behavior and resource allocation. We focus on the characteristics of fission in the phylogenetically primitive ants Ponerinae in which both ergatoid queens and gamergates occur.

A simple and tractable mathematical model of the honey bee scout-recruit system was developed to study the relationship between nectar availability, the efficiency of the honey bee's recruitment system, and the optimal proportion of scouts that maximizes net gain (benefit - cost), or, energetic efficiency (benefit/cost - 1). The models consider both the energetic costs and benefits of active scouts and recruits as well as the cost of an inactive forager reserve. They predict conditions when individual foraging is favored over the honey bee's recruitment system, when the colony should abandon foraging altogether, and the optimal proportion of scouts (when the scout-recruit system is favored). The models' predictions qualitatively match empirical data. Surprisingly, previous empirical data from the honey bee suggest that recruits' costs are greater than scouts'-recruits spend significantly longer searching for a forage patch than do scouts-thereby causing researchers to rethink how the scout-recruit system might be adaptive. Using average returns, the models demonstrate how the scout-recruit system is adaptive despite these apparent higher recruit costs relative to the scouts'. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the results are robust to a broad range of relative costs of active workers, inactive workers, and the energetic benefits of the forage. Consequently, the model is demonstrated to be relevant to many insect societies that employ a scout-recruit system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045-2249,1465-7279,,,,JAN-FEB,2001,12,1,,,,,111,119,,10.1093/oxfordjournals.beheco.a000372,,,,,,,WOS:000166152000016,,,,,

We established a total of 15 arrays of potted plants isolated by 50-400 m from ten natural ""source"" populations, as well as control arrays embedded within each source. Flowers on potted plants were emasculated, so any pollen received could be assumed to come from source populations. A total of 69 h of observation suggested that pollinators were somewhat less abundant in isolates than in controls, but visited more plants and flowers once within an isolate. Consistent with this, 82.1% of all flowers in isolated arrays received pollen, versus 87.7% in controls. Mean receipt was more than 100 pollen grains per flower in most arrays, and seed set in isolates and controls respectively averaged 69.8% and 74.3% of ovules. Furthermore, pollen receipt in isolates declined relatively slowly with distance from the source. We conclude that pollinators of D. nuttallianum often will fly up to 400 m among populations, and that substantial pollination ensues.

Number of bee-eater colonies increased with number of food sources (hives and apiaries); conversely total bird population and colony size were not related to food sources. Bee-caters preyed on bees (foragers) in relation to their mean total availability (calculated over all study areas), but predation on bees occur-red also where hives were absent or far away. By contrast, predation on drones was negatively correlated to their mean total availability. Indeed, predation on foragers and drones correlated negatively. Predation impact on foragers was on average 0.37% (range: 0.26-0.58%) of their mean total availability during May-July. The daily forager mortality per hive due to bee-eater predation represented on average 6.1% (n = 73) of their total daily mortality per hive. Predation pressure on drones was on average 0.91% (range: 0.27-1.43%) of their mean total availability during May-July. The daily drone mortality per hive due to bee-cater predation represented on average 30% (n = 4) of their total daily mortality per hive. Predation impact by bee-eaters on foragers was independent from prey density. Conversely, predation on drones was inversely dependent from prey density, thus it was diluted at high hive densities. The economic impact on apiculture by bee-caters was in general negligible, but losses of drones were locally important and potentially detrimental to small or specialized apicultures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0249-7395,,,,,,2001,56,4,,,,,373,388,,,,,,,,,WOS:000172556900005,,,,,

These foraging profiles were analysed to determine whether they were characteristic of various floral morphologies in predictable ways. It was found that although visitor profiles were sometimes consistent with classic pollination syndromes, these syndromes were unreliable predictors of floral visitors. Very few flowers were exclusively bird-pollinated, and none were strictly fly-, beetle-, wasp-, or butterfly-pollinated. The majority of flowering plants were unspecialized in their morphology, and consequently hosted a diverse array of visitors. In addition, visitor profiles to congeners with similar floral morphologies, and even to conspecifics, differed between habitats. Altitude was a major factor in determining visitors, with flies being the most abundant visitors above 700 m. However, congeners in several genera of Epacridaceae, as well as the genus Correa, which differed in floral morphology also differed in visitor profiles. Tubular flowers were associated with birds, while flowers with more accessible nectar were visited by insects. The only taxa exhibiting a bee-pollination syndrome that were largely visited by bees were the Fabaceae and Goodenia ovata Sm. Several species with purple or pink flowers were also predominantly visited by bees, but did not strictly conform to the melittophilous syndrome. In contrast, other flowers exhibiting an ostensibly mellitophilous syndrome hosted very few bees. Of these, species that occurred at high altitude were mainly visited by flies, while others received very few potential pollen vectors.",,,,"McQuillan, Peter/C-2373-2014","McQuillan, Peter/0000-0001-6334-372X",,,,,,,,,,,,1442-9985,,,,,DEC,2000,25,6,,,,,600,609,,10.1046/j.1442-9993.2000.01059.x,,,,,,,WOS:000166527300004,,,,,

A previous study of pollen dispersal in which the transfer of individually marked pollinia was monitored, indicated not only that populations of the nonrewarding, bumblebee-pollinated orchid Calypso bulbosa are connected by substantial levels of gene flow, but also that seed production may be the result of self-fertilization to a considerable extent. We examined the genetic structure of 21 C. bulbosa populations in northern Sweden by F-statistics analyses of variation at three polymorphic allozyme loci. Four populations each consisted of two or three distinct patches, which also allowed us to evaluate among-patch differentiation. The inbreeding coefficient over all loci within populations was high (F-IS=0.283). F-statistics indicated that the level of genetic differentiation among patches within populations varied among populations. F-ST among patches within populations ranged between -0.021 and 0.119 and was significantly different from zero in two of the populations. There was low to moderate genetic differentiation among populations (F-ST=0.072). A Mantel test indicated a positive correlation between geographical and genetic distances among populations, but this correlation was dependent on the difference in allele frequencies between the southernmost population sampled and all other populations. Self-fertilization and substructuring within sampling units (within patches and populations) may have contributed to the high inbreeding coefficients observed in many C. bulbosa populations.

Most crops represent temporal foraging habitats with high abundance of bumblebees but mainly with low diversity in the bumblebee forage community, in contrast to permanent foraging habitats such as, for example, a hedgerow. The high numbers of bumblebees in the monoculture of crop plantations consisted mainly of short-tongued bumblebee species. The role of foraging distances for the visitation rate of foraging habitats was studied by performing capture-recapture experiments with natural nests of Bombus terrestris, Bombus lapidarius and Bombus muscorum. Differences were found on the species as well as the individual level. The foraging distances of B. muscorum were more restricted to the neighbourhood of the nesting habitat than the foraging activity of B. terrestris and B. lapidarius. High percentages of B. terrestris workers were recaptured while foraging on super-abundant resources in distances up to 1750 m from the nest. Isolated patches of highly rewarding forage crops, in agricultural landscapes, are probably only accessed by bumblebee species with large mean foraging distances, such as the short-tongued B. terrestris. Species like the rare, long-tongued B. muscorum depend on a close connection between nesting and foraging habitat. A restricted foraging radius might be one important factor of bumblebee species loss and potential pollinator limitation in modern agricultural landscapes.

Interactions among these attributes of flowers and butterflies were investigated, using data from a field study in Cornwall and from Porter et al. (1992). The maximum corolla depth from which a butterfly can feed depends on tongue length, which correlates with the more easily measured attributes of body mass and wing loading. Small, short-tongued butterflies did not visit deep flowers. The quantity of nectar sugar per flower necessary for profitable foraging depends on foraging costs, which are expected to correlate with wing loading. Butterfly species with a high wing loading generally confined their visits to flowers that were clustered or very nectar-rich. Butterfly species with a low wing loading included solitary and less nectar-rich flowers in their diet. Body mass and wing loading affect a butterfly's load-carrying capacity (limiting the distance between fuelling stops) and cooling rate (limiting the distance between stops for basking or endothermic warming), and will therefore influence the capacity for floral selectivity and for migration and dispersal. Body mass, wing loading and tongue length characterised families or subfamilies of butterflies. For example vanessine nymphalids, with their long tongues and high wing loading, visited the deep, massed flowers of Buddleja davidii, but lycaenids, with their short tongues and low wing loading, did not. These often visited members of the Asteraceae. Eupatorium cannabinum, with massed flowers offering abundant and accessible nectar, was visited by butterflies of all tongue lengths and both high and low wing loading.

The results confirm that neither the bee species nor the geographical location determine the chemical composition of Meliponinae propolis and the choice of its plant source, respectively.

We placed workers from lines selected at the colony level for high or low pollen stores together with hybrid workers into a common hive environment with controlled access to resources. Workers from the selected lines showed reciprocal variation in pollen and nectar collection. High-pollen-line foragers collected pollen preferentially, and low-pollen-line workers collected nectar, indicating that the two tasks covary genetically.

We monitored the responses of workers from the selected strains to changes in internal (colony) and external (resource) stimulus levels for pollen foraging to measure the interaction between genotypic variation in foraging behavior and stimulus environment.

The observed foraging distances described in this study may not be exceptional in a patchy environment where differences in patch size and patch quality are large.

The maximum thoracic value of an individual bee was 44.5 degrees C. At higher T-A (20.9-27.2 degrees C) head and abdomen were only about 3 degrees C and 2 degrees C on the average higher than the surroundings, respectively. In the lower range of T-A (13.6-16.6 degrees C), however, the bees warmed their heads up to 29.2 degrees C (13 degrees C above T-A) and the abdomen up to 23.3 degrees C (7.1 degrees C above T-A; mean values of the measuring periods). The head and abdomen were even provided independently of one another with heat from the thorax. At a higher T-A only little heat came from the heated thorax into the abdomen, at a cooler T-A (13.6-16.6 degrees C) more heat reached the abdomen.

In western Europe, L. malachurum exhibits north-south clines of increasing colony size associated with the production of more worker broods, and worker production of males, but societies conform to the model of a classically eusocial hymenopteran insect. A population of L. malachurum studied from 1994 to 1998 at Agios Nikolaos Monemvasias in southern Greece exhibits a startlingly different type of social structure. Dissections of female bees collected while foraging on flowers or from excavations of nests showed that the majority of mid- to late-summer workers are mated and (or) have developing ovaries, indicating that some workers are highly reproductive. Nest excavations indicated that in many or most colonies, the queen has disappeared by midsummer, before ovipositing the final, reproductive brood. In orphan nests, workers become the major reproductives, which suggests that males and gynes in the final brood are the offspring of workers. The very long breeding season in southern Greece may explain why colonies often outlive their queen.

The multicellular nests are described and illustrated. Cell depth ranged from 3.5-12 cm. Provision mass, egg placement, and larval feeding are similar to what has been reported for other Melissodes. The cocoon is described and illustrated. Parasitic bees, Triepeolus sp., were active at the nest site and frequently entered M microsticta nests although no parasitized cells were recovered. The bee-hunting wasp, Philanthus crabroniformis Smith, was observed capturing a male M. microsticta on one occasion and unsuccessful attacks on males and females were observed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-0603,,,,,JUL,2000,76,3,,,,,184,196,,,,,,,,,WOS:000088264300004,,,,,

The measurement of the risk of inadvertent dispersal of transgenes must include the assessment of accidental dispersion of pollen. Factors to be considered include the rate of pollen spread, the maximal dispersion distance of pollen, and the spatial dynamics of pollen movement within seed production fields; none of which are known for alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), an insect-pollinated crop species. Using a rare, naturally occurring molecular marker, alfalfa pollen movement was tracked from seed and hay production fields. Results indicated that leafcutter bees ((Megachile spp.) used in commercial seed production show a directional, non-random bias when pollinating within fields, primarily resulting in the movement of pollen directly towards and away from the bee domicile. Within-field pollen movement was detected only over distances of 4 m or less. Dispersal of pollen from alfalfa hay and seed production fields occurs at distances up to 1000 m. By examining widely dispersed, individual escaped alfalfa plants and their progeny using RAPD markers, gene movement among escaped alfalfa plants has been confirmed for distances up to 230 m. The outcrossing frequency for large fields was nearly 10-times greater than that of research-sized plots. A minimum isolation distance of 1557 m may be required to prevent gene flow in alfalfa. Data suggest that complete containment of transgenes within alfalfa seed or hay production fields would be highly unlikely using current production practices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0040-5752,,,,,JUL,2000,101,1-Feb,,,,,107,114,,10.1007/s001220051457,,,,,,,WOS:000088403800017,,,,,

The coefficient of variation had a strong effect on the strength of risk-sensitivity among studies with nectarivores, both invertebrates and vertebrates. The effect was not significant for studies with non-nectarivores, but these studies included only a Limited range of coefficients of variation, and risk-sensitivity in these studies was based on fewer subjects per experimental condition than in studies of nectarivores. The presence of empty rewards had no effect on the strength of risk-sensitivity. The apparent effect of empty rewards seems to be an artifact of the tendency of distributions that include zero rewards to have larger coefficients of variation than distributions that do not include zero rewards. I introduce the CV model, a simple descriptive model that accounts for a large proportion of the variability in levels of risk-sensitivity among experiments. My analysis reserves the apparent discrepancies among studies that report risk-sensitivity and risk-indifference. It is necessary to control for the magnitude of the coefficient of variation when testing risk-sensitivity under different conditions (e.g., energy budgets).

The nature of this correlation is determined by stamen and stigma length. Pollinators of G. palustre with short stamens and stigmas are smaller than those of Ch. anaugustfolium and G. pratense. On the Ether hand, more flexible pedicles of G. palustre prevent the flowers from visits of big insects. Three plants studied by the authors are not equally attactive for different insect groups.

But biologists can more easily study what an animal learns than how it learns. For example, honeybees take repeated 'orientation' flights before becoming foragers at about three weeks of age(1). These flights are a prerequisite for successful homing.(2) Little is known(2,3) about these flights because orienting bees rapidly fly out of the range of human observation. Using harmonic radar, we show for the first time a striking ontogeny to honeybee orientation flights. With increased experience, bees hold trip duration constant but fly faster, so later trips cover a larger area than earlier trips. In addition, each flight is typically restricted to a narrow sector around the hive. Orientation flights provide honeybees with repeated opportunities to view the hive and landscape features from different viewpoints, suggesting that bees learn the local landscape in a progressive fashion. We also show that these changes in orientation flight are related to the number of previous flights taken instead of chronological age, suggesting a learning process adapted to changes in weather conditions, flower availability and the needs of bee colonies.",,,,"Osborne, Juliet/I-6776-2012; Reynolds, Donald R/C-7361-2013; Poppy, Guy/D-7513-2012","Reynolds, Donald/0000-0001-8749-7491",,,,,,,,,,,,0028-0836,,,,,Feb-03,2000,403,6769,,,,,537,540,,10.1038/35000564,,,,,,,WOS:000085227300048,10676960,,,,

This: is especially true with hybrid seeds which could be produced using the two genetic male-sterility systems available. For two years, we studied the effectiveness of honey bees as pollinators to produce hybrid seeds of globe artichoke under insect-proof enclosures. We used two adjacent 10 x 6 m tunnels covered with 1-mm mesh screen and planted with 2 male-fertile (MF) and 7 male-sterile (MS) lines (Tab, 1). Each tunnel was provided with a colony of 3,500 bees at the onset of MF flowering. Flowering of MS and MF lines was well synchronized (Fig. 1), and the number of newer heads per plant was similar for all lines. Yet, there were over 10-fold differences in both years in the density of foragers that visited the various lines with extremes of 0.04 to 1.18 honey bees per head (Fig. 2). Some foragers collected pollen, but these were rarely seen on MS heads. The ranking of MS lines in terms of forager density was similar over both seasons, which suggests that die differences in attractiveness among these lines were of genetic origin and probably resulted from differences in nectar availability or composition. Yield of achenes per plant also varied significantly among lines (Fig. 3). The proportion of heads that were empty ranged from 23% Co 100% among MS lines, and for each season was negatively correlated with the average forager density on each line (Fig. 4). The number of achenes per head in the flower heads which were not empty did not vary significantly among MS Lines (Tab. II), which suggests that the pollination effectiveness of honey bee visits was similar among these different lines. This achene content was greater in MF heads, which is consistent with a greater pollination effectiveness of honey bees in this inflorescence due to the presence of pollen and some self-fertility in MF lines, The overall forager density was similar between the two seasons as was the proportion of empty MS heads, but the achene content of non-empty MS heads was significantly greater in the second year than in the first one (Tab. IT). This suggests that the pollination effectiveness of individual visits was greater in the second year. Pollen availability was similar in both seasons, but there were 5 rimes Fewer foragers collecting pollen in the second year compared to the first one.

My hypothesis is that the dance contains information about the ecological reality in which bees exist which has hitherto not been recognized and which is utilized by bees to maximize their foraging success. If a new, desirable source of food appears, other new locations of the same source are more than likely to soon appear.

The hypopharyngeal gland, which is well developed in young nursing bees to produce protein for larval food, was seen to regress naturally in foraging adult worker bees. A range of techniques including histology, cytochemistry, in situ TUNEL, Annexin V and Comet assays indicated that cells within the gland demonstrate progressive symptoms of apoptosis, necrosis and a vacuolar form of programmed cell death. The latter mode of cell death did not display chromatin margination, but was accompanied by an enhanced level of autophagic and hydrolytic activity in which a cytosolic source of acid phosphatase became manifest in the extra-cisternal spaces. Normal and annexin-positive cells were found to occur in the younger nursing bees, whilst necrosis and an aberrant vacuolar type of apoptosis predominated in the older foraging bees. The relevance of these results to the classification of programmed cell death is discussed.

Movements by bumblebees Bombus lapidarius were studied in arrays of plants of oil-seed rape Brassica napus cv Westar. In the arrays, plants were arranged into either a uniformly dispersed configuration or a patchily dispersed configuration. 2. Progress across an array was measured as the distance bumblebees had moved away from an original plant location after eight subsequent, successive plant visits. Movements were analysed in units of both metres and inter-plant spaces. In both units, bumblebees progressed more slowly across patchily dispersed arrays. 3. Plant dispersion had a detectable effect on certain components of bees' individual inter-plant moves (e.g. move length in metres) but not on others (e.g. mean turning angle). In some cases, the effects of aggregation on the components of individual moves were probably too small to detect statistically and only emerged in their cumulative effect on bees' progress. 4. Over short sequences of plant visits, bumblebees revisited plants rarely, but the frequency of revisits was almost twice as high in patchy arrays as in uniform arrays, and economic penalties may result from foraging among highly aggregated plants. 5. The effects of plant dispersion on pollinator movements detected in this study are unlikely to have a major impact on pollen transfer in B. napus because differences in pollinator progress only emerged after several successive inter-plant flights away from a potential pollen source, by which time the limited extent of pollen carryover in this species means that fertilisations from the source plant would be very rare.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,,,,,,2000,25,1,,,,,19,25,,10.1046/j.1365-2311.2000.00230.x,,,,,,,WOS:000085508700003,,,,,

This paper is an attempt to relate: the foraging ecology of this species to resource availability and to address several predictions of optimal foraging theory under natural conditions of seed harvesting. Spatial patterns of foraging trails tended to maximise acquisition of food resources, as trails led the ants to areas where seeds were more abundant locally, Moreover, harvesting activity concentrated an highly frequented trails, on which seeds were brought into the nest in larger numbers and more efficiently, at a higher mean rate per worker. The predictions of optimal foraging theory that ants should be more selective in both more resource-rich and more distant patches were tested in the native seed background. We confirm that selectivity of ants is positively related to trail length and thus to distance from the nest of foraged seeds. Conversely, we fail to find a consistent relationship between selectivity and density or species diversity of seed patches. We discuss how selectivity assessed at the colony level may depend on factors other than hitherto reported behavioural changes in seed choice by individual foragers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0020-1812,1420-9098,,,,,2000,47,1,,,,,56,62,,10.1007/s000400050009,,,,,,,WOS:000085847600009,,,,,

Little attention, however, has been given to floral traits, and almost no data have been collected on the effects of fire on pollinator activity and fruit-set. This paper reports the effects of fire on flower visitation rates and the possibly related fruit-set. We compared visitation rates of the main pollinators on four plant core-species in burned and adjacent unburned areas. Measurements were performed at an unburned phrygana (scrub lands), and at a burned area (5-7 years post-fire). Bumble bees and solitary bees were the main taxa of visitors, while few honeybees were recorded. Solitary bees were almost absent from the burned area. Fruit-set was significantly higher in the unburned area for three out of the four plant species. The lower fruit-set in the burned area was possibly the result of low activity of solitary bees which are the main effective pollinators of the examined species. We hypothesize that the populations of the solitary bees were diminished or extirpated either directly by the fire, or indirectly by the scarcity of nectar in the early post-fire years due to dominance of young pine and Cistus spp. seedlings.

The study was carried out in a fragmented rainforest landscape in north Queensland and movements were determined by radio-telemetry. Bars carried 6 times more pollen than birds, but were less frequent visitors to S. cormiflorum, suggesting that the quantity of pollen distributed by the two groups may not differ greatly. However. pollen quality (the geographic genetic distance moved) may be a more important factor in determining pollinator effectiveness. Bats were very mobile in the fragmented landscape, with home ranges varying from 12 to 1796 ha and often encompassing more than one forest fragment. Bats usually moved along strips of vegetation, but were found to fly; up to 5.8 km (mean = 1 km) across cleared land. This mobility led to similar numbers of S. australis being caught in small (< 50 ha) forest fragments and continuous forest. At the scale of individual trees, bats fed for an average of 1.2 min per tree, compared to 5.0 min for birds. Short foraging rimes per tree and frequent movements of > 200 m should increase the opportunity for movement of pollen between individual trees. Collectively, these observations suggest that S, australis carry pollen of high quality. Although they fly across cleared land, fragmentation may impact bat populations by allowing increased owl predation in open country and by increasing the reliance of bats on flower resources in the agricultural matrix. On the Atherton Tablelands, the latter is provided mostly by cultivated bananas (Musa sp.), which produce nectar but not pollen. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Male-sterile lines (Ogura CMS) secreted one-half to one-third the amount of their isogenic male-fertile counterparts. Restored lines behaved as conventional rape varieties.

The analysis of 'Samourai' winter oilseed rape showed that total sugar concentrations in nectar were highest at the beginning of the flowering period (30 g/100 ml) and lowest towards the end (10 g/100 ml). At a given date, total sugar contents in nectar of [0 +] varieties were significantly higher than those of[+ +] varieties and were due to higher fructose contents. Differences between genotypes within the same type also occurred, depending on the day of sampling. Oilseed rape nectar was confirmed to be predominantly composed of hexose (glucose and fructose).

Red and blue flowers both influenced long-distance attractiveness of plants, defined as the number of insect approaches towards an individual plant. After reaching a plant, flower visitors preferred to visit young red flowers. Therefore, short-distance attractiveness, defined as the number of flowers visited successively on an individual plant, was influenced mainly by the number of young red flowers. The co-occurrence of the change in reproductive ability, in amount of reward, and in flower color enabled lungwort plants to direct pollinators to reproductive, highly rewarding red flowers.

Loss of populations may negatively affect biotic interactions and ecosystem stability. Here we tested the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation affects bee populations and thereby disrupts plant-pollinator interactions. We experimentally established small ""habitat islands"" of two self-incompatible, annual crucifers on eight calcareous grasslands and in the intensively managed agricultural landscape at increasing distances (up to 1000 m) from these species-rich grasslands to measure effects of isolation on both pollinator guilds and seed set, independently from patch size and density, resource availability and genetic erosion of plant populations. Each habitat island consisted of four pots each with one plant of mustard (Sinapis arvensis) and radish (Raphanus sativus). Increasing isolation of the small habitat islands resulted in both decreased abundance and species richness of flower-visiting bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea). Mean body size of flower-visiting wild bees was larger on isolated than on nonisolated habitat islands emphasizing the positive correlation of body size and foraging distance. Abundance of flower-visiting honeybees depended on the distance from the nearest apiary. Abundance of other flower visitors such as hover flies did not change with increasing isolation. Number of seeds per fruit and per plant decreased significantly with increasing distance from the nearest grassland for both mustard and radish. Mean seed set per plant was halved at a distance of approximately 1000 m for mustard and at 250 m for radish. In accordance with expectations, seed set per plant was positively correlated with the number of flower-visiting bees. We found no evidence for resource limitation in the case of mustard and only marginal effects for radish.

The thermoregulatory capabilities of 18 species of Alaskan bees spanning nearly two orders of magnitude of body mass were measured. Thoracic temperature, measured across the temperature range at which each species forages, was regressed against operative (environmental) temperature to determine bees' abilities to maintain relatively constant thoracic temperatures across a range of operative temperatures (thermoregulatory performance). 2. Previous studies on insect thermoregulation have compared thoracic temperature with ambient air temperature. Operative temperature, which integrates air temperature, solar radiation and effects of wind, was estimated by measuring the temperature of a fresh, dead bee in the field environment. It is suggested that this is a more accurate measure of the thermal environment experienced by the insect and also allows direct comparisons of insects under different microclimate conditions, such as in sun and shade. 3. Simple regression analysis of species and family means, and analysis of phylogenetically based independent contrasts showed thermoregulatory capability, ability to elevate thoracic temperature, and minimum thoracic temperature necessary for initiating flight all increased with body size. 4. Bumble-bees were better thermoregulators than solitary bees primarily as a consequence of their larger body size. However, their thermoregulatory abilities were slightly, but significantly, better than predicted from body size alone, suggesting an added role of pelage and/or physiology.

In two subunits of the patch, differing in plant density, a larger number (P = 0.0026) of bees foraged in the high plant density unit, and a lower infloescence/bee ratio (P = 0.0367) was found there. The estimated total number of bees foraging at any one time in the two patch subunits differed significantly (5 out of 7 times, P < 0.01 or < 0.05) from the values expected if the bees were distributed in proportion to the number of inflorescences in each patch. Bees foraged within individual undefended and interlaced areas, and flight routes within these areas were maintained for up to at least 10 days. When part of their foraging area was screened by bagging some plants, the workers did not leave the patch, but most of them responded by visiting some adjacent plants or plant groups.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0394-9370,,,,,SEP,1999,11,3,,,,,243,264,,10.1080/08927014.1999.9522826,,,,,,,WOS:000082891700003,,,,,

Bumble bees play a vital role in the pollination of many crops and wild flowers, and plans for their conservation require a knowledge of the dynamics and spatial scale of their foraging flights, which are, at present, poorly understood. 2. We investigated the foraging range and constancy of two colonies of bumble bees Bombus terrestris L, on a mixed arable farm using harmonic radar, which has a unique capability to record the trajectories of insects flying at low altitude in the field. 3. Foraging bees were fitted with lightweight radar transponders and tracked as they flew to and from the nest to forage. The resulting tracks gave information on length, direction and straightness of foraging routes. Superimposition onto a map of the foraging landscape allowed interpretation of the bees' destinations in relation to the spatial distribution of forage. 4. Outward tracks had a mean length of 275.3 +/- 18.5 m (n = 65) and a range of 70-631 m, and were often to forage destinations beyond the nearest available forage. Most bees were constant to compass bearing and destination over successive trips, although one bee was tracked apparently switching between forage patches. Both outward and return tracks had a mean straightness ratio of 0.93 +/- 0.01 (n = 99). The bees' ground speeds ranged from 3.0 m s(-1) to 15.7 m s(-1) (n = 100) in a variety of wind conditions. 5. The results support the hypothesis that bumble bees do not necessarily forage close to their nest, and illustrate that studies on a landscape scale are required if we are to evaluate bee foraging ranges fully with respect to resource availability. Such evaluations are required to underpin assessments of gene flow in bee-pollinated crops and wild flowers. They are also required when making decisions about the management of bees as pollinators and the conservation of bee and plant biodiversity.",,,,"Reynolds, Donald R/C-7361-2013; Osborne, Juliet/I-6776-2012","Reynolds, Donald/0000-0001-8749-7491",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,AUG,1999,36,4,,,,,519,533,,10.1046/j.1365-2664.1999.00428.x,,,,,,,WOS:000082642300006,,,,,

The question of why this flower constancy exists is a rich and important one with implications for the organization of natural communities of plants, floral evolution, and our understanding of the learning processes involved in finding food. Some scientists have assumed that newer constancy is adaptive per se. Others argued that constancy occurs because memory capacity for floral features in insects is limited, but attempts to identify the limitations often remained rather simplistic. We elucidate now different sensory and motor memories from natural foraging tasks are stored and retrieved, using concepts from modern learning science and visual search, and conclude that newer constancy is likely to have multiple causes. Possible constraints favoring constancy are interference sensitivity of short-term memory, and temporal limitations on retrieving information from long-term memory as rapidly as from short-term memory, but further empirical evidence is needed to substantiate these possibilities. In addition, retrieving memories mall be slower and more prone to errors when there are several options than when an insect copes with only a single task. In addition to memory limitations, we also point out alternative explanations for newer constancy. We then consider the way in which floral parameters, such as interplant distances, nectar rewards, flower morphology, and floral color (as seen through bees' eyes) affect constancy. Finally, we discuss the implications of pollinator constancy for plant evolution. To date there is no evidence that flowers have diverged to favor constancy, although the appropriate tests may not have yet been conducted. However, there is good evidence against the notion that pollinator constancy is involved in speciation or maintenance of plant species integrity.",,,,"Chittka, Lars/C-3110-2012","Chittka, Lars/0000-0001-8153-1732",,,,,,,,,,,,0028-1042,,,,,AUG,1999,86,8,,,,,361,377,,10.1007/s001140050636,,,,,,,WOS:000082155200001,,,,,

This colony pattern was a result of the following individual behavioural decisions: continue foraging, abandon the feeder, restart foraging and initiate foraging. Only very rarely did individuals switch from one feeder to the other. With the first combination of a rich (2.7 M) and a poor (0.8 M) feeder M. fasciata behaved differently from Apis mellifera. Recruitment occurred to both feeders and the poor feeder was not abandoned completely. When the poor feeder was set to 0.4 M, M. fasciata abandoned the poor feeder rapidly and allocated more foragers to the rich feeder. These patterns were similar to those reported for A. mellifera with the first combination of feeders. Over a sequence of 4 days, experienced bees increasingly determined the colony patterns, and the major function of communication between workers became the reactivation of experienced foragers. The foragers modulated their behaviour not only according to the profitability of the feeder, but also according to previous experience with profitability switches. Thus, experience and communication together regulated colony foraging behaviour. These findings and the results of studies with honeybees suggest that M. fasciata and honeybees use similar decision-making mechanisms and only partly different tools.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,,,,,JUL,1999,46,2,,,,,129,140,,10.1007/s002650050602,,,,,,,WOS:000081634100008,,,,,

The behaviour of pairs of bees, one (donor) fed with 50-mu l sucrose solutions and another unfed recipient, was analysed as a function of the sucrose concentration, the concentration at constant viscosity (kept constant by adding tylose, an inert polysaccharide), and of the viscosity of a 30% sucrose solution. By increasing the concentration of solutions, the rate at which the solution was transferred to recipient bees (transfer rate of solution, in mu l/s) increased up to a maximum value for 30% sucrose solution, and decreased beyond this concentration (concentration experiment). At constant viscosity, no modulation was observed for the lower sugar concentration range (10-30%), while the transfer rate of solution clearly increased beyond 30% (concentration experiment at constant viscosity). For the 30% sucrose solution, the transfer rate decreased with increasing viscosity (viscosity experiment). If only the sucrose compound is comparatively analysed, the transfer rate of sucrose (in mg/s) increased similarly in the first two experiments. These results give behavioural evidence suggesting that donor bees are capable of modulating the trophallactic food transfer as related to the sucrose concentrations carried into their crops within a considerable wide range, but viscosity prevents it. It also suggests; that trophallactic transfer rate does not depend on abdominal volume, for even when all donor bees attained similar loads (50 mu l), transfer rate of solution increased along with the offered sucrose concentration.

We examined factors influencing pollen limitation in Rhexia virginica (Melastomataceae), a species in which pollen transfer depends on bumblebees capable of buzz pollination. Experimental studies were conducted in two populations at Lake Matchedash, southern Ontario, Canada, where the species occurs at the edge of its familial range. 2 Supplemental hand pollination of flowers increased their probability of fruit set compared with open-pollinated control flowers by an average of 57.6%. Pollen limitation was assessed on a per flower basis because the median floral display size at Lake Matchedash was one flower. Pollen limitation was prevalent throughout the 3-4-week blooming period in one population, whereas in the other it was only evident at the beginning of flowering, despite their close proximity. 3 Bumblebee visits (primarily Bombus impatients) to R. virginica flowers were infrequent and variable in their occurrence. Visitation was recorded on 14 days during flowering. The median number of visits was 0.65 bees per hour; on 6 days there was virtually no bee activity, but on 2 days visitation rates were high. Variation in pollinator activity was apparently unrelated to local weather conditions. 4 Field experiments demonstrated that the poricidal anthers of R. virginica dispense pollen gradually, with only 10.2% of pollen removed from flowers during a single bumblebee visit. This level of pollen removal is lower than reported in other flowering plants. On average, 47.3% of pollen remained in anthers at the end of anthesis. 5 Investigation of the relation between pollen dispersal and pollen limitation demonstrated a significant negative correlation between the proportion of pollen removed from anthers on a given day and the intensity of pollen limitation. It appears that the pollen-dispensing mechanism of R. virginica and infrequent visitation by bumblebees compromise pollen dispersal, causing pollen limitation in Ontario populations.",,,,"Barrett, Spencer CH/M-3751-2013; Barrett, Spencer C.H./S-5782-2019","Barrett, Spencer C.H./0000-0002-7762-3455",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,JUN,1999,87,3,,,,,371,381,,10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00362.x,,,,,,,WOS:000081304700001,,,,,

The study was carried out in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada, Spain, over four years (1988-1991). We selected three populations of H. spinosa located along a wide altitudinal gradient. This plant species was visited during the four years of the study by at least 70 species of insects belonging to five orders and 19 families. The assemblage of floral visitors of H. spinosa was composed mainly of ants and different species of solitary bees and flies, although most pollinators were comparatively rare. There were striking similarities between most pollinator species in the distributions of flight distance between consecutive flowers, which were leptokurtic and highly skewed. Moreover, almost all visitors acted as pollinators, depositing pollen grains enough for seed production. Insects visiting flowers of H. spinosa can be divided into two guilds: nectarivores (small flies and ants) and pollinivores (bees and hoverflies), which differ in pollination attributes. Flower-visitation rates were quite different between the faster pollinivores and the slower nectarivores. All nectarivorous species moved almost exclusively between flowers of the same plant, whereas pollinivores sometimes moved between plants; and pollinivores deposited more pollen grains per visit than did nectarivores. H. spinosa interacted most frequently with the nectarivorous Proformica longiseta, Fannia scalaris, and Exechia dorsalis in the two lowest elevation populations of Sierra Nevada, and with the pollinivorous Colletes sp. and Eristalis tenax in the highest elevation population. The mutualistic interaction between H. spinosa and its pollinators is a generalized system, where the traits of the flower allow almost every floral visitor to act as a true, effective, pollinator. The lack of differences in per-visit pollination effectiveness and the functional equivalence of very different pollinators may help to maintain this generalized system.",,,,"Gomez, Jose/K-8061-2017","Zamora Rodriguez, Regino/0000-0002-5049-9968",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,APR,1999,80,3,,,,,796,805,,10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0796:GVSITP]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,WOS:000082154300006,,,,,

These changes are rapidly induced by pollination, but will also occur much more slowly without pollination. Orange flowers typically lack nectar and pollen. We examined the reproductive success of these plants to test the hypothesis that retention of orange flowers increases pollinator visitation rate and fruit set while reducing costs to the pollinators. All of the common species of bee pollinators that visited deer weed easily distinguished between yellow and orange flowers at close range and preferentially probed yellow flowers. Retention of orange flowers by these plants resulted in a higher frequency of pollinator visits and a higher fruit set per flower than plants that lacked orange flowers. The number of flowers visited by each pollinator was lower on plants with a mixture of yellow and orange flowers, suggesting that the presence of orange flowers may reduce selfing.

The return path pattern was characterized by a nearly linear oriented-to-the-goal trajectory, an arrest, and a systematic search at a much slower speed. The arrest position indicated that the insect's home vector was back to zero and that it was the estimated shelter position. If the shelter failed to be at the arrest position, cockroaches started a nonrandom systematic search directed mainly around the arrest.

Artificially immobilised bees consumed more oxygen (averages: 7.4 and 6.9 mu l O-2.min(-1) at 25 degrees and 35 degrees C, respectively) than spontaneously motionless bees but less than active, freely moving individuals. Oxygen measurements in immobilised honeybees, therefore, are neither suited to determine the basal rate of oxygen metabolism nor to estimate the energy turnover of highly active, freely moving individuals. As was expected from thermographical temperature measurements, oxygen consumption by bees which were free to move within 95 mi Warburg vessels varied in a wide range. At an ambient temperature of 25 degrees C it followed a bimodal distribution, with one peak below 20 and a second peak between 70-130 mu l O-2.min(-1). At 35 degrees C oxygen consumption was always below 75 mu l O-2.min(-1). However, considering the bees' level of activity led to a clear reduction of variability of data. Spontaneously motionless bees consumed on average 3.2 and 4.3 mu l O-2.min(-1) at 25 degrees and 35 degrees C, respectively. In active bees the oxygen consumption rate was higher and related to the degree of activity and ambient temperature. Moderately active individuals consumed 48.4 mu l O-2.min(-1) at 25 degrees C and 18.3 mu l O-2.min(-1) at 35 degrees C. By contrast, fast walking bees had significantly higher oxygen consumption rates: 91.4 and 30.5 mu l O-2.min(-1) at 25 degrees and 35 degrees C, respectively. Since running speed of the active bees was not distinguishable by eye and the distribution of observed behaviours was identical at 25 and 35 degrees C but oxygen consumption was 2.64-3.15 times higher at 25 degrees C, it can be concluded that more energy is invested in thermoregulation than in motion at both ambient temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8177,,,,,,1999,24,1,,,,,1,12,,,,,,,,,WOS:000081456700001,,,,,

Median distances between synchronized flowering trees were 600 to 1000 m depending on the time of the flowering season. The number of synchronous flowering trees at each observation date in the 400-ha plot was 14 or 17.5 per 1 d, 13 (both) per 15 d, and three or 13 per 30 d, depending upon which of the two methods was used to evaluate synchrony. Fifty percent of the flowering trees overlapped in flowering with six to seven other flowering trees growing within a radius of 1000 m during most of the annual flowering period. Outcrossing rates were 100 % and the relatively long distances between trees in flower at the same time, support the assumption that this species is pollinated by pollinators travelling distances as far as 1000 m.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0266-4674,,,,,JAN,1999,15,,1,,,,97,121,,10.1017/S0266467499000693,,,,,,,WOS:000079635000006,,,,,

However, prior research has focused on species that can accurately communicate food location. Little is known about species with a weak ability to communicate food location. We therefore examined the spatial communication abilities of a putatively primitive stingless bee, Trigona carbonaria. We trained foragers to one feeder (the experimental feeder) and set out an array of identical control feeders to test the communication of direction and distance. Recruits could find the food source at the correct direction, but this was influenced by orientation to food odor and a favorable wind direction. In trials with scented feeders, significantly more newcomers (71%) arrived in the correct direction when the experimental feeder was directly upwind from the nest. When the experimental feeder was downwind from the nest, a non-significant majority of newcomers (51%) arrived at the experimental feeder. However, orientation to food odor is not essential, since significantly more newcomers arrived at the experimental feeder in the unscented direction trial with rapid recruitment (50 new-comers/hours, 195 forager visits per hour). Experienced foragers did not appear to communicate distance because newcomers (61%) generally preferred the closest feeder to the nest, even in the unscented distance experiments. Overall, our results suggest that recruits can orient to the scent of the food source and may also orient to a forager-deposited pheromone at the food source or follow experienced foragers for part of the distance to the food source.",,,,"Spaethe, Johannes/B-8826-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,0944-2006,,,,,,1999,102,4,,,,,238,246,,,,,,,,,WOS:000086162100006,,,,,

Here we examine the ability of honeybees to gauge distance travelled when visual input is available primarily to one eye. Bees were trained to fly into a tunnel, lined with textured patterns, to collect a reward at a feeder placed at a certain distance. Their ability to estimate distance flown was then assessed by testing them in ai fresh tunnel without the feeder. The results show that (1) bees can estimate distance flown under monocular conditions, performing nearly as accurately as when information is available to both eyes; (2) bees can learn to fly two: different distances, where each distance is measured in terms of the image motion experienced by a different eye; and (3) bees that have acquired. information on the distance to a food source using one eye can measure out the same distance when they are required to use the other (naive) eye. The need to measure distance using signals from a single eye becomes important when a bee flies to a food source along the face of a cliff or the edge of a forest. Furthermore, under such conditions, it is important to be able to deal with odometric signals that are transposed interocularly when the bee returns home from the food source. This is because, although distances are learnt primarily-bn the way to a food source, foraging bees monitor distance flown on the homebound as well as' the outbound routes.

When tested against a null distribution using a randomization model, the observed pattern of arrivals for the whole group of bees was random, but departures were clustered in time. Certain individuals visited the plant repeatedly and frequently throughout the day. These showed significantly regular arrival and departure schedules, which were likely produced by traplining. We explored whether these more frequent and regular foragers gained a higher reward than random or incidental plant visitors. Using an analytical model, Possingham predicted that a dominating forager that visited a simple, renewing resource in a regular pattern would garner higher and less variable rewards than random visitors. Inspired by these results, but interested in plant-level visitation, we constructed a simulation model of resource dynamics for a multiflowered plant with high visitation. The model incorporates the observed visitation schedules of all bees and independent reward dynamics for each flower on the plant. We calculated the rewards that observed bees would have collected given a range of resource-renewal parameters. More frequent visitors did not return to the plant when whole-plant resource levels were higher, but these visitors did get greater rewards. Their increased reward resulted from greater foraging efficiency, primarily through selecting (on average) more rewarding flowers than those selected by less frequent, random visitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045-2249,,,,,NOV-DEC,1998,9,6,,,,,612,621,,10.1093/beheco/9.6.612,,,,,,,WOS:000078631200011,,,,,

To determine if the bees communicate location information inside or outside the nest, we conducted removal experiments by training marked foragers to one of two identical feeders and then separating these experienced foragers from potential recruits as they left the nest. The feeders were positioned to test the communication of each dimension. The results show that recruits do not simply follow experienced foragers to the food source. Height and distance are communicated within the nest, while direction is communicated outside the nest. We then examined the pulsed sounds produced by recruiting foragers. While unloading food, recruiting foragers produced several short pulses and one or more very long pulses. On average, the longest unloading pulse per performance was 31-50% longer (P less than or equal to 0.018) for bees foraging on the forest floor than for bees foraging at the top of the forest canopy (40 m high). While dancing, recruiting foragers produced sound pulses whose duration was positively correlated with the distance to the food source (P < 0.001). Dancing recruiters also produced several short sound pulses followed by one or more long pulses. The longest dance pulse per performance was 291 +/- 194 ms for a feeder 25 m from the nest and 1858 +/- 923 ms for a feeder 360 m away from the nest. The mechanism of directional communication remains a mystery. However, the direction removal experiment demonstrates that newcomers cannot use forager-deposited scent marks for long-distance orientation (>100 m from the nest).",,,,"Nieh, James/H-8705-2014","Nieh, James/0000-0001-6237-0726",,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,,,,,NOV,1998,43,6,,,,,387,399,,10.1007/s002650050506,,,,,,,WOS:000076383400006,,,,,

The 2 variables are correlated, but also displayed significant spatial patterns, as detected by trend surface and spatial autocorrelation analyses. After removing these spatial effects, worker body size and geographic range size were still positively correlated. The relationship, therefore, is not a consequence of spatial effects and it does follow Brown's model, which predicts that the geographic range size will have a positive slope on body size. In this model, the lower population densities caused by foraging activities and local territorial competition are associated with a large geographic range, avoiding stochastic extinction.

In addition, we examine the role the pollination system plays in determining the reproductive success of the male steriles. Seventeen populations in Maryland, Illinois, and Kansas were surveyed and found to range from 0 to 6% male sterility per population. An artificial population of male-sterile simulants and hermaphrodites was created to examine how the local frequency of nonrewarding male steriles might affect male-sterile female reproductive success. Male steriles performed equally poorly, with respect to seed production, whether surrounded by other male-sterile simulants or hermaphrodites. Compensation was examined by comparison of male steriles and hermaphrodites with respect to several reproductive and nonreproductive characters. Male steriles outperformed hermaphrodites in terms of nonreproductive biomass, but performed equally in terms of ovule number and produced many fewer flowers. The genetic basis of male sterility was examined by performing both intra- and interpopulational crosses of male steriles to hermaphrodites and indicate that male sterility is not purely cytoplasmic.

We show that most existing approaches to scene-based homing implicitly assume an isotropic landmark distribution. As an alternative, we propose a homing scheme that uses parameterized displacement fields. These are obtained from an approximation that incorporates prior knowledge about perspective distortions of the visual environment. A mathematical analysis proves that both approximations do not prevent the schemes from approaching the goal with arbitrary accuracy, but lead to different errors in the computed goal direction.

In the species studied here (Uca lactea annulipes, Uca vomeris) a crab normally wanders no more than about 1 m away from its burrow and, when frightened, dashes back along a straight line to take cover. Feeding crabs tend to move sideways, without changing orientation, along paths radiating from the burrow. When they move along circumferential paths they adjust their orientation so that one side continues to point towards the burrow. The crabs do not need to see the burrow in order to stay aligned with the home vector, and they are not misled by a dummy hole close to their own burrow unless they have come to within about 10 cm of it. The home runs of crabs end within a few centimeters of a burrow that is covered with a sheet of sandpaper and then give way to search runs, centred upon a position slightly short of the burrow location. Feeding crabs can be displaced on sandpapers and their subsequent home runs end at a position where the burrow would be, had there been no displacement.

The locations were similar except in disturbance history, which was reflected in decreasing tree density from undisturbed via moderately disturbed to disturbed sites. 2 Hand pollination experiments showed S. siamensis to be partially self-incompatible due to differential pollen tube growth and abortion of inbred fruit. Although more than 90% of flowers from trees at all sites were pollinated, pollen tubes developed in only a small proportion of these flowers. Both pollen tube development and initial fruit production were highest at the undisturbed site. Many fruit, presumably selfed, were aborted during development at all sites, but significantly more fruit were aborted at the disturbed site, resulting in lowered production of mature fruit. 3 Shorea siamensis was pollinated by small Trigona bees, which exhibited significant declines in intertree movements with increasing distance between flowering trees. As resource availability did not differ between sites, differences in mature fruit set were considered to be mediated by changes in pollinator foraging behaviour at differing tree densities. Variation in seed set was found to be negatively correlated with distance to nearest conspecific both within and between sites. 4 At the two least disturbed sites observed seed set values corresponded with those expected by calculation. However, seed set at the disturbed site was significantly lower than expected. 5 Our results suggest that high reproductive success of S. siamensis is dependent upon cross-pollination which, through pollinator behaviour, is a function of tree isolation. This species may thus be subject to the Allee effect, where population viability is reduced disproportionately with a decline in population size or, as in this study, population density.

Consequently, under strong-wind conditions, up to 100% of the bees travelled to the adjacent upwind row in a 10-min period. The percentage of cross-pollinating bees decreased with increasing,distance from the pollen source, following a hyperbolic curve, and reached 1-2% of the bees at a distance of 10-15 rows.

We test whether constancy occurs in an overlooked group of pollinators, the syrphid flies. Foraging sequences of wild flies of two species, Episyrphus balteatus and Syrphus ribesii, were examined when visiting flowers in seminatural plant communities and in artificial arrays of two color morphs of Lobularia maritima planted at a range of frequencies. Both species exhibited marked floral constancy when foraging in the mixed-plant community. Because all groups of pollinating insect so far examined exhibit constancy at least under some circumstances, we suggest that this is the predominant strategy used by pollinators and that there is probably a common explanation. Neither syrphid species exhibited constancy to different color morphs within a plant species, in contrast to previously published studies of Hymenoptera foraging among polymorphic flowers, which all describe positive frequency-dependent selection. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. We argue that constancy in these syrphids is unlikely to result from learning constraints on handling ability, currently the most widely accepted explanation for flower constancy, because they forage primarily for pollen which is easily located in most flowers they visit.",,,,"Goulson, David/A-2462-2010","Goulson, David/0000-0003-4421-2876",,,,,,,,,,,,1045-2249,,,,,MAY-JUN,1998,9,3,,,,,213,219,,10.1093/beheco/9.3.213,,,,,,,WOS:000074092300003,,,,,

Homing rates and the proportion of individuals returning on the day of release declined with distance, implying that homing from greater distances is not based solely on the use of landmarks. A long duration of return (often not on the same day) and high efficiency of homing (four bees out of 10 returned from a 4 km distance over the lake), as well as an increase in average return speed approximate to 10 m/min) with distance of bees homing on the same day suggest that homing is also not based upon radial scatter as the sole lactic. This is supported by the observation that the initial orientations of the bees were not equally probable. Departures towards the sun greatly exceeded those away from the sun and the bees also tended to depart in cardinal geographical (or geomagnetic) directions, preferring meridional directions (especially southward) to parallel ones (of which east was preferred). Departure directions did not depend on wind direction but did depend, to some extent, on the landscape features of release sites.

Aspects of the flowering biology of wild cashew Anacardium occidentale, an andromonoecious, self-fertile tree, were studied in the north-east of Brazil, where this species is endemic. Comparison was made among two bee species, Apis mellifera and Centris tarsata, in their pollination of cashew flowers using a number of measures including single bee visits to marked flowers. 2. Cashew flowering is protandrous within a day. Male flowers greatly outnumber hermaphrodite flowers. Stigmas lose receptivity rapidly and pollen is quickly removed from anthers yet flowers remain intact for several days. 3. Only females of C. tarsata collected pollen from cashew flowers, and then only from male flowers. The similar foraging behaviour of the nectar collectors of the two bet species under investigation when visiting hermaphrodite cashew flowers suggests that they may both act as good pollinators. 4. We develop an index of efficiency of pollen removal from anthers (PREi) whereby the relative benefits of flower visitors to a component of a plant's male reproductive success can be quantified. 5. Comparisons of single bee visits to flowers with unvisited flowers and others receiving unlimited visits were used to show that: C. tarsata pollen collectors were more efficient than nectar collectors of either bee species at removing pollen from anthers: nectar collectors of both bee species had similar pollen removal efficiencies; C. tarsata was more efficient at depositing pollen on stigmas than A. mellifera; both bee species had statistically similar efficiencies at setting seed. 6. The indices of efficiency for some of the stages in the pollination of cashew suggest that C. tarsata flower visits may enhance plant reproductive success over flower visits by A. mellifera but that both bee species may be suitable for the pollination of commercially grown cashew. 7.

We compare predictions for solitary and social provisioners, and for three foraging currencies. When distinct food patches with identical food parameters are considered, fewer provisioners use the farther patches. The rate of decline in number of provisioners depends on the currency used. With net rate of energy intake (net energy gain over time), the rate of decline is relatively small under a wide range of realistic parameter values and distances; with efficiency (net energy gain over energy cost) and empirically derived energetic costs, the rate of decline is much higher. With lifetime fitness (lifetime food delivery under predation risk), outcomes depend on the ratio of mortality risk during flight and during food collection at the patch. With all currencies, there is a difference between the optimal spatial distribution of solitary and social provisioners, with a larger proportion of social provisioners being farther from the central place. The optimal distribution of solitary provisioners in a two dimensional field of uniformly distributed food such as a flowering meadow is such that the density of solitary provisioners (number per unit area) declines monotonically with distance, and provisioner number peaks at half the maximum area used.

The transmission rate of this disease therefore depends on spore deposition by the vector species and preferences for infected vs. healthy hosts. We observed natural populations of S. alba to document the most abundant insect visitors, which include syrphid flies, andrenid bees, bumblebees and a variety of nocturnal moths. Using bumblebees and moths in flower preference studies, we showed that bumblebees preferentially visited healthy flowers, but the strength of this preference declined if the bees had prior exposure to diseased flowers. Nocturnal moths showed less discrimination with respect to disease status when plants were arranged in a field population of S. alba, and preferentially visited plants with more flowers. A laboratory analysis of spore deposition by bumblebees showed that whereas most spores were deposited on the first several flowers visited, flowers beyond the 15th visit may still receive enough spores to produce a new infection. Spore deposition was also influenced by changes in vector behavior associated with spacing in artificial arrays of S. alba plants. Models were fitted to deposition data to compare estimates for spore dispersal rates and the initial number of spores acquired by vectors. This study demonstrated several ways that vector behavior can influence rates of disease spread in natural populations. Preferences for healthy vs. infected hosts can cause disease dispersal to vary from that expected by randomly foraging insect vectors.

Blandly Densiflorus, Hebea, Heterocolon, Homoglossum, Linearifolius, Ophiolyza) show that 42 species are pollinated largely by polylectic bees in the family Apidae, 2 species by bees of the families Andrenidae or Halictidae, and 1 by a combination of hopliine beetles (Scarabaeidae) and Andrenidae. The floral phenology attractants, diversity of floral foragers, and sometimes the rewards, vary according to geography and are not correlated with taxonomy. Flowering in most Gladiolus species in the southern African winter-rainfall zone coincides with the end of the wet season, August to October, but a few flower from February to April at the end of the dry season. They have sweetly fragrant flowers with a wide range of colors and markings. These species receive a diversity of floral foragers including bees in the genera Allodape, Amegilla, Andrena, Anthophora, Apis, and Pachymelus. Most Gladiolus species of the summer-rainfall zone flower from December to April, from the middle to the end of the wet season, but a few species bloom from August to November, at the end of the dry season. Their flowers have no discernible fragrance and are colored mostly in shades of pink to mauve or white. Most floral foragers collected on these species were bees in the genus Amegilla, but other bee genera, as well as flies in the genera Prosoeca and Stenobasipteron, were captured. Among the southern African species of Gladiolus pollinated by bees, there are two distinct pollination strategies. The majority have bilabiate, ""gullet"" flowers or ""flag"" flowers that secrete sucrose-rich nectar at the base of an obliquely funnel-shaped floral tube 9-20 mm long with the loner, narrow part 5-15 mm long. Apis mellifera and large-bodied anthophorine bees (especially Amegilla and Anthophora) contact dehiscent anthers and/or receptive stigmas while probing the tube for nectar with elongated probosces. In contrast, G. brevitubus, G. quadrangularis, and G. stellatus have rotate, actinomorphic (or subactinomorphic) perianths offering little or no nectar at the base of tubes less than 7 mm long. Andrena species or Apis mellifera contact both dehiscent anthers and receptive stigmas of G. stellatus or G. quadrangularis, respectively, while foraging for pollen. An additional 53 Gladiolus species also have bilabiate, gullet or flag flowers with obliquely funnel-shaped tubes 9-20 mm long (the most common flower type in the genus), and are presumed also to be adopted for pollination by long-tongued anthophorine and honey bees. The actinomorphic, rotate floral form is present in 2 more species. Thus, 60% of the Gladiolus species in southern Africa may be regarded as being pollinated by Lees, and the overwhelming majority of these species (95%) have gullet or flag flowers and are visited primarily by long-tongued anthophorine bees that are foraging for nectar. The remaining species of Gladiolus in southern Africa have flowers with elongate perianth tubes and are adapted for pollination by sunbirds or insects other than bees, most importantly long-tongued flies (Nemestrinidae, Tabanidae), moths, and the large satyrid butterfly, Aeropetes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0026-6493,,,,,,1998,85,3,,,,,492,517,,10.2307/2992045,,,,,,,WOS:000077237900007,,,,,

Burrow architecture differed specifically, Diets were qualitatively similar at insect family level but different at the species level, partly because of local variation in availability and partly because of distinct preferences of M. apiaster for small beetles, ants and termites and of NI, persicus for large dragonflies and cicadas. Merops persicus was less specialized than M. apiaster and had an airborne insect prey spectrum nearly twice as broad. Diets were more alike where the two birds foraged together than where they foraged separately, There was a high incidence of egg and nestling loss by predation and starvation.

The mean nearest-neighbour distance was the same in both arrays, as was the general hexagonal appearance. The experiment therefore compares how resource dispersion, independent of nearest-neighbour distance, influences bee behaviour. Bees in the variable array showed decreased directionality, higher revisitation frequencies, and greater inter-flower flight distances than shown in the constant array. As a consequence, bees in the variable array had a 19% lower gross rate of nectar collection.

Allele frequencies were significantly different among sites, and estimated F-ST indicated moderate genetic differentiation (theta = 0.062).

Individually labeled undertakers, guards, food storers, and wax workers exhibited a broad range of task-related behavior, but bees tagged as undertakers were more likely to subsequently remove a corpse from the hive and handle a corpse compared to other middle-aged bees. The activity level of undertakers was similar to other task groups, suggesting that undertaking specialists were neither hyper-active ''elites'' nor quiescent ''reserves'' that become active only when a dead bee stimulus is present. Undertakers also were more likely to remove debris and to remain in the lower region of the hive or near the entrance, even when not engaged in corpse removal; both preferences may promote colony efficiency by reducing inter-task travel times. Guards and undertakers were less likely to perform behavior normally associated with young bees compared to food storers and wax workers. Undertakers and guards also initiated foraging at earlier ages than the other task groups. These results suggest that undertakers and guards may be slightly developmentally advanced compared to food storers and wax workers. There also was evidence for lifetime differences in behavioral preferences which could not be explained by differences in adult development. Bees tagged as undertakers were more likely to subsequently remove a dead bee during their entire pre-foraging career compared to other task groups or members of their general age cohort. Differences in both the rate of adult development and individual behavioral preferences, both of which may be subject to genetic and environmental influences, are important determinants of inter-individual variation among honey bees of middle age.",,,,"Huang, Zachary/D-5485-2011","Huang, Zachary/0000-0001-5354-5547; Trumbo, Stephen/0000-0002-4455-4211",,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,1432-0762,,,,SEP,1997,41,3,,,,,151,163,,10.1007/s002650050374,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XY71100002,,,,,

For each flower visited, the choice was either to travel straight ahead onto a flower in the same row or to change direction and choose a flower in the other row. The distance between rows was manipulated to be smaller than, equal to, or greater than the distance between flowers in the same row. When the distances between adjacent flowers within a row and between rows were equal, a significant tendency to travel straight ahead was observed. This tendency was sensitive to changes in distance between rows, even when the distances between rows far exceeded the distance between flowers within a row. The tendency was abolished when the distance between rows was smaller than the distance between flowers within a row. A significant alternation of the bumble bee between rows (zigzag path) was observed in only one condition: when not only the distance between rows was much smaller than the distance between flowers in the same row, but also when the rows were staggered such that the bee could alternate between rows while still travelling in an almost straight line. These results show that the two variables of distance and angle are integrated, and that the choices made by bumble bees do not reflect a simple rule.

There was a broad range of capture intervals (the time required for the parent to capture a single prey) when the flight speeds predicted by the three currencies were so high that they resulted in daily provisioning costs which parents could not fully recover through self-feeding. Whenever the efficiency currency produced higher estimates of reproductive success, parents lost comparatively less weight than when they foraged as rate-maximizers. If parents did not experience any weight loss, the net rate and efficiency currencies made equivalent fitness projections. However, both of these currencies provided lower fitness returns than daily delivery rate at longer capture intervals. There were a number of capture intervals when estimates of reproductive success from the state variable model and at least one of the foraging currencies were equal. Provisioning behaviour under the state variable model was much more flexible and parents were therefore able to reduce their self-feeding rate on days when food was particularly scarce, thereby increasing the total delivery to the nest. This resulted in higher fitness returns than was possible under the foraging currencies. Our results suggest that efficiency-maximizing is more likely to provide fitness returns that are equivalent to the state variable model in comparison with the rate-maximizing alternatives, Furthermore, only the efficiency currency and the state variable model made predictions of flight speed that were similar to speeds measured in black tern parents provisioning young at natural nests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-7653,,,,,JUL,1997,11,4,,,,,399,417,,10.1023/A:1018480723094,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XP50200002,,,,,

To tackle this question, we recorded handling times and flight times from bees foraging in a natural meadow containing five plant species. Inter- and intra-specific plant distances were quantified. The bee-subjective colors of the five species were determined; two of these species had similar colors and structures, while three species were distinct from all others. The following rules were identified: (1) The decision to switch species was correlated with previous flower handling time, which we assume is a function of the reward amount received at the flower. After short handling times, the probability of switching to another species increased, whereas it decreased after long handling times. This difference became even greater if the bee bad had a run of several short or several long handling times. (2) Constant flights (those between flowers of the same species) and transition flights (those between flowers of different species) followed stereotyped temporal patterns independent of the distances between flowers. Constant flights within five plant species consistently had median durations of about 2 seconds, whereas median transition times between species took 3-6 seconds. (3) This temporal rule broke down, however, if the flowers of two case transition flights had equal dynamics as constant flights. (4) Bees switched more frequently from rare than from common species but even more frequently between similar species. We conclude that the bees' choices were determined by a set of rules that guided them to stay with the current plant species as long as flowers were rewarding and available within close distance but to switch to another species if flowers offered low rewards encountered at close range.",,,,"Chittka, Lars/C-3110-2012","Chittka, Lars/0000-0001-8153-1732",,,,,,,,,,,,1045-2249,,,,,MAY-JUN,1997,8,3,,,,,239,249,,10.1093/beheco/8.3.239,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XB63800002,,,,,

In the greenhouse, plants grown under low water or low light conditions produced approximately 25% less nectar on average than those grown under control conditions. However, significant genotype-environment interactions indicated that genets differed in their responses to the changes in conditions. Rank correlations for genet mean nectar production rates across environmental conditions were low, and in two out of three comparisons were not different from zero.

Population subdivision was evident from cluster analysis, and an analysis of genetic distances showed that there was significant genetic differentiation between all subpopulations.

To investigate this apparent contradiction further. I manipulated the levels of aggregation in linear plant arrays and examined both the effect on the movements of the bumblebee pollinators and the likely consequences for pollen dispersal and gene flow. I studied pollinator movements among plants of oil-seed rape (Brassica napus cv. Westar) that were arranged in rows that each contained 50 plants. In each experiment one row of plants was spaced at uniform intervals and the remaining rows contained aggregated plant distributions. Experiments were conducted at two scales, short rows (10 m) and long rows (20 m). The plants were visited almost exclusively by worker caste individuals of Bombus lapidarius. Bumblebees were followed over successive visits within a row and the location of each visited plant and the number of flowers probed there was recorded. Within each row, I examined the following components of bumblebee behaviour: the mean number of flowers probed per plant visit; the mean interplant flight distance; and the mean directionality (proportion of moves in an individual's favoured direction). The collective movements of bumblebees within each row were characterised by the rate of change of the bees' mean squared distance from an original location. The spatial dispersion of pollen from a paternal plant was estimated in each row by combining a quantitative description of bumblebee movements in terms of displacement from a paternal plant with a model of pollen deposition. Bumblebees were observed to visit many plants successively within a row and movements between rows were infrequent. In both long and short rows, three components of bumblebee movement behaviour were significantly modified by the level of plant aggregation. With increasing plant aggregation, bumblebees exhibited a decrease in directionality and in the number of flowers probed per plant visit and they exhibited an increase in the number of plants by-passed during interplant flights. Despite the effects of plant aggregation on the components of bumblebee behaviour, the bumblebees' collective rate of movement away from an origin within a row was unrelated to the level of plant aggregation. This was consistent with the finding that plant aggregation did not significantly affect either the estimates of mean pollen dispersal distances measured in metres or a plant's expected number of female mates. The modifications to bumblebee behaviour that were caused by differential aggregation among rows apparently combined, fortuitously, to buffer the spatial extent of pollen dispersal. Consequently, my results are consistent with Manasse's finding that pollinator-mediated gene flow was unrelated to plant spatial heterogeneity at these scales. However, I also conclude that the effects of plant aggregation on gene flow will depend on the spatial scale of the inter-patch distances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,,,,,APR,1997,78,3,,,,,546,556,,10.2307/3545616,,,,,,,WOS:A1997WU94100014,,,,,

Experiments were conducted on arrays of varying morph frequencies and at three different total flower densities. Bumblebees consistently shelved a preference for the commonest colour morph, and this behaviour was not significantly affected by changing density. In contrast, frequency-independent preferences changed significantly with density. At low densities, there was a strong bias towards the more conspicuous colour, whereas at higher densities there was no overall colour bias. Flight distances between flowers decreased significantly at high density. Bumblebees also visited flowers of similar colours sequentially, but this behaviour was not density-dependent. It is suggested that as densities increase, there is an increased probability that bumblebees detect yellow flowers, which were probably less conspicuous compared xith blue flowers, and that this might be caused by changes in flight speed with flight distance. Where there is a positive relationship between pollinator visitation and the relative fitness of a floral morph, the observed behaviour would induce positive frequency-dependent selection on a plant population with two corolla colour morphs on which the bumblebees were foraging, which would result in stabilizing selection for a single corolla colour, irrespective of density. There was no indication that rare colour morphs would be preferred at high density. The probability of different corolla colour morphs going to fixation would, however, be affected by density.

We examined the propensity of mites to leave their hosts and to move onto new bee hosts. We also examined their preference for bees of different age and hive function. Mites were standardized by selecting mites from newly emerged worker bees (NEWs). In closed jars, 50% of Varroa left NEWs irreversibly when no physical path was present for the mites to return to the NEWs; about 90% of mites left newly emerged drones in identical assays. In petri dish arenas, mites were rarely seen off NEW hosts when monitored at 15-min intervals for 4 h; this was the case for single NEWs with one mite (NEWs+) and when a NEW+ and a NEW- (no mites) were placed together in a petri dish. When a NEW+ was held with either a nurse bee or a pollen forager, 25% of the mites moved to the older bees. When both a nurse and a pollen forager were placed in a petri dish with a NEW+, about 50% of the mites transferred to older bees; nurse bees received about 80% of these mites, whereas pollen foragers received significantly fewer mites (about 20%, P < 0.05). Most mite transfers occurred during the first 30 min after combining NEWs+ and test bees. When NEWs+ were combined with bees of known ages, rather than function, mites transferred more often to young bees than to older bees (1- and 5-day-old bees vs. 25-day-old bees, P < 0.05; 1-day-old vs. 13- and 25-day-old bees; P < 0.05). No differences in proportions of transferring mites were seen when the range of bee ages was less than or equal to 8 days (P > 0.05), implying that the factors mediating the mites' adult-host preference change gradually with bee age. A possible chemical basis for host choice by Varroa is indicated by their greater propensity to move onto freezer-killed nurse bees than onto freezer-killed pollen foragers (P < 0.05) and by their lower movement onto heat-treated bees than onto control bees (P < 0.05).

Conversely, such genetically determined preferences may have been expressed, but African-like preferences may have been dominant within both colony types.

In the first part, evidence from navigational tasks with honeybees is presented which favors the interpretation that bees possess a rich and unique spatial memory of qualified and localized objects. Depending on the motivation, the bee is rather free to navigate with reference to this memory. In particular, bees are guided towards feeding places with specific expectations of their signal and reward properties. In the second part, the processes guiding the bee during its final approach to the flower are analyzed. When arriving in the close vicinity of a rewarding flower, bees first detect and recognize the achromatic green signal and then the chromatic color signal. The dependence on the optical signals of the flowers and the habitat features is studied in a comparison between plants growing in the Israeli Mediterranean and desert habitats. We find that the green contrasts of flowers in desert plants are less prominent than in Mediterranean plants because the green signal of the desert background is more similar to that of flowers, not because the green signals of desert and Mediterranean plants are different. These results are interpreted on the assumption that the green signal of flowers used in further distance detection is an adaptive property of plant species only in the context of all features supporting navigation bf insects. The low density growth of desert plants may allow for the possibility that the plants are located by insect pollinators as specified places relative to landmarks. Therefore, further distance visual signals emanating from the flower may be less important in a desert habitat, and reduced green contrast does not become an unfavorable property in desert plants. We conclude that both habitat features and flower signals contribute to the navigational system of insect pollinators, and that the evolutionary development of flower signals needs to be evaluated in the context of the plant species' habitat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0792-9978,,,,,,1997,45,2-Mar,,,,,141,156,,10.1080/07929978.1997.10676680,,,,,,,WOS:A1997YE40400007,,,,,

Both carpenter bees and bumblebees arrived mostly on the bottom third of the inflorescence and left after visiting flowers on the top third of the inflorescence. The departure position from the inflorescence was higher rep than observed in studies of other insect pollinators foraging on other speces of plants. This pattern of departure probably occurs in the absence of a vertical gradient of nectar or floral morphology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0892-7553,,,,,JAN,1997,10,1,,,,,79,86,,10.1007/BF02765475,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XG55300005,,,,,

These patterns may be innate, or they may be learned through the bees' early foraging experience. To identify the innate components of foraging rules, we characterized the flight of naive bumblebees, foraging on a non-patchy ''field'' of randomly scattered artificial flowers with three color displays. The flowers were randomly mixed and all three flower types offered equal nectar volumes. Visited flowers were refilled with probability 0.5. Flight distances, flight durations and nectar probing durations were determined and related to the bees' recent experiences. The naive bees exhibited area-restricted search behavior, i.e., flew shorter distances following visits to rewarding flowers than after visits to empty flowers. Additionally, flight distances during flower-type transitions were longer than flight distances between flowers of the same type. The two movement rules operated together: flight distances were longest for flights between flower types following non-rewarding visits, shortest for within-type flights following rewarding visits. An increase in flight displacement during flower-type shifts was also observed in a second experiment, in which all three types were always rewarding. In this experiment, flower-type shifts were also accompanied by an increase in flight duration.

In general, framed combs, both large and small, strongly attenuate higher frequencies, whereas these are amplified in small open combs. The very poor transmission properties of the large framed combs used in commercial hives may explain the bees' habit of freeing an area of comb from the frame in those areas used for dancing. Extracellular electrical recordings from the leg of a honeybee detect large action potentials from receptors that monitor extension of the tibia on the femur.

There were significant morphological differences between sub-populations of Alkanna, mainly between plants from the narrower wadis and those on the interconnecting plain.

There was a significant selection gradient between flower size and maternal fitness (seed set) in the plain, but not elsewhere.

Load masses needed to maximize the rate or energetic efficiency of individual foraging are greater than average fragment masses actually carried by Atta colombica foragers in a lowland forest in Panama. Analysis of foraging rates for a similar species, Atta cephalotes, suggests that fragments carried by this species are also below rate-maximizing size. Thus, individual rate or efficiency maximization appears not to be the ''strategic'' basis of foraging behavior in these leaf-cutting ants. Fragment size might be constrained by handling requirements, but little is known about this aspect of leaf cutting. Short absolute return times to the nest (and therefore lightweight loads) might be favored to reduce moisture loss from fragments, to reduce exposure time to parasitoid attack, or to enhance information transfer to nest mates.

The Australian allodapine bee Exoneura bicolor exhibits a number of traits that occur in cooperatively breeding bird species, including long life-span, repeated opportunities for reproduction, and vulnerability to brood predation and parasitism. We experimentally examined the effect of a potentially limiting environmental factor, nesting substrate availability, as an agent influencing sociality in E. bicolor. We manipulated nesting substrate availability in two separate locations during a time when foundress dispersal is common. No significant difference was found between colony sizes in cases where dispersal options were abundant and cases where dispersal options were limited. An increase in opportunities for dispersal did not lead to higher rates of independent nesting, suggesting that cooperative nesting is a preferred strategy regardless of distance-related costs of dispersal.

Flowering of the C. cava population lasted 39 days, with a peak on the 14th day. During the first 14 days of the flowering period, bumblebees collected pollen (i.e., pollinated), perforated the flower spur and robbed the nectar (i.e., primary nectar-robbery). Over the first nine of these days, they perforated the flower spur at random. Then, during the following five days, they learned to locate the nectar and placed most holes in spurs where the surface of the nectar was located. After having perforated most of the flowers, queens changed their behavior to the slightly faster method of secondary nectar-robbing, i.e., using old nectar-robbing holes.

Both the empirical and theoretical literatures relevant to this issue are reviewed. The methodology and results from fifty-nine studies in which animals are required to choose between foraging options differing in the variances in the rate of gain available are tabulated, We found that when risk is generated by variability in the amount of reward, animals are most frequently risk-averse and sometimes indifferent to risk, although in some studies preference depends on energy budget. In contrast, when variability is in delay to reward, animals are universally risk-prone. A range of functional, descriptive and mechanistic accounts for these findings is described, none of which alone is capable of accommodating all aspects of the data. Risk-sensitive foraging theory provides the only currently available explanation for why energy budget should affect preference. An information-processing model that incorporates Weber's law provides the only general explanation for why animals should be risk-averse with variability in amount and risk-prone with delay. A theory based on the mechanisms of associative learning explains quantitative aspects of risk-proneness for delay; specifically why the delay between choice and reward should have a stronger impact on preference than delays between the reward and subsequent choice. It also explains why animals should appear to commit the ''fallacy of the average,'' maximising the expected ratio of amount of reward over delay to reward when computing rates rather than the ratio of expected amount over expected delay. We conclude that only a fusion of functional and mechanistic thinking will lead to progress in the understanding of animal decision making.",,,,"Bateson, Melissa/B-1874-2008","Bateson, Melissa/0000-0002-0861-0191",,,,,,,,,,,,0003-1569,,,,,SEP,1996,36,4,,,,,402,434,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VN20700003,,,,,

Here we evaluate how pollinator movement among plants, apparent pollen carryover, ovule number, resource limitation of seed set, and pollen output affect variation in contribution of individual pollinator species to seed set in Lithophragma parviflorum (Saxifragaceae), a species visited by a broad spectrum of visitors, including beeflies, bees, and a moth species. A previous study demonstrated differences among visitor species in their single-visit pollination efficacy but did not evaluate how differences in visitation patterns and pollen carryover affect pollinator efficacy. Incorporation of differential visitation patterns and pollen carryover effects - commonly cited as potentially important in evaluating pollinator guilds - had minor effects (0-0.6% change) on the estimates of relative contribution based on visit frequency and single-visit efficacy alone. Beeflies visited significantly more flowers per inflorescence than the bees and the moth. Seed set remained virtually constant during the first three visited flowers for beeflies and larger bees, indicating that apparent pollen carryover did not reduce per-visit efficacy of these taxa. In contrast, Greya moth visits showed a decrease in seed set by 55.4% and the smaller bees by 45.4% from first to second flower. The larger carryover effects in smaller bees and Greya were diminished in importance by their small overall contribution to seed set. Three variable plant traits may affect seed set: ovule number, resource limitation on seed maturation, and pollen output. Ovule number per flower declined strongly with later position within inflorescences. Numbers were much higher in first-year greenhouse-grown plants than in field populations, and differences increased during 3 years of study. Mean pollen count by position varied 7-fold among flowers; it paralleled ovule number variation, resulting in a relatively stable pollen:ovule ratio. Resource limitation of seed set increased strongly with later flowering, with seed set in hand-pollinated flowers ranging from 66% in early flowers to 0% in the last two flowers of all plants. Variation in ovule number and resource limitation of seed maturation jointly had a strong effect on the number of seeds per flower. Visitation to early flowers had the potential to cause more seed set than visitation to later flowers. Overall, the most important sources of variation to seed production contribution were differences among pollinators in abundance and absolute efficacy (ovules fertilized on a single visit) and potentially differential phenology among visitor species. These effects are likely to vary among populations and years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,,,,SEP,1996,107,4,,,,,595,604,,10.1007/BF00333953,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VH67200024,28307405,,,,

This view is implicit in many discussions of angiosperm evolution and plant-pollinator coevolution and in the long-standing concept of ''pollination syndromes.'' But actual pollination systems often are more generalized and dynamic than these traditions might suggest, To illustrate the range of specialization and generalization in pollinators' use of plants and vice versa, we draw on studies of two floras in the United States, and of members of several plant families and solitary bee genera, We also summarize a recent study of one local flora which suggests that, although the colors of flowers are aggregated in ''phenotype space,'' there is no strong association with pollinator types as pollination syndromes would predict. That moderate to substantial generalization often occurs is not surprising on theoretical grounds. Plant generalization is predicted by a simple model as long as temporal and spatial variance in pollinator quality is appreciable, different pollinator species do not fluctuate in unison, and they are similar in their pollination effectiveness. Pollinator generalization is predicted when floral rewards are similar across plant species, travel is costly, constraints of behavior acid morphology are minor, and/or pollinator lifespan is long relative to flowering of individual plant species. Recognizing that pollination systems often are generalized has important implications. In ecological predictions of plant reproductive success and population dynamics it is useful to widen the focus beyond flower visitors within the ''correct'' pollination syndrome, and to recognize temporal and spatial fluidity of interactions. Behavioral studies of pollinator foraging choices and information-processing abilities will benefit from understanding the selective advantages of generalization. In studies of floral adaptation, microevolution, and plant speciation one should recognize that selection and gene flow vary in time and space and that the contribution of pollinators to reproductive isolation of plant species may be overstated. In conservation biology, generalized pollination systems imply resilience to linked extinctions, but also the possibility for introduced generalists to displace natives with a net loss of diversity.",,,,"Ollerton, Jeff/AAE-3946-2020; Ollerton, Jeff/I-3946-2012; Chittka, Lars/C-3110-2012","Ollerton, Jeff/0000-0002-0887-8235; Ollerton, Jeff/0000-0002-0887-8235; Chittka, Lars/0000-0001-8153-1732",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,JUN,1996,77,4,,,,,1043,1060,,10.2307/2265575,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UN89400009,,,,,

Longer lived bees in the fall and winter harbored mites that reproduced for a longer period than did mites in bees during spring and summer. Oviposition rate was relatively uniform at approximate to 0.85 eggs per female per day during the initial 16 d of adult bee life regardless of season. In all seasons, peak mite populations occurred in bees approximate to 24 d old, with egg laying declining rapidly beyond day 24 in spring and summer bees but more slowly in fall and winter bees. Stadial lengths of eggs and male and female larvae were 5, 4, and 5 d, respectively. Sex ratio ranged from 1.15:1 to 2.01:1, female bias, but because males are not known to migrate they would have been overestimated in the sampling scheme.

J,"Muller, A",,,,"Muller, A",,,Host-plant specialization in western palearctic Anthidiine bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Megachilidae),ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,,,,,,,,,,,,"To determine the extent of host-plant specialization, the pollen sources of the 72 anthidiine species (family Megachilidae, subfamily Megachilinae, tribe Anthidiini) of Europe, North Africa, and Asia Minor were investigated by microscopic analysis of approximate to 1800 pollen loads of females. By this measure, 31 species (43%) were oligolectic (relatively specialized to pollen source) at the level of plant tribe, plant subfamily, or plant family. Exclusive pollen sources of these bees throughout their geographic ranges are flowers of the Cardueae (Compositae), the Asteroideae (Compositae), the Papilionoideae (Leguminosae), the Lamioideae (Labiatae), the Nepetoideae (Labiatae), the Dipsacaceae, or the Campanulaceae. Thirteen species (18%) were found to exhibit a strong, but not exclusive, preference for the Papilionoideae (Leguminosae), the Labiatae, the Cardueae (Compositae), and Zygophyllum (Zygophyllaceae), respectively, while 25 species (35%) proved to be more markedly polylectic, visiting the flowers of up to 17 different plant families for pollen. The plants exploited by three species (4%) are insufficiently known. By far the most important pollen sources of the anthidiine bees as a whole are the Compositae (41.7%) followed by the Leguminosae (23.1%) and the Labiatae (13.0%). The phylogenetic relationships of the anthidiine bees were estimated by a cladistic analysis based on 115 characters to trace possible evolutionary patterns of diet composition. Based on the estimated phylogeny, at least eight shifts of oligoleges between different plant taxa and six transitions between oligolecty and polylecty appear to have occurred. Four transitions were from oligolecty to polylecty whereas two transitions are of unknown direction, both directions being equally parsimonious. Assuming that the ancestral state in the anthidiine bees was oligolectic, the present distribution of oligolectic and polylectic species can be explained solely by switches from the oligolectic to the polylectic habit and by shifts of oligoleges between different plant taxa. Three of four transitions from oligolecty to polylecty are accompanied by a reduction in bee body size. The significance of this size reduction with respect to the polylectic habit is discussed. The oligolectic anthidiine species visit significantly fewer flower species for pollen during a single foraging bout than the polylectic species. On average, 1.4 plant species were recorded in the loads of specialists compared to 2.2 for generalists. Two monophyletic groups of bees belonging to the genus Anthidium are equipped with a pollen-collecting apparatus consisting of specialized hairs localized either on the face or on the underside of the thorax. It is used to remove pollen from the raised anthers of flowers of the Labiatae and the Scrophulariaceae and to brush pollen from the flat inflorescences of some Compositae, respectively. The observation of flower-visiting females of several anthidiine species revealed that pollen uptake is far from an accidental process. Basic pollen-harvesting techniques have reached a high degree of efficiency: females of a given bee species worked flowers of a certain plant species in a fixed manner, the structures used for pollen uptake from the same flower type were found to be largely the same among anthidiine bees of different taxonomic groups, and no distinct differences with respect to the basic pattern of pollen removal from flowers of the same architecture were obvious when comparing oligolectic and polylectic species. On the other hand, polyleges showed a high intraspecific flexibility regarding the organs used for pollen uptake from flowers of a different architecture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9615,,,,,MAY,1996,66,2,,,,,235,+,,10.2307/2963476,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UH25800005,,,,,

Thoracic temperature while dancing and walking and during trophallactic contact with hive bees decreased with increasing flight distance. In bees foraging 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 molar sucrose solutions from a distance of 120 m, dancing temperature amounted to 38.4, 40.1, 40.9 and 40.6 degrees C, respectively; while in bees foraging from a distance of 2950 m it amounted to 36.6, 38.4, 38.6 and 39.1 degrees C, respectively. The rate of decrease in dancing temperature per 1000 m increase in flight distance was 0.64, 0.47, 0.81 and 0.54 degrees C with a 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 molar sucrose solution, respectively. Both at short and at long flight distances, the relationship between thoracic temperature and sucrose concentration of the food followed a non-linear curve, which flattened at concentrations higher than 1 mol/l. The experiments showed that inside the hive the foragers' level of thermoregulation depends not only on the energy (sugar) content of the food; but ether, the level of thermoregulation corresponds to the general quality of the food source, which includes both energy content and distance from the hive. Because the thermal behaviour of foragers correlates with several behavioural parameters indicating the bees' foraging tendency and their eagerness to dance, thoracic temperature seems to be a correlate of the profitability of foraging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0179-1613,,,,,MAY,1996,102,5,,,,,360,370,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UR94400002,,,,,

One hundred and seventy seven species (98 % of the total) and ten genera are endemic to the region. Within Western Australia, all members are confined to the south, with a bimodal pattern of species diversity centred on the sandplains and uplands around the Stirling Ranges and Mount Lesueur. Leucopogon, the largest genus, reflects this pattern, however, species diversity is greatest on the south coastal sandplains. All species are woody shrubs, mostly found on neutral or acidic sandy soils. Plants of al least 120 species are killed by fire; Astroloma contains the only significant number of resprouting species. Although some species are in flower every month every year, autumn/winter flowering is a common feature of many members of the family. All species are biotically pollinated. Bird pollination is found in 18 species in six genera. The remaining species are insect pollinated. Bees are the major pollinators in Leucopagon, Conostephium and Coleanthera. Moths and butterflies are important pollinators in Andersonia, Leucopogon, Lysinema and Styphelia. Flies are minor pollinators of some species of Andersonia, Leucopogon and Monotoca. All species studied are protandrous and outbreeding, with only Cosmelia being capable of self pollination. Fruits are fleshy in Astroloma, Brachyloma, Croninia, in certain species of Leucopogon and Styphelia and are animal dispersed. Other genera have dry, dehiscent fruit with gravity or wind dispersed seeds. Many species have relatively narrow distribution ranges, 90 species having ranges of over 300 km, 54 species have ranges of 100-300 km and 37 have ranges of less than 100 km (and there are many undescribed species in this group). The conservation status of many species is still poorly known. Dieback disease is a major threat to the family, and could cause the extinction of several species in the wild.

An individual's decision about which task to pursue depends both on environmental stimuli and on interactions among individuals. We examine how group size affects the allocation of individuals among the various tasks. Analysis of the models shows the following.

The two species of flies, Prosoeca peringueyi and P. sp. no., are active in the late winter and spring, have large bodies, mouthparts 20-50 mm long, and forage for nectar while hovering. Plants pollinated by these two flies share a suite of convergent floral characteristics, including a straight or slightly curved floral tube at least 20 mm and up to 70 mm long, relatively short petals or tepals colored predominantly dark blue- or red-purple with pale nectar guides, and anthers and stigmas exserted from the tube and usually unilateral in orientation. with one exception, the flowers of all species secrete large amounts of nectar of relatively constant total sugar concentration, mostly 24-29%, and high sucrose:hexose ratio. Most members of the guild have odorless flowers. The long floral tube makes nectar unavailable to most insects. including a variety of bees, wasps, and other flies that pollinate plants which co-occur with members of the long-tubed flower guild. The two Prosoeca species have mouthparts long enough to forage effectively on these long-tubed flowers, and they are also effective pollinators because pollen adheres to their bodies and is transported from flower to flower. The flies visit a wide range of plants but are effective pollinators only of those with tube lengths greater that their proboscis lengths. We have identified four mutually exclusive sites of pollen deposition on the insects' bodies: when two or more members of the guild co-occur, each species typically utilizes a different pollen deposition site. This suggests that pollen contamination is detrimental to reproductive success. Differential pollen deposition sites may have evolved in response to selection for reduced pollen contamination. Since 27 of the 28 plant species appear to depend exclusively on these two species of Prosoeca for pollination, these flies must be considered keystone species in the ecosystems where they occur.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0026-6493,,,,,,1996,83,1,,,,,67,86,,10.2307/2399969,,,,,,,WOS:A1996TT08600008,,,,,

Scouts marked all the sugar-solution feeders with a visible fluid, and the degree of marking and nestmate recruitment was positively correlated with sugar concentration. Workers exhibited characteristics of the group-foraging behaviour termed 'opportunism', whereby many foragers search independently in the field, until one of them finds an exceptional sugar-solution resource and then rapidly recruits nestmates. Overall, workers preferred the 40% sugar feeders, visitation rates decreased with increasing distance from the nest, and visits at the 20 and 10% feeders increased in that sequence when replenishment with sugar solution was interrupted and sugar concentrations declined progressively in the 40 and 20% feeders.

In returning to the starting point of their foraging excursion or to any other point, they could resort to two fundamentally different ways of navigation by using either egocentric or geocentric systems of reference. In the first case, they would rely on information continuously collected en route (path integration, dead reckoning), i.e. integrate all angles steered and all distances covered into a mean home vector. In the second case, they are expected, at least by some authors, to use a map-based system of navigation, i.e. to obtain positional information by virtue of the spatial position they occupy within a larger environmental framework. In bees and ants, path integration employing a skylight compass is the predominant mechanism of navigation, but geocentred landmark-based information is used as well. This information is obtained while the animal is dead-reckoning and, hence, added to the vector course. For example, the image of the horizon skyline surrounding the nest entrance is retinotopically stored while the animal approaches the goal along its vector course. As shown in desert ants (genus Cataglyphis), there is neither interocular nor intraocular transfer of landmark information. Furthermore, this retinotopically fixed, and hence egocentred, neural snapshot is linked to an external (geocentred) system of reference. In this way, geocentred information might more and more complement and potentially even supersede the egocentred information provided by the path-integration system. In competition experiments, however, Cataglyphis never frees itself of its homeward-bound vector - its safety-line, so to speak - by which it is always linked to home, Vector information can also be transferred to a longer-lasting (higher-order) memory. There is no need to invoke the concept of the mental analogue of a topographic map a metric map - assembled by the insect navigator. The flexible use of vectors, snapshots and landmark-based routes suffices to interpret the insect's behaviour.

Recognising scenes: when bees are displaced unexpectedly from their hive to one of several familiar locations, they are able to head in the direction of home as though they had previously linked an appropriate directional vector to a view of the scene at the release site. Biased detours: ants recognise familiar landmarks en route and will correct their path by steering consistently to the left or to the right around them. Aiming at beacons: bees and ants also guide their path by approaching familiar landmarks lying on or close to the direct line between start and finish. Simulations suggest that such mechanisms acting together may suffice to account for the routes taken by desert ants through a landmark-strewn environment: the stereotyped trajectories of individual ants call be modelled by a weighted combination of dead reckoning, biased detours and beacon-aiming. These mechanisms guide an insect sufficiently close to an inconspicuous goal for image matching to be successfully employed to locate it. Insects then move until their current retinal image matches a stored view of the surrounding panorama seen from a vantage point close to the goal. Bees and wasps perform learning flights on their first departure from a site to which they will return, These flights seem to be designed to pick up the information needed for several navigational strategies. Thus, a large portion of the learning flight of a bee leaving a feeder tends to be spent close to the feeder so aiding the acquisition of a view from that vantage point, as is needed for image matching. Bees and social wasps also tend to inspect their surroundings while facing along preferred directions and to adopt similar bearings before landing, thereby making it easy to employ retinotopically stored patterns in image matching. Aiming at beacons, in contrast, requires a landmark to be familiar to the frontal retina. Objects tend to be viewed frontally while the insect circles through arcs centred on the goal. This procedure may help insects to pick out those objects close to the goal that are best suited for guiding later returns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,JAN,1996,199,1,,,,,227,235,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996TQ56800031,,,,,

The general direction in which the insect backs away from the goal and the transition from one are segment to the next are influenced by the local scene and by compass cues.

The most important bird dispersers were tui, bellbirds and silvereyes. These birds appear to provide reasonably good quality dispersal: fruits were swallowed whole and the seeds later defecated in germinable condition; birds tended to visit plants for only 1-2 minutes and eat a few mistletoe fruits each time. Germinability of seeds ranged between species from moderate to high (17-96%). None of the study species of mistletoe germinated successfully unless the fruit skin (exocarp) was removed, by hand or by passage through a bird gut. While hand removal of the exocarp gave the same or higher percentage germination as bird removal, in the field bird dispersal is the only effective method of exocarp removal and is therefore essential. Dispersal was limiting at one of three sites studied (Craigieburn), suggesting that reductions in bellbird densities by introduced carnivores or competition for honeydew food sources may be indirectly affecting mistletoe reproduction. Establishment and survival of seedlings on host branches was low (15-28% depending on species to production of first independent leaves, 0-14% after two years). Survival of adults over one year of the study was 80% for Tupeia and 91-95% in the other species, showing that frequent establishment of seedlings is necessary for population maintenance. While disperser limitation does not seem to currently be a major threat to mistletoe survival, it must be considered as a possible factor both historically and in the future.",,,,"Kelly, Dave/A-6129-2013","Kelly, Dave/0000-0002-9469-2161",,,,,,,,,,,,0110-6465,,,,,,1996,20,1,,,,,69,79,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VP10200008,,,,,

Comparisons among animal pollinators of the spatial distributions of pollen that they produce have typically been made among morphologically disparate pairs of species. In contrast, we investigated the potential extent of pollen dispersal by honey-bees (Apis mellifera) and bumble-bees (Bombus lapidarius, B. pascuorum and B. terrestris) foraging in rows of oil-seed rape (Brassica napus cv Westar). 2. We estimated the pollen carryover attributable to individual bees by using particulate fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Most of the dye was deposited at the first few flowers probed and smaller proportions were deposited up to the 20th successively probed flower. We found no significant interspecific differences in dye carryover mediated by individuals of A. mellifera, B. lapidarius and B. terrestris with respect to either the amount deposited or the rate of decline in deposition across successively probed flowers. We present evidence that the dye produced a reasonably good analogue of pollen transfer. 3. Bees typically flew from one plant to another nearby in the same row and were strongly directional in their movements. Bee species differed significantly in their movement patterns, with B. terrestris having the greatest mean move length and directionality. 4. We used three kinds of model (a numerical simulation and two different sets of diffusion-advection equations) to attempt to emulate bee movements. The predictions from all models were reasonably consistent with the observed bee movements, although the numerical simulation invariably made the most accurate predictions, particularly over the first few moves. 5. Predicted bee movements were combined with least-squares models of dye deposition to estimate the spatial dispersal of pollen by each bee species. All models ranked the bees in the same order of decreasing effectiveness in dye dispersal: B. terrestris, A. mellifera, B. lapidarius, B. pascuorum, although, except for long-distance dispersal, there was only minor variation among the bee species in the predicted extents of dye dispersal (e.g. the models predicted that the median dispersal distance would be approximately two intervening plants irrespective of the species of bee). Overall, the consensus of the models' predictions is that most of the pollen from a source plant is deposited on immediate neighbours, but that long-distance pollen dispersal in this system extends over approximately 20-40 intervening plants from the originating plant, depending on the identity of the pollinator.",,,,"Bassom, Andrew P./F-6691-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,,,,,DEC,1995,9,6,,,,,829,841,,10.2307/2389980,,,,,,,WOS:A1995TU96300004,,,,,

During the stay inside the hive thoracic surface temperature ranged from 31.4 to 43.9 degrees C. In both round and wagtail dancing honeybees the concentration of sucrose in the food influenced dancing temperature in a non-linear way. Average dancing temperature was 37.9 degrees C in foragers gathering a 0.5 mol . l(-1) sucrose solution, 40.1 degrees C with a 1 mol . l(-1), 40.6 degrees C with a 1.5 mol . l(-1) and 40.7 degrees C with a 2 mol . l(-1) solution. The variability of thoracic temperature was highest with the 0.5 mol . l(-1) and lowest with the 1.5 and 2 mol . l(-1) concentrations. Thoracic temperatures during trophallactic contact with hive bees were similar to dancing temperature at 1.5 mol . l(-1) but lower at the other concentrations. During periods of distribution of food to hive bees (trophallactic contact >2.5 s) the dancers' thorax cooled down by more than 0.5 degrees C considerably more frequently with the 0.5 mol . l(-1) solution (65% of cases) than with the 1.5 mol . l(-1) solution (26%). By contrast, heating the thorax up by more than 0.5 degrees C was infrequent with the 0.5 mol . l(-1) solution (2%) but occurred at a maximum rate of 26% with the 1.5 mol . l(-1) solution. Bees gathering the 1 or 2 mol . l(-1) solutions showed intermediate behavior. Linear model analysis showed that at higher concentrations the dancers compensated better for variations of hive air temperature: per 1 degrees C increase of hive temperature dancing temperature increased by 0.34, 0.22, 0.12, and 0.13 degrees C with 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mol . l(-1) sucrose solutions, respectively. The results furnish evidence that dancing honeybees follow a strategy of ''selective heterothermy'' by tuning their thermal behavior to the needs of the behavior performed at the moment.

The study examined whether foragers can utilize shape (three-dimensional form) information alone as the basis for a complex foraging strategy, and if they can, which strategy is used (e.g., energy maximization, risk aversion, individual constancy)? Horizontal two-dimensional, Vertical two-dimensional, and L-Shape three-dimensional flowers were used in dimorphic artificial flower patches. When rewards were identical in flower morphs, bees showed no uniform preference. Some bees foraged randomly, while other bees had flower morph preferences, but not all to the same flower type. When rewards differed between flower morphs, bees utilized flower form to restrict flower visitation to the morph offering the greater caloric reward. Forager behavior thus conformed only to expectations of the energy maximization model. Forager ''error'' rate (choice of the flower morph offering the lower caloric reward) within flower-form dimorphic patches, however, was approximately three times that observed when only a color dimorphism existed. Bees changed flower morph preference usually on their first visit to the flower patch after rewards were altered, often after visiting just one flower with the lower caloric reward.

While temporal variation in pollinator composition has been widely reported, spatial variability, particularly on a local scale, has been studied less frequently; nevertheless, available evidence suggests that local spatial variability may be a widespread feature of plant-pollinator interactions. In addition, the causes of this spatial variability are poorly known. This study was undertaken to quantify variability in the taxonomic composition of pollinators visiting local populations of black mustard, Brassica nigra, and to determine some of the causes of this variability. Simultaneous observations were conducted in seven pairs of black mustard populations. The members of each pair were in close spatial proximity but differed in number of plants. Larger plant populations were visited by significantly greater numbers of honey bees and significantly fewer small bees than small populations on a per-plant basis. There was also a trend toward greater syrphid fly visitation in small populations. The increased numbers of honey bees at large plant populations is probably due to their ability to recruit long distances to the most rewarding plant populations. The lower number of small bees at large plant populations may be due to competition from honey bees and/or spreading a constant number of small bees over the larger number of plants in large populations.",,,,"Conner, Jeffrey/F-3188-2011","Conner, Jeffrey/0000-0003-1613-5826",,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,,,,OCT,1995,104,2,,,,,218,224,,10.1007/BF00328586,,,,,,,WOS:A1995TB68800010,28307358,,,,

Yet the third dimension, height above ground, may be significant in the tall and dense forest habitats of stingless bees. Foragers of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona postica recruit to a specific three-dimensional location by laying a scent trail. Stingless bees in the genus Melipona are thought to have a more sophisticated recruitment system that communicates distance through sounds inside the nest and direction through pointing zig-zag flights outside the nest. However, prior research on Melipona has not examined height communication or even established that foragers can recruit newcomers to a specific location. We used identical paired feeders to investigate recruitment to food in M. panamica on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We trained foragers from an observation hive to one feeder and monitored both feeders for the subsequent arrival of newcomers. We changed the relative positions of the feeders to test for correct direction, distance, and canopy-level communication. A 40-m canopy tower located inside the forest enabled us to examine canopy-level communication. We found that M. panamica foragers can recruit to a specific (1) direction, (2) distance, and (3) canopy level. To test the possibility that foragers accomplish this by means of a scent trail, we placed the colony on one shore of a small cove and trained bees over 116 m of open water to a feeder located on the opposite shore. We also placed a second feeder on this shore, equidistant from the colony but 20 m from the first feeder. Significantly more newcomers consistently arrived at the feeder visited by the foragers. Thus foragers evidently do not need a scent trail to communicate direction. Inside the nest, a forager produces pulsed sounds while visibly vibrating her wings after returning from a good food source. She is attended by other bees who cluster and hold their antennae around her, following her as she rapidly spins clockwise and counterclockwise. Locational information may be encoded in this behavior. However, foragers may also directly lead newcomers to the food source.

Crabs were displaced, being kept under water, with full vision of the sky and landscape and released 5 m away from their refuges, at a maximum depth of 50 cm.

Behavioural reactions, such as the distant approach, the close-range orientation, the landing, and the extension of mouthparts can be triggered by colour stimuli. The physiological limitations of spectral sensitivity, the neuro-sensory filters, and the animals' different abilities to make use of visual information such as brightness perception, wavelength-specific behaviour and colour vision shape colour preferences.

Any vector navigation system requires that the animal is able to evaluate the angles steered and the distances travelled. Here we investigate whether the ants acquire the latter information by monitoring self-induced optic flow. To answer this question, the animals were trained and tested within perspex channels in which patterns were presented underneath a transparent walking platform. The patterns could be moved at different velocities (up to > 0.5 the ant's walking speed) in the same or in the opposite direction relative to the direction in which the animal walked. Experimental manipulations of the optic flow influenced the ant's homing distances (Figs. 2 and 4). Distance estimation depends on the speed of self-induced image motion rather than on the contrast frequency, indicating that the motion sensitive mechanism involved is different from mechanisms mediating the optomotor response. Experiments in which the ants walked on a featureless floor, or in which they wore eye covers (Fig. 6), show that they are able also to use additional (probably kinesthetic) cues for assessing their travel distance.

We identify key elements of information processing and ecological factors determining the costs and benefits of two foraging alternatives. On the one hand, specializing on a single prey type while ignoring other types increases the distance a forager must move; this involves increased energy and time expenditures. On the other hand, switching between searching for several prey types has the obvious cost of an initial reduction in the probability of detecting prey immediately after switching. Switching also has the less apparent cost of a forager's reduced ability to assess the probability of prey presence. We show that if the cost of switching is sufficiently high, and a forager estimates that one prey type is more common than others, then the forager should search for this prey only, unless conditions change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,JUN,1995,76,4,,,,,1320,1326,,10.2307/1940938,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QZ87800027,,,,,

To examine potential causes of highly leptokurtic deposition, we introduce four functions that arise when (1) the duration of pollinator visits to pollen sources is limited, (2) the rate of pollen deposition varies randomly among pollinators and/or among visits, (3) the rate of pollen deposition changes monotonically over time or (4) pollen is carried in layers or compartments on the pollinator's body that differ in deposition rate. Maximum likelihood techniques were used to fit deposition functions to data obtained from honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) visiting mustard plants (Brassica campestris L.) that contained a marker gene. Each of the alternative leptokurtic functions fit the experimental data better than a simple exponential function and the best-fit function predicted a mean pollen dispersal distance more than three times greater than the exponential.

J,"HAMMER, M; MENZEL, R",,,,"HAMMER, M; MENZEL, R",,,LEARNING AND MEMORY IN THE HONEYBEE,JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Insects are favorable subjects for neuroethological studies. Their nervous systems are relatively small and contain many individually identifiable cells. The CNS is highly compartmentalized with clear separations between multisensory higher order neuropiles in the brain and neuropiles serving sensory-motor routines in the ventral cord (Huber, 1974). The rich behavior of insects includes orientation in space and time, visual, chemical, and mechanical communication, and complex motor routines for flying, walking, swimming, nest building, defense, and attack. Learning and memory, though, are not usually considered to be a strong point of insects. Rather, insect behavior is often regarded as highly stereotyped and under tight control of genetically programmed neural circuits. This view, however, does not do justice to the insect order of Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants). Most Hymenopteran species care for their brood either as individual females or as a social group of females. Consequently, they regularly return to their nest site to feed, protect, and nurse the larvae, store food, and hide from adverse environmental conditions. Since they search for food (prey; nectar and pollen on flowers) at unpredictable sites, they have to learn the celestial and terrestrial cues that guide their foraging trips over long distances and allow them to find their nest sites (central place foraging; von Frisch, 1967; Seeley, 1985). They learn to relate the sun's position and sky pattern of polarized light to the time of the day (Lindauer, 1959), and landmarks are learned in relationship to the nest site within the framework of the time-compensated sun compass. The honeybee communicates direction and distance of a feeding place to hive mates by performing a ritualized body movement, the waggle dance (von Frisch, 1967). Associative learning is an essential component of the bee's central place foraging behavior and dance communication. Hive mates attending a dance performance learn the odor emanating from the dancing bee and seek it at the indicated food site. The odor, color, and shape of flowers are learned when the bee experiences these stimuli shortly before it finds food (nectar, pollen). This appetitive learning in bees has many characteristics of associative learning well known from mammalian learning studies (Menzel, 1985, 1990; Bitterman, 1988). It follows the rules of classical and operant conditioning, respectively, so that stimuli or behavioral acts are associated with evaluating stimuli. Since associative learning, especially of the classical type, is well described at the phenomenological and operational level (Rescorla, 1988), it provides a favorable approach in the search for the neural substrate underlying learning and memory. In particular, associative learning in bees is a fast and robust process. A single associative learning trial, even under conditions when the bee is immobilized for the taking of intracellular recordings from brain neurons, leads to highly significant changes in its behavior and in the response characteristics of identified neurons. Memory induced by a single learning trial lasts for days, and by three learning trials in a free-flying bee, for a lifetime. Here, we shall discuss (1) the role of identified neurons in simpler as well as in more complex forms of learning, (2) the localization of different memory traces and their joint contribution to learned behavior, and (3) the formation of memory in multiple phases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0270-6474,,,,,MAR,1995,15,3,1,,,,1617,1630,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QM46700001,7891123,,,,

I studied fruit and seed set, flower duration, and the intrafloral thermal environment of N. longispathus, and the thermal biology, foraging behavior, and thermoregulatory ability of A. bicolor over a 6-yr period in southeastern Spain. N. longispathus flowers from February to April, when unsuitable weather often limits pollinator activity, yet most flowers are successfully pollinated in all years and sites. Fruit set was weakly pollen limited, but among flowers setting fruit the proportion of ovules developing into seeds was not. Individual flowers lasted for 17 d on average, remaining functional during this period. On sunny days, the air inside N. longispathus flowers was significantly warmer than outside. Mean temperature excess inside flowers was as high as 8 degrees C, and was positively related to solar irradiance. Within flowers, air temperature was highest around the anthers; this intrafloral gradient was consistent with variation among perianth parts in radiation transmittance. Andrena bicolor foraged in N. longispathus flowering patches only on sunny days with air temperature >12 degrees-13 degrees C, and foraging behavior and flower visitation rate were temperature dependent. Bees were able to fly at relatively low thoracic temperatures (T-th; range 22 degrees-31 degrees C) and this was essential for successfully foraging at N. longispathus. Under the range of irradiance and air temperature found at foraging sites, A. bicolor individuals inside flowers were able to reach T-th suitable for flight by passive means alone. Under laboratory conditions, A. bicolor was unable to raise or otherwise regulate T-th by physiological means, but free-flying individuals thermoregulated behaviorally. Basking was used to raise T-th and intrafloral microclimate, by influencing the proportion of foraging time devoted to basking, played an important role in thermoregulation. Flower visitation rate was positively related to the average temperature inside visited flowers, and the probability of basking immediately after one floral visit declined with increasing flower temperature. I conclude that the favorable microclimate within N. longispathus flowers, their long duration, and the thermal biology of A. bicolor, were critical elements in this early-season pollination system.",,,,"Herrera, Carlos M/A-4088-2008","Herrera, Carlos M/0000-0003-2452-3888",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,JAN,1995,76,1,,,,,218,228,,10.2307/1940644,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QC87200019,,,,,

This hypothesis was tested using a paradigm, in which forager bees were temporarily made to fly stationarily in a wind tunnel on their way to and from the feeding site, so that information about the way to the feeding site, but not the information about the location of the food source, was experimentally influenced.

Information encoded in the dance was used to determine the distance and direction that bees flew from the hive for pollen and nectar and to construct foraging maps for each colony.

Honeybees Apis mellifera ligustica were trained to work on a patch with artificial rewarding and non-rewarding flowers, coupled to an air extractor. The perceptual colour distance between the rewarding and the non-rewarding flowers was varied and the flower choice and the repellent scent-marking behaviour of the bees were recorded. 2. The discrimination between rewarding and non-rewarding flowers depended on their colour distance, improving with a greater colour difference. This task was guided thus visually and was not affected by activating the air extractor. 3. The scent-marking activity was only observable when the colour information of both groups of flowers was the same or very similar. This thus represents the first reported case of a modulation of an olfactory activity through the visual input provided by colour distances. When the air extractor was activated, rejections associated with the scent-marking behaviour disappeared, thus confirming the olfactory nature of this behaviour. 4. Honeybees are thus capable of using one or more sensory cues to enhance their foraging efficiency, according to the environmental situation. This great plasticity allows them to attain an enhanced efficiency while foraging. 5. We successfully applied the model of colour choice behaviour of the honeybee.

We subsequently tested returning bees with landmarks of different sizes and thus introduced large discrepancies between the angular size of the landmark as seen from the nest during training and its distance from the nest. The bees' search behaviour and their choice of dummy nest entrances show that both species of ground-nesting bees consistently search for their nest at the learned distance from landmarks.

The direction-averaging model predicts that the radial distance of search should not change on these tests, compared with radial distance of search on control tests without conflicting cues. The vector-averaging (vector sum) model predicts that when pigeons average the two conflicting cues, the radial distance of search should be shorter. Results support the direction-averaging model and suggest that distance and direction are independently computed in landmark-based search.

The behaviour and activity patterns of Apis mellifera and of five species of Bombus were analysed in relation to climatic variables and nectar quality on three varieties of unsprayed cultivated raspberry (Rubus idaeus) in eastern Scotland. 2. Stages of floral morphology and reward were similar for the three varieties: young flowers offered both nectar and pollen, but medium and old flowers offered nectar only, in diminishing quantities. 3. A wide range of insects visited raspberry flowers, but bees were dominant, bumblebees being responsible for about 60% of all visits and honeybees making up most of the remaining percentage. All bees had substantial pollen deposited on their bodies during visits, though few specifically collected it. 4. Bombus spp. were found to favour young (receptive) flowers strongly, especially early in the morning when pollen was most abundant; whilst Apis visited unselectively. Bumblebees also foraged over substantially longer periods of the day, and in poorer weather, some being present at most times of observation; and they foraged more quickly in terms of flower visits per minute. 5. Bombus carried more pollen on their bodies than Apis, and also deposited more pollen on raspberry stigmas, with B. lapidarius and B. terrestris being particularly effective and also being the most abundant species. All bumblebees also foraged over a longer range, moving between canes and rows more frequently than did honeybees. 6. Bumblebees are therefore likely to be substantially more important as pollinators of raspberries than are honeybees, especially as raspberries though moderately self-fertile may exhibit metaxenia. Reasons why Bombus may be the preferred pollinator in most sites of raspberry cultivation are discussed, together with implications for present and future growers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,,,,,AUG,1994,19,3,,,,,271,284,,10.1111/j.1365-2311.1994.tb00419.x,,,,,,,WOS:A1994PA21500009,,,,,

They learn about landmarks both when approaching and when leaving the site. Whereas learning on arrival can take place on every visit to the food source, learning on departure is limited to the first few visits, when the bee Turns Back and Looks (TBL) at the feeder in a stereotyped manoeuvre before flying off. We investigated whether one specific function of TBLs is to acquire information about the absolute distance of landmarks from the feeding site. Bees were trained to forage from a feeder which lay at a fixed distance from a cylinder. During training, bees were exposed to the cylinder either only while they approached and landed on the feeder, or only on their departure from it, or at both of these times. Tests on trained bees immediately after the TBL phase revealed that those bees which had viewed the cylinder only on arrival had learnt the apparent size of the cylinder, but not its distance from the feeder. In contrast, bees which saw the cylinder on departure had learnt its absolute distance. They also learnt the cylinder's apparent size, provided that the cylinder was close to the feeder. Bees which had viewed the cylinder on arrival as well as on departure learnt both absolute distance and apparent size. Distance dominated the bees' behaviour in the initial phase of learning, apparent size was more important later on. We suggest that early during learning bees need information about the 3-D structure of the environment so that they can identify those landmarks close to a foraging site which will specify accurately the site's position. This information is acquired during TBLs. Later, landmark guidance can be achieved by 2-D image matching.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-7594,,,,,AUG,1994,175,2,,,,,171,177,,10.1007/BF00215113,,,,,,,WOS:A1994PA30600006,,,,,

Penn. (Scrophulariaceae) is a self-incompatible annual distributed from central Texas south into northern Mexico. In central Texas, flowering can begin in mid-July and continue through mid-October. Pollinators are Bombus pennsylvanicus and Apis mellifera. Previous field experiments have shown that two populations differ in seed production from single bee visit experiments (Wellhouse population with a high seed production and Firefly Meadow population with a low seed production). An isozyme study was undertaken to discern whether any differences in genetic structure existed between the two populations that might be associated with the difference in seed production. Populations of A. strictifolia maintain high levels of genetic diversity with values ranging from 0.200 to 0.233. Values of F(ST) showed significant genetic structure among subpopulations at the Wellhouse (WH) population but not at Firefly Meadow (FM). Most of the variation occurred between subpopulations rather than between populations. Inbreeding coefficients (F(IS)) and outcrossing rates (t) differed only slightly between populations and suggested that both were primarily outcrossing. Estimated migration rates (Nm) based on F(ST) values differed greatly between populations with FM having a migration rate that was 4.6 x greater than at WH. At FM, annual variability in density and a requirement for multiple bee visits for full seed production may account for the high migration rate. The Mantel's Z test for correlation between matrices of Rogers' genetic similarity and interplant distance was significant for both populations. The relationship was negative as expected at the WH population but positive at FM. A positive relationship between these has not been previously reported. Despite the genetic differences detected, no clear distinction was noted that could easily be connected with the previously observed difference in seed production from single bee visits.",,,,"Dieringer, Gregg/J-3882-2019","Dieringer, Gregg/0000-0002-2669-1204",,,,,,,,,,,,0040-9618,,,,,APR-JUN,1994,121,2,,,,,148,153,,10.2307/2997166,,,,,,,WOS:A1994NY13800005,,,,,

J,"SEELEY, TD",,,,"SEELEY, TD",,,HONEY-BEE FORAGERS AS SENSORY UNITS OF THEIR COLONIES,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Forager honey bees function not only as gatherers of food for their colonies, but also as sensory units shaped by natural selection to gather information regarding the location and profitability of forage sites. They transmit this information to colony members by means of waggle dances. To investigate the way bees transduce the stimulus of nectar-source profitability into the response of number of waggle runs, I performed experiments in which bees were stimulated with a sucrose solution feeder of known profitability and their dance responses were videorecorded. The results suggest that several attributes of this transduction process are adaptations to enhance a bee's effectiveness in reporting on a forage site. (1) Bees register the profitability of a nectar source not by sensing the energy gain per foraging trip or the rate of energy gain per trip, but evidently by sensing the energetic efficiency of their foraging. Perhaps this criterion of nectar-source profitability has been favored by natural selection because the foraging gains of honey bees are typically limited by energy expenditure rather than time availability. (2) There is a linear relationship between the stimulus of energetic efficiency of foraging and the response of number of waggle runs per dance. Such a simple stimulus-response function appears adequate because the range of suprathreshold stimuli (max/min ratio of about 10) is far smaller than the range of responses (max/min ratio of about 100). Although all bees show a linear stimulus-response function, there are large differences among individuals in both the response threshold and the slope of the stimulus-response function. This variation gives the colony a broader dynamic range in responding to food sources than if all bees had identical thresholds of dance response. (3) There is little or no adaptation in the dance response to a strong stimulus (tonic response). Thus each dancing bee reports on the current level of profitability of her forage site rather than the changes in its profitability. This seems appropriate since presumably it is the current profitability of a forage site, not the change in its profitability, which determines a site's attractiveness to other bees. (4) The level of forage-site quality that is the threshold for dancing is tuned by the bees in relation to forage availability. Bees operate with a lower dance threshold when forage is sparse than when it is abundant. Thus a colony utilizes input about a wide range of forage sites when food is scarce, but filters out input about low-reward sites when food is plentiful. (5) A dancing bee does not present her information in one spot within the hive but instead distributes it over much of the dance floor. Consequently, the dances for different forage sites are mixed together on the dance floor. This helps each bee following the dances to take a random sample of the dance information, which is appropriate for the foraging strategy of a honey bee colony since it is evidently designed to allocate foragers among forage sites in proportion to their profitability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,1432-0762,,,,JAN,1994,34,1,,,,,51,62,,10.1007/BF00175458,,,,,,,WOS:A1994MV06800007,,,,,

Prior to absconding, waggle dances regularly communicated distances up to 10-20 km from the nests. However, compared to waggle dances observed during nonabsconding periods, those occurring prior to migration were less associated with food sources, occurred during periods of little or no flight activity, and exhibited great variability in the communication of distance by consecutive waggle runs of individual bees. It is therefore unlikely that ''migration dances'' communicated the locations of, or stimulated immediate recruitment for, specific foraging or nesting sites. Rather, the dances may have functioned to establish a general route of travel. The majority of migration dances observed were oriented in an easterly direction, and upon departure both colonies traveled towards the E-SE. The orientation of migration dances occurred independently of the directions communicated by waggle dances associated with past foraging success or the sampling of alternate foraging areas. Migration dance orientation may have been affected by prevailing wind directions, because during the migration period winds blew primarily from the east. However, it is unlikely that wind direction was the only factor influencing migration dance orientation. The lack of immediate flight activity associated with migration dance performance suggests the dances may have gradually prepared colonies for migratory movement by conveying a message to fly for a long, but unspecified distance in a certain direction. Waggle dances associated with migration may therefore function differently from those associated with foraging and nest site selection, which convey both the distance and direction to specific locations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0020-1812,,,,,,1994,41,2,,,,,115,127,,10.1007/BF01240472,,,,,,,WOS:A1994NK12600001,,,,,

During the immigration phase, early-arriving colonies stayed only temporarily, as if assessing habitat quality.

These observations support the idea that migration allows colonies to track seasonally varying resources in different regions.

In addition, C. cotoneaster is self-incompatible, an unusual condition in the New Zealand flora.

The working hypothesis for bee foraging behavior in three dimensions is that forager experience can produce stratum fidelity, just as rewarding foraging produces floral fidelity. Wide-ranging search behavior should allow bees to track spatio-temporal distribution of resources. A systematic study of 20 bee species and 10 genera: Apis, Trigona, Eulaema, Centris, Euglossa, Scaptotrigona, Partamona, Megalopta, Rhinetula, and Oxytrigona was made in two forests in Panama. Two traps were operated simultaneously at canopy height and in the understory to test whether there were consistent stratum associations. Studies were continuous for 1 and 8 years. The only high-canopy foragers were two nocturnal bees, all the rest flew at both heights with similar probability or consistently came to lower traps. Large euglossines showed a tendency to forage high, which was directly related to their capacity for heat loss during flight, compared to smaller euglossines. They are also more conspicuous in warning coloration, another expected correlate of foraging more often in the open. Although large variance in stratum association predominates, some medium-sized diurnal forest bees avoid the exposed upper canopy, while some nocturnal bees tend to forage there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0892-7553,,,,,NOV,1993,6,6,,,,,659,673,,10.1007/BF01201668,,,,,,,WOS:A1993MH12100001,,,,,

A 1 m circle of non-transgenic plants was sown in the centre of the transgenic area to allow estimation of the level of pollen dispersal when plants were in close contact. Honeybee hives were placed at the trial site to optimize the opportunity for cross-pollination. During the flowering period, regular observations were made of the number of plants flowering and the number and type of insects present in 60 1 m(2) areas. These areas were located uniformly around the plot at distances of 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 47 m from the edge of the 9 m circle of transgenic plants.

The underlying assumption is that poor fliers and/or communal foragers frequently effect selfing which in turn, given sufficiently severe inbreeding depression, should favor the establishment of dioecy. At least 10% of the genera of the angiosperms includes dioecious species; in tropical flowering plants, however, pollinators are reliably known only in a few species. Whereas temperate dioecious species commonly are wind- or water-pollinated, anemophily is less important in tropical forests, but occurs in at least 30 dioecious genera. Our survey of tropical dioecious zoophilous species in 29 genera (in 21 families) for which detailed pollination information is available shows that these species have specialized flowers adapted to specific pollinators rather than generalized flowers suitable for diverse insects. Known pollinators include solitary and eusocial bees, beetles, moths, flies, wasps (including fig wasps), and rarely bats and birds, and cover a wide range in animal size and locomotive capabilities. Floral rewards comprise pollen, nectar, stylar mucilage, nutritious tissues, brood-places, and resins. About a third of the species offer no reward in the female morph, pollination by deceit apparently being common. Our data thus do not support the hypothesis that there is a broad correlation between a dioecious breeding system and unspecialized pollination, although such a correlation may be found in certain taxa.

Though models with different currencies (and assumptions) have been successful at describing forager behavior, discriminating among currencies has proven difficult because models optimizing different currencies often make similar predictions. A field experiment was designed to use flight speeds of Black Terns (Chlidonias nigra) feeding their young to test predictions from optimal foraging models that maximize (1) the net energy gained per unit of energy expended (efficiency; EFF), (2) the net rate of energy intake (NREI), and (3) the daily delivery rate (DR), respectively. Manipulating the distance an adult had to fly between a feeding enclosure and its nest enabled us to discriminate among the three currencies. Predicted speeds of the EFF model best matched the observed flight speeds. Maximizing efficiency resulted in the lowest delivery rate to the nest, but it was also the only currency that predicted adult daily energy expenditures within the theoretical limit (DEE(max)) estimated for Black Terns (206 kJ/d; Kirkwood 1983). The feeding enclosure represented an unusually profitable food source for the terns, and this may have resulted in artificially high predictions for flight speed, particularly for the NREI and DR currencies. We therefore made another set of predictions from the three models using estimates of foraging success from parents who had never foraged from the feeding enclosure, and compared these predictions with the measured airspeeds. The EFF model was apain the best predictor of flight speeds even though none of the three models predicted energy expenditures in excess of DEE(max). Though the DR model resulted in the highest total daily energy delivered to the nest, this represented only a small gain relative to the NREI and EFF models.

The greatest differences between the two subcastes were observed on the thorax of workers. Principal component analyses performed on the hydrocarbons (or hydrocarbon combinations) corresponding to the 45 main peaks in the cuticular profiles of the head and thorax of brood-tenders and foragers of several colonies show that there exist quantitative differences between the various signatures that characterize the colony, the worker subcastes, and the various body parts within the same species, which can be classified in a hierarchy where the differences between worker subcastes are less pronounced than those between body pans or between colonies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0098-0331,,,,,JUL,1993,19,7,,,,,1461,1477,,10.1007/BF00984890,,,,,,,WOS:A1993LL39600015,24249176,,,,

To help understand how honeybees might acquire such routes, we examined whether (1) bees learn motor sequences, (2) they link motor instructions to visual stimuli, (3) their visual memories are triggered by contextual cues associated with the bees' position in a sequence. 1. Bees were trained to follow a complex route through a series of obstacles inside a large, 250 cm by 250 cm box. In tests, the obstacles were briefly removed and the bees continued to fly the same zig-zag trajectory that they had when the obstacles were present. The bees' complex trajectory could reflect either the performance of a sequence of motor instructions or their attempt to reach fixed points in their environment. When the point of entry to the box was shifted, the bees' trajectory with respect to the new point of entry was relatively unchanged, suggesting that bees have learnt a motor sequence. 2. Bees were trained along an obstacle course in which different flight directions were associated with the presence of different large patches of colour. In tests, the order of coloured patches was reversed, the trajectory followed by the bees was determined by the order of colours rather than by the learnt motor sequence suggesting that bees will readily link the performance of a particular trajectory to an arbitrary visual stimulus. 3. Bees flew through a series of 3 similar compartments to reach a food reward. Passage from one compartment to the next was only possible through the centre of one of a pair of patterns, e.g. white + ve vs. black - ve in the first box, blue + ve vs. yellow - ve in the second, vertical + ve vs. horizontal - ve in the last. In some tests, bees were presented with a white vs. a vertical stimulus in the front compartment, while, in other tests, the same pair of stimuli was presented in the rear compartment. Bees preferred the white stimulus when tested in the first compartment, but chose the vertical stimulus in the last compartment.

Nevertheless, our understanding of the mechanism that generates spatial patterns of pollen dispersal in animal-pollinated plants, namely the combined processes of pollinator movement and pollen deposition, is at present qualitative. I show how easily measured characteristics of pollinator movement and pollen deposition can be used to build models that generate quantitative predictions about pollen dispersal distance. A field experiment in which I followed honey bees (Apis mellifera) foraging on one-dimensional arrays of mustard plants (Brassica campestris) indicated that individual honeybees have a biased direction of movement and alter their movement patterns in response to plant spacing.

DESCRIPTION OF FLIGHT",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bees and wasps are known to use a visual representation of the nest environment to guide the final approach to their nest. It is also known that they acquire this representation during an orientation flight performed on departure. A detailed film analysis shows that orientation flights in solitary wasps of the genus Cerceris consist of a systematic behavioural sequence: after lift-off from the nest entrance, wasps fly in ever increasing arcs around the nest. They fly along these arcs obliquely to their long axis and turn so that the nest entrance is held in the left or right visual field at retinal positions between 30-degrees and 70-degrees from the midline. Horizontal distance from the nest and height above ground increase throughout an orientation flight so that the nest is kept at retinal elevations between 45-degrees and 60-degrees below the horizon. The wasps' rate of turning is constant at between 100-degrees/s and 200-degrees/s independent of their distance from the nest and their ground velocity increases with distance. The consequence of this is that throughout the flight wasps circle at a constant angular velocity around the nest. Orientation flights are strongly influenced by landmark lay-out. Wasps adjust their flight-path and their orientation in a way that allows them to fixate the nest entrance and to hold the closest landmark in their frontal visual field. The orientation flight generates a specific topography of motion parallax across the visual field. This could be used by wasps to acquire a series of snapshots that all contain the nest position, to acquire snapshots of close landmarks only (distance filtering), to exclude shadow contours from their visual representation (figure-ground discrimination) or to gain information on the distance of landmarks relative to the nest.",,,,"Zeil, Jochen/C-9223-2009",,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-7594,,,,,MAR,1993,172,2,,,,,189,205,,10.1007/BF00189396,,,,,,,WOS:A1993KR96100006,,,,,

SIMILARITIES BETWEEN ORIENTATION AND RETURN FLIGHTS AND THE USE OF MOTION PARALLAX",JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cerceris wasps learn the position of their nest relative to landmarks during the performance of orientation flights. This paper examines the similarities that exist between an orientation flight made on departing from the nest and the subsequent return flight to the nest area. Returning wasps do not exactly retrace the paths they have flown during the preceding orientation flight. But there are striking similarities: in both types of flight wasps face into similar directions and their orientation depends on their position relative to nest and landmarks in a similar way. During both orientation flights and returns wasps fly along arcs while counter-turning at similar angular velocities. In both flights their flight direction and the retinal position of close landmarks are similar. Wasps on their return thus experience much the same spatio-temporal pattern of visual stimulation on their retina as they generated during their previous orientation flight. To discover whether wasps exploit the motion parallax information produced by these flights, the arrangement and size of landmarks was altered between the insects' departure and their return. Their search pattern for the hidden nest indicates (i) that they weight close landmarks more heavily than distant ones and (ii) that they frequently search at the appropriate distance from a landmark regardless of its apparent size. Both findings imply that returning wasps recall the patterns of visual motion produced during their orientation flights.",,,,"Zeil, Jochen/C-9223-2009",,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-7594,,,,,MAR,1993,172,2,,,,,207,222,,10.1007/BF00189397,,,,,,,WOS:A1993KR96100007,,,,,

In different experimental combinations of reward rates, color marks, odors and distances of the feeders, the behavior of the test bee was monitored by a computer in real time by several devices installed in each feeder. The test bee optimizes by partially matching its choice behavior to the reward rates of the feeders. The matching behavior differs strongly between ''stay'' flights (the bee chooses the feeder just visited) and ''shift'' flights (the bee chooses one of the three alternative feeders). The probability of stay and shift flights depends on the reward sequence and on the time interval between successive visits. Since functions describing the rising probability of stay flights with rising amounts of sucrose solution just experienced differ for the four feeders, it is concluded that bees develop feeder-specific memories. The choice profiles of shift flights between the three alternative feeders depend on the mean reward rate of the feeder last visited. Good matching is found after visits to the low-reward feeders and poor matching following departure from the high-reward feeders. These results indicate that bees use two different kinds of memories to guide their choice behavior: a transient short-term working memory that is not feeder-specific, and a feeder-specific long-term reference memory. Model calculations were carried out to test this hypothesis. The model was based on a learning rule (the difference rule) developed by Rescorla and Wagner (1972), which was extended to the two forms of memories to predict this operant behavior. The experiments show that a foraging honeybee learns the properties of a food source (its signals and rewards) so effectively that specific expectations guide the choice behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,,,,,JAN,1993,32,1,,,,,17,29,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993KH88100003,,,,,

To vary resource profitability, we changed the quantity of artificial nectar baits presented to foragers and the distance of nectar baits from the nest. Both distance to and amount of resource affected quantitative aspects of recruitment. At increased distances foragers were less likely to recruit, and fewer workers were recruited to the resource area. The amount of nectar affected the tendency of foragers to recruit, but had no effect on the number of ants recruited. Variation in resource distance was also associated with qualitative changes in recruitment strategy. Foragers at distant sites recruited from the canopy rather than from the nest, and often transferred nectar to other workers for transport to the nest. Nectar transfer and extra-nidal recruitment significantly reduced the time required for resource collection. It may also have increased the ability of workers to specialize in specific foraging tasks. A portion of the colony's foraging force specialized spatially by remaining in distant foraging areas without returning to the nest.

After training, the bees were exposed to side-light flashes on their homing route in the arena. The flight paths were recorded on video and analyzed frame by frame with reference to the the main parameters, the course angle, the yaw angle and the ground velocity of the bee. The responses to side light flashes were evaluated with respect to 'on' and 'off' and to the level of coupling between the orienting subsystems (course, yawing and speed control). Bees behave differently on feeding and homing flight: it seems that honeybees respond much more by phototaxis and less by pattern-orientation on their homing rout when disturbed by side light flashes. Two categories of responses, early and late light switch reactions, are traced in both ocellar states (fully sighted and ocelli-occluded). They reveal opposite polarities and can be observed in all main parameters investigated in free flight. Usually, the orienting subsystems seem to be more or less coupled. Under arousal by light disturbance, a kind of servo-control of flight direction by the orientation of the body can be postulated. But the subsystems also operate loosely, making a recurrent change of the visual orientation strategies possible. This principle, however, can be modified and even cancelled in ocelli-occluded bees. Observed on the individual level, the orienting systems might behave undamped causing resonance effects and overdriving. Observed on supraindividual level, the orienting subsystems are coupled more strongly in ocelli-occluded bees. This forces them to stick to prefixed programmes more than fully sighted bees.

The model uses a submodel of resource renewal and depletion, and the principle that individuals attempt to maximize individual fitness, to construct habitat isolines. The habitat isoline for a population of nectarivores is a line in an abundance phase-plane along which all individuals of the population, regardless of the habitat they are currently exploiting, have equal expected fitness. At equilibrium the habitat isoline determines the distribution of a population between two habitats given a fixed abundance of competitors. The habitat isolines for populations of two species exploiting two habitats can be used to predict the equilibrium distribution of both species. I illustrate the model using data about bumble bees foraging for nectar in flowers (Inouye 1978). An asset of the model is its ability to make a priori predictions about flower exploitation patterns using information about resource dynamics and the foraging abilities of the nectarivores. Two warnings regarding the empirical detection of exploitation competition between species emerge from the model analysis. Depending on the range over which density manipulations are carried out in exploitation competition systems, competition may or may not be detected, while interspecific competition may or may not appear to be more intense than intraspecific competition.

Inoculum density of G. roseum on strawberry flowers visited by contaminated bees averaged 22 000 and 1500 cfu/flower, respectively, in two greenhouse studies and ranged from 1600 to 27 000 and from 300 to 15 000 cfu/flower, respectively, in two field studies. Inoculum transfer was greater when conditions favored foraging of the bees on the flowers. In the field, inoculum density of G. roseum on flowers inoculated by bees usually was as high as or higher, and more stable, than on flowers of plants sprayed weekly with a spore suspension of 10(7) conidia G. roseum/mL water plus surfactant. In field plots (but not in field microplots) G. roseum significantly suppressed incidence of B. cinerea on petals, stamens, and fruit when applied as sprays or by bees, and effectiveness of the application methods did not, on average, differ significantly.

The amount of nectar a bee receives from an individual flower was estimated by measuring the time elapsed since the previous bee visit to that flower. Measurements of nectar accumulation in experimentally emptied flowers indicated that this time interval is an accurate predictor of nectar volumes in flowers. We found that nectar rewards influence the probability of departure from individual plants, as well as distances of movements within plants. The probability of departure from individual plants was negatively related to the amount of reward received at the two last-visited flowers. This result indicates that the bees used a probabilistic departure rule, rather than a simple threshold departure rule, and that rewards from both the current and the previously visited flower were important in determining departure points. Distances of inter-flower movements within plants were negatively related to the amount of reward received at the current flower. The overall results suggest that the pollinators of A. strigosa make two types of departure decisions - departures from the whole plant and departures from the neighbourhood of individual flowers - and that they use different departure rules for each scale.

Direct calorimetric results of this paper are compared with data of indirect calorimetry from the literature using a respiratory quotient of 1.00 and 21.13 J consumed. Agreements between both methods are generally good. The results show that weight-specific heat production rates increase with age of worker bees by a factor of 5.6 at 30-degrees-C, 3.7 at 25-degrees-C and 40.0 at 20-degrees-C. In groups of foragers the heat production decreases with growing group size to around 6% of the value for an isolated bee. The presence of a fertile queen or of brood reduces the heat output of a small worker group significantly. Adult drones exhibit a much higher metabolic rate (up to 19.7-fold at 20-degrees-C) than juveniles with strong fluctuations in the power-time curves. Fertile queens show a less pronounced heat production rate than virgin queens (54% at 30-degrees-C, 87% at 25-degrees-C and 77% at 20-degrees-C). Calorimetric unrest is much higher for young than for adult queens. Heat production is very low in both uncapped and capped brood and less than 30% of that of a newly emerged worker.

In nest-building wasps there is a continuum from species that provision each offspring cell with one large prey item (single provisioning) to species that provision each cell with many small items (multiple provisioning). The significance of number of prey per cell was examined during two seasons in Ammophila sabulosa (L.), a species that provisions between one and five caterpillars per cell. 2. There was no difference between the total weight of prey in singly-provisioned and multiply-provisioned cells: individual caterpillars placed in multiply-provisioned cells were smaller. 3. Small caterpillars were captured and transported to the nest faster than large ones. 4. If the first prey provisioned was large, the cell was usually then permanently closed. If the first prey was small, additional prey were captured, and females appeared to become more selective: additional prey were rarely large. 5. It is suggested that the flexible provisioning strategy used by A. sabulosa allows a wide range of prey sizes to be utilized without affecting maternal control of offspring size and sex. This could be important when available prey sizes vary temporally and spatially. 6. There was a male-biased first generation investment ratio. Female-producing cells were provisioned with a higher total prey weight than male-producing cells, and conversion of prey weight to adult weight was more efficient for females. 7. Total prey weight provisioned is probably a good indirect measure of parental time investment in A. sabulosa. Other measures, particularly number of prey provisioned, will be less accurate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,,,,,FEB,1992,17,1,,,,,43,51,,10.1111/j.1365-2311.1992.tb01037.x,,,,,,,WOS:A1992HL13100006,,,,,

Altitudinal range occupied by species was related to species distribution, but the most important variable accounting for species distribution was the local percentage abundance. Despite this, there was no evidence for bimodality in the distributions of species incidence. A general trend for mean proboscis length in each locality to be greater in lowland localities exists, but this variable was not related to species distribution or abundance. Proboscis length spacings were studied among species in local assemblages and in most of the cases observed spacing did not differ from random expectations.

Rates of interpatch siring of seeds of pistillate plants (females) averaged 20.4% (range 8.6% - 40%) for the three patches examined. Heterogeneity among fruits in seeds sired by interpatch pollen indicates that the arrival of interpatch pollen is clumped with respect to stigmas. Within patches, plants of the same sex type usually shared identical five-locus genotypes, suggesting that clonal propagation predominates. Since approximately 90% of seeds are sired by intrapatch pollen, seeds of monoecious plants appear to result primarily from geitonogamous (self-) fertilization.

Two of the colonies (colonies 1 & 2) migrated during the study period, while the remaining two (colonies 3 & 4) did not. During the 4-6 weeks preceding the onset of migration preparations. colonies 1 & 2 exhibited increasing population sizes, high levels of brood production with low brood mortality, relatively large stores of food, and increasing mass. In contrast, the populations of colonies 3 & 4 did not increase. brood-rearing activity was erratic and lower, brood mortality was higher, food stores became depleted and colony mass declined. Both colonies 3 & 4 ceased rearing brood, and colony 3 died of starvation. Colony foraging activity was examined by monitoring waggle-dance activity 2-3 days each week. For 4-6 weeks before the onset of migration in colonies 1 & 2, daily foraging areas and mean daily foraging distances became increasingly large and variable. Colonies 3 & 4 exhibited foraging patterns similar to those observed for colonies 1 & 2 preceding migration. There was no clear association between 7 weather parameters examined and migration behavior. These data suggest that migration is influenced by an interaction of intra-colony demographics, food reserves and foraging patterns. Migration may be feasible only for those colonies that possess (1) a population of appropriate size and age structure to compensate for the natural attrition of older workers during the emigration process, and (2) sufficient food reserves for long-distance travel and the establishment of a new nest. Changing foraging patterns may reflect a deteriorating foraging environment, which may trigger the onset of migration preparations, provided that colony demographics and food reserves are conducive. Colonies that show decreased brood production, higher brood mortality and reduced food stores may be incapable of migrating, even when experiencing deteriorating foraging conditions.

Transient males left the territory soon after the territorial male flew back and forth in front of the perch tree in a zig-zag flight. The alternative behaviors were correlated with wing wear such that males with little wing wear defended territories and males with considerable wing wear pursued a transient strategy. Behavior patterns were not correlated with head width. Comparison of territory trees with the territory trees of a closely related species indicate that each species utilized trees of a certain diameter class for perching.

The wall on either side carried a visual pattern. When the patterns were stationary vertical gratings, bees tended to fly through the middle of the tunnel, i.e. along its longitudinal axis. However, when one of the gratings was in motion, bees flying in the same direction as the moving grating tended to fly closer to it, while bees flying in the opposite direction tended to fly closer to the stationary grating. This demonstrates, directly and unequivocally, that flying bees estimate the distances of surfaces in terms of the apparent motion of their images. A series of further experiments revealed that the distance to the gratings is gauged in terms of their apparent angular speeds, and that the visual system of the bee is capable of measuring angular speed largely independently of the spatial period, intensity profile, or contrast of the grating.

A plant whose pollinia had been labelled with C-14 was placed within a large population of milkweeds and a single subject umbel was exposed to honey-bee pollinators for 5 days. Hand pollinations involving another umbel on this plant verified that labelled pollinia dispersed to flowers within the umbel (geitonogamy), or to flowers on other plants, could be detected by scintillation counts. The labelled plant was at the centre of a 6 x 6 m study plot. Of the 38 insertions on the labelled umbel, 14 (37%) were from the labelled umbel itself (geitonogamy). Thirty labelled pollinia were detected in umbels on neighbouring plants within the study plot. It is estimated that few labelled pollinia were inserted into flowers outside of the study plot, although the possibility of some long-distance dispersal cannot be excluded. The results indicate that much of the pollen dispersal was short distance. This makes pollen dispersal characteristics in this species similar to those of non-milkweed species.

Erickson (1982, 1983) shows their involvement in the odor receptor efficiency of honey bee antenna. Also, the author suggests the importance of charges in the transfer of pollen grains from flowers to pollinator insects. To measure directly electric charges, we fit a sensor used to determine the charges of raindrops. Strongly clustered wintering bees and foraging bees were measured. The individual values range between -400pC to +600pC (m = 153 +/- 105pC) during winter time. The foraging bees possess variable charges, generally smaller than wintering bees (m = 29 +/- 40pC). 7.0% of measured bees whole are charged negatively and less than 1% of these have no charges. The presence of electric charges throughout bees yearly cycle is significant for the insect society. Moreover electric forces contribute to explain some aspects of bee-parasite relationships.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0730-823X,,,,,,1991,10,1-Feb,,,,,17,32,,10.3109/15368379109031397,,,,,,,WOS:A1991GY84300002,,,,,

This study begins to evaluate how octopuses navigate, and whether they can use visual landmarks. Paths of Octopus vulgaris were observed in the field as they foraged and responded to displacements. Octopus rubescens were trained to orient to a beacon in the laboratory, and response to its displacement was monitored. 2. Octopuses foraged using chemotactile exploration but did not retrace their outgoing paths. 3. Octopuses learned to orient to a beacon for a food reward, and oriented directly to it when it was moved 90-degrees each day. 4. When a three-landmark array was presented to one octopus it oriented first to the largest landmark, then to the beacon. It responded to movement of one or more landmarks suggesting both orienting to this conspicuous landmark and going to where the beacon ought to have been. 5. The lack of disruption of octopuses' return home in the field by movement of an artificial landmark, the significant prediction of whether they would eat away from home by distance from the home, and their ease of return home when they were displaced by territorial fish, in combination with the lab data, suggested that octopuses can and do use a long-term memory of a visual landmark array.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-7594,,,,,,1991,168,4,,,,,491,497,,10.1007/BF00199609,,,,,,,WOS:A1991FK53100010,,,,,

Wing oscillation frequencies were recorded from dancing bees after they had visited a feeding station located from 50 to 1600 m from the hive. The bees vibrated their wings more rapidly after they visited nearby stations than when they foraged at more distant feeding stations. For example, the mean frequency of 315 Hz at 50 m dropped to only 207 Hz at 1600 m. Wing vibration frequency appears to be another factor to be added to the elements in the dance known to indicate the distance bees must fly to food sources. These known elements include the duration of the straight run and the number of wagtail movements in the run.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0892-7553,,,,,JAN,1991,4,1,,,,,15,20,,10.1007/BF01092547,,,,,,,WOS:A1991EX39000002,,,,,

I compared load size for ants cutting thin leaves (starfruit, Averrhoa carambola) and thick leaves (grapefruit, Citrus parodist). At each source, larger ants cut larger fragments. Distance from the nest had no effect on load size. The mass of fragments cut by an ant of a given size was significantly greater when cutting grapefruit leaves. The leaf area cut, however, showed no significant difference between the two leaf types. Leaf area increased approximately in proportion to ant body mass to the 0.6 power. As a result of their method of load-size determination, ants of a given size cut heavier loads when cutting the thicker leaves. This difference, however, was counteracted at the colony level by recruitment of larger ants, which cut smaller area fragments relative to their body mass, to cut at thicker leaf sources.

The bees moved nonrandomly with respect to direction, zigzagging along a westerly-southeasterly path by foraging from the most ""conspicuous"" plants which were those with the tallest spikes and longest inflorescences. Spike height and inflorescence length were highly correlated both with the number of bee visits to individual plants and to each other. Bee visits were less influenced by the number of open flowers and the distances between neighboring plants. The bees performed nonrepeated foraging sequences 80% of the time, yet intensely revisited four of the most ""conspicuous"" plants. Repeated foraging sequences (20%) similarly involved many revisits to the most ""conspicuous"" plants. Thus, plant conspicuousness was the overriding factor that ""lured"" the bees to forage directionally in a patch of sparsely situated plants where revisits to the same plants occurred at higher rates than might have been optimal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0008-3550,,,,,OCT-DEC,1990,104,4,,,,,519,525,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1990FL12900001,,,,,

Both honeybee and leafcutter bee positive-foragers moved laterally between rows more often than along rows. The bees moved to rows with different cultivars more frequently that to rows with the same cultivar. However, the direction of movement and cultivar preference did not differ significantly between the two species of bees. Honeybees foraged in greater numbers, and on more flowers per bee than did leafcutter bees. The amount of movement also varied with the cultivars that were used. Few bees moved between the cultivars that differed greatly in appearance and growth habit (e.g. Aladin and 15025). The amount of movement between the cultivars Aladin and CM4 was much higher, ranging from 27 to 43 percent in honeybees and 22 percent in leafcutter bees.

Birds and bees were induced to forage in an aviary and the resulting carryover of pollen and fluorescent dye powder from an initial male-phase donor flower to emasculated female-phase recipients was compared. Bumble-bee visitation caused dye transfer whose properites closely resembled those of pollen transfer on average, while hummingbird visitation caused more variable deposition of dye and pollen on recipients and longer distances of pollen than of dye movement on average. The last result implies that pollen dispersal and genetic neighbourhood area are more extensive than estimated previously from dye dispersal in D. nelsonii populations. Pollen transfer in this species also is comparable to that in two sympatric herbs, Ipomopsis aggregata (Pursh) V.
