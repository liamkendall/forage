However, there have been few comparisons of the effectiveness of different types of field-margin pollinator habitat in maintaining bee diversity and pollination of the focal crops. We compared wild bee abundance, species richness and community composition between strawberry crops bordered by hedgerows, and those bordered by larger expanses of natural land (forests). Strawberry is an ideal crop in which to investigate pollinator export from field margins as the rows are covered with straw, which reduces habitat for ground-nesting bees within the crop; thus, most wild pollinators need to enter the crop from the margins. We sampled bees in six strawberry fields with hedgerow margins and six strawberry fields with forested margins of at least 200 m in length, using a paired design. We examined strawberry pollen deposition at regular intervals into the fields, and the magnitude of pollinator export from the field margins towards the centre of the crops. We found that bees as a group were no more species-rich or abundant in crops bordered by forests than in crops bordered by hedgerows, although large-bodied bees were more abundant in the former than the latter. Regardless of field-margin type, we found that small wild bee abundance declined significantly from the edge to the centre of the crop, but honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) and large-bodied bee abundance did not. Strawberry pollen deposition also did not decline with distance into the crop. Although previous work indicates that small wild bees are more effective (yield-increasing) pollinators of strawberry on a per-visit basis, their limited foraging ranges suggest they may only pollinate areas near the crop margins, given typical field sizes in our area. © 2020 Gesellschaft für Ökologie",Article,Scopus

Temporal and spatial variation of flower resources affects foraging decisions of wild and honey bees. To optimise crop pollination management a better understanding of potential competition for pollinators in mass- and minor-flowering crops is needed. We combined waggle dance decoding, pollen load analysis and field surveys to identify the habitat preferences and pollen use of honey bees in response to spatio-temporal changes in resource availability. Observation hives were placed on the edge of eleven fields of blooming strawberries (mean 2.24 ha) located in landscapes with different amounts of oilseed rape (OSR), semi-natural habitats (SNH) and apple trees in Germany. In addition, we surveyed honey bees and wild bees in strawberry fields. Honey bee dances more often indicated strawberry, OSR fields and SNH than expected given their landscape-wide areas. Honey bees collected on average 7.9 % strawberry, 49.0 % OSR, 30.2 % Pyrus type (e.g. apple) and 12.9 % other pollen types. The mean honey bee foraging distance was 740 m, and decreased with OSR availability. In the observation hives, dances for strawberry fields were not directly affected by OSR availability or SNH land cover. But large amounts of OSR reduced overall honey bee and bumble bee abundance in strawberry fields, while solitary bees were unaffected. Bumble bees were most abundant in strawberry fields (54.1%) and together with solitary bees (19.7%) they represented about 75.0% of the observed bees. Minor-flowering strawberry fields represent a preferred resource for honey bees, especially for small colonies as indicated by decoding of waggle dances. However, the availability of more attractive OSR and local strawberry flower cover moderates the abundance of social bees (honey bees and bumble bees) in strawberry fields while other wild bees were less affected. Hence, we conclude that wild bee conservation plays a major role for strawberry pollination. If pollination services by solitary bees are limited, small honey bee hives can be used scrupulously to supplement pollination services in strawberries. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

Honey bees use visual attributes of the targeted food source, such as its color, shape, size, direction and distance from the hive, and the landmarks around it to navigate during foraging. They transmit the location information of the food source to other bees if it is highly rewarding. To investigate the relative importance of these attributes, we trained bees to feeders in two different experiments. In the first experiment, we asked whether bees prefer to land on (a) a similar feeder at a different distance on the same heading or on (b) a visually distinct feeder located at the exact same location. We found that, within a short foraging range, bees relied heavily on the color and the shape of the food source and to a lesser extent on its distance from the hive. In the second experiment, we asked if moving the main landmark or the feeder (visual target) influenced recruitment dancing for the feeder. We found that foragers took longer to land and danced fewer circuits when the location of the food source, or a major landmark associated with it, changed. These results demonstrate that prominent visual attributes of food sources and landmarks are evidently more reliable than distance information and that foraging bees heavily utilize these visual cues at the later stages of their journey. © 2018 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences",Article,Scopus

Although, communal gardens were primarily intended to provide fresh, regional food to denizens, these green islands also host a surprisingly high number of wild bee species. The gardens were characterized based on structural elements such as flower frequency, the relative percentage of lawn, trees, shrubs, planted crops and infrastructure (e.g. seating possibilities or garden houses). Further, the effects of different landscape structures surrounding the gardens and distance to the city center were analyzed on the total wild bee species richness and functional traits. Focusing on these putative influencing factors, statistical analyses calculating random decision forests along with generalized linear mixed models were applied. With 113 observed wild bee species, communal gardens provide habitat for a quarter of all known species in Vienna. In conclusion, results revealed that only elements within the gardens had an effect on species richness, with flower frequency as the major positive driver. The examined communal gardens promote and conserve wild bees independent from the location within the city or garden size. Furthermore, these green patches are important sanctuaries, hosting rare and threatened species as well as remarkably special wild bee communities. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Scopus

Moreover, eye design represents a balance between often conflicting requirements for gathering different forms of visual information. The trade-off between spatial resolving power and contrast sensitivity is common to all visual systems, and European honeybees (Apis mellifera) present an important opportunity to better understand this trade-off. Vision has been studied extensively in A. mellifera as it is vital for foraging, navigation and communication. Consequently, spatial resolving power and contrast sensitivity in A. mellifera have been measured using several methodologies; however, there is considerable variation in estimates between methodologies. We assess pattern electroretinography (pERG) as a new method for assessing the trade-off between visual spatial and contrast information in A. mellifera. pERG has the benefit of measuring spatial contrast sensitivity from higher order visual processing neurons in the eye. Spatial resolving power of A. mellifera estimated from pERG was 0.54 cycles per degree (cpd), and contrast sensitivity was 16.9. pERG estimates of contrast sensitivity were comparable to previous behavioural studies. Estimates of spatial resolving power reflected anatomical estimates in the frontal region of the eye, which corresponds to the region stimulated by pERG. Apis mellifera has similar spatial contrast sensitivity to other hymenopteran insects with similar facet diameter (Myrmecia ant species). Our results support the idea that eye anatomy has a substantial effect on spatial contrast sensitivity in compound eyes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

Honeybees (genus Apis) are unique in that they communicate the spatial information of resources using a symbolic 'language', the waggle dance. Different honeybee species differ in foraging ecology but it remains unknown whether this shaped variation in the dance. We studied distance dialects-interspecific differences in how waggle duration relates to flight distance-and tested the hypothesis that these evolved to maximize communication precision over the bees' foraging ranges. We performed feeder experiments with Apis cerana, A. florea and A. dorsata in India and found that A. cerana had the steepest dialect, i.e. a rapid increase in waggle duration with increasing feeder distance, A. florea had an intermediate, and A. dorsata had the lowest dialect. By decoding dances for natural food sites, we inferred that the foraging range was smallest in A. cerana, intermediate in A. florea and largest in A. dorsata. The inverse correlation between foraging range and dialect was corroborated when comparing six (sub)species across the geographical range of the genus including previously published data.

However, few studies show how landscapes composition and configuration can impact the pollen foraging of bees. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate how landscape structure and local characteristics can influence the pollen foraging patterns of the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides in agricultural landscapes of Chapada Diamantina, a region of the Bahia state in Brazil. Methods: Pollen samples were collected from fourteen M. quadrifasciata anthidioides colonies to evaluate how pollen collection varies according to different proportions of human land-use, landscape heterogeneity, plant richness and distance from crops. To explain the richness and diversity of pollen collected by bees, we used generalized linear models, and linear models, compared through the Akaike information criteria corrected for small samples (AICc). Results: Pollen richness can be explained by the distance from crops, plant richness and human land-use proportion. Bees will collect pollen from more plant species when they are in a natural and diverse landscape.

In cropping environments, especially monoculture systems, pollinators that travel between plants or rows may increase cross-pollination and consequently crop yield. However, the most commonly utilized crop pollinator, Apis mellifera L., tends to forage consecutively on nearest-neighbouring plants within rows. The level of cross-pollination can be further restricted in crops that are propagated by cloning. When a clonal variety is planted over large areas, the potential for outcrossed pollen deposition could be limited, regardless of pollinator flight distances. To investigate how pollinator movement and varietal diversity interact to affect crop pollination, we conducted an experiment with wild and honey bees in single- and multiple-variety strawberry fields. We hypothesized that the amount of cross-pollination provided by wild bees in multiple-variety strawberry fields would be greater than in single-variety fields, and greater than that provided by honey bees in either field type. We found that, indeed, flowers visited by wild bees produced larger strawberries than those visited by honey bees in multiple-variety plots, but only in the more self-incompatible of the two strawberry varieties tested. Strawberries resulting from honey bee pollination were of similar size regardless of the number of varieties planted in the field. Our results show that certain multiple-variety strawberry fields can benefit from the irregular foraging patterns of some solitary bee species, leading to increased cross-pollination and crop yield. Strawberry growers could take advantage of this effect by planting multiple varieties in close proximity and by supporting wild bee populations on farms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

However, museums specimens also contain important ecological information, including rarely measured morphological traits. Trait-based assessments of museums specimens provide additional information on underlying mechanisms of population trends, by tracking changes over time. Here, we used museum specimens of four Bombus species, spanning a timeframe of 125 years to: (i) compare body size of declining and increasing species, (ii) assess intra-specific trends over the last century, and (iii) investigate shifts in geographical distribution over time. We found that declining Bombus species were larger than increasing ones. All four species were smaller in current time than a century ago. Intra-specific size declines were more pronounced for larger-bodied species. With our sampling, declining and increasing species showed an upward shift in elevation, and declining species showed an additional geographic shift in recent times as compared to historic records.

In order to understand the foraging behaviour of honey bee colonies and preference among the available floral resources, pollen collections from three experimental healthy colonies of honey bees were analysed in the month of June. Results: The amount of pollen collections were related to the colony's need which was indicated by the number of larval and adult bees present in the hive. Interesting was the sequence of pollen collection from different floral sources. All honey bee colonies collected pollens from Trifolium repens first, then Erigeron annus and the third choice was Coreopsis drummondii and Oenothera biennis flowers. Total protein content of Trifolium pollen was the highest (20.0 g/100 g DM), and the others were in the range of 8.9-11.4 g/100 g DM.

V. velutina represents a serious threat to native pollinators. It is known to be a fierce predator of honey bees, but can also hunt wild bees, native wasps, and other flying insects. When V. velutina colonies are developed, many hornets capture foraging bees which are coming back to their hives, causing an increase in homing failure and paralysis of foraging thus leading to colony collapse. The hornets may enter weak beehives to prey on brood and pillage honey. Unlike Apis cerana, Apis mellifera is unable to cope with the predation pressure of V. velutina.

This study seeks to evaluate whether, how and why wide-spectrum Beauveria bassiana insecticides are safe to honey bees in a novel assessment system. RESULTS: Mesonotum dipping with a 108 conidia ml−1 suspension and body contact with conidial suspension in sucrose solution caused high mortalities of adult forager bees at 25 °C optimal for conidial germination and hyphal invasion. Intriguingly, colony sizes in the hives contaminated by the forager bees contacting viable and inactivated conidia at two sites (1.2 km in distance), respectively, showed similar increase percentages (31.7% versus 29.2%) during a 4-week summer period of exposure to environment. No sign of fungal infection was found within each of the monitored colonies. Neither was fungal outgrowth observed on surfaces of bee cadavers cleaned from each hive at either site. Hourly counts of cleaned cadavers from videotapes presented no significant difference in colony-cleaning behavior between the two sites.

Yet, the extra mass results in an increase of energetic expenditure for flight. Thus, bees should tune their fuel loads to the respective foraging situation. In the present study, we investigated the fuel adjustment in the Brazilian stingless bee Melipona subnitida (Apidae, Meliponini). Specifically, we examined whether foragers of this species increase their fuel loads when they have low expectation for nectar collection during a foraging trip. Crop load measurements revealed that nectar foragers carried significantly less fuel on departing the nest than foragers collecting either pollen, clay, or resin. Surprisingly, 75% of nectar foragers left the nest without any detectable amount of nectar, which suggests that the majority of bees collected at nearby nectar sources and avoided an increase in foraging costs.

While the majority of phytophagous insects is highly host specific, generalist behavior is quite widespread among bees and presumably involves physiological adaptations that remain largely unexplored. However, floral visitation patterns suggest that generalist bees do not forage randomly on all available resources. While resource availability and accessibility as well as nectar composition have been widely explored, pollen chemistry could also have an impact on the range of suitable host-plants. This study focuses on particular pollen nutrients that cannot be synthesized de novo by insects but are key compounds of cell membranes and the precursor for molting process: the sterols. We compared the sterol composition of pollen from the main host-plants of three generalist bees: Anthophora plumipes, Colletes cunicularius, and Osmia cornuta, as well as one specialist bee Andrena vaga. We also analyzed the sterols of their brood cell provisions, the tissues of larvae and nonemerged females to determine which sterols are used by the different species. Our results show that sterols are not used accordingly to foraging strategy: Both the specialist species A. vaga and the generalist species C. cunicularius might metabolize a rare C27 sterol, while the two generalist species A. plumipes and O. cornuta might rather use a very common C28 sterol. Our results suggest that shared sterolic compounds among plant species could facilitate the exploitation of multiple host-plants by A. plumipes and O. cornuta whereas the generalist C. cunicularius might be more constrained due to its physiological requirements of a more uncommon dietary sterol. Our findings suggest that a bee displaying a generalist foraging behavior may sometimes hide a sterol-specialized species. This evidence challenges the hypothesis that all generalist free-living bee species are all able to develop on a wide range of different pollen types. © 2019 The Authors.

Here we demonstrate for the first time that honeybees can also be exposed to pharmaceuticals, commonly present in wastewater. Residues of carbamazepine (an anti-epileptic drug) up to 371 ng/mL and 30 µg/g were detected in nectar and pollen sampled from zucchini flowers (Cucurbita pepo) grown in carbamazepine spiked soil (0.5–20 µg/g). Under realistic exposure conditions from the use of recycled wastewater, carbamazepine concentrations were estimated to be 0.37 ng/L and 30 ng/kg in nectar and pollen, respectively. Incorporation of environmentally relevant carbamazepine residues in nectar and pollen into a modelling framework able to simulate beehive dynamics including the honeybee foraging activity at the landscape scale (BEEHAVE and BEESCOUT) enabled the simulation of carbamazepine translocation from zucchini fields into honeybee hives. Carbamazepine accumulation was modelled in 11 beehives across a 25 km2 landscape over three years chosen to represent distinct climatic conditions. During a single flowering period, carbamazepine concentrations were simulated to range between 0 and 2478 ng per beehive. The amount of carbamazepine gathered not only varied across the simulated years but there were also differences in accumulation of carbamazepine between beehives within the same year. This work illustrates a fundamental first step in assessing the risk of pharmaceuticals to bees through realistic scenarios by demonstrating a method to quantify potential exposure of honeybees at the landscape scale. Pharmaceuticals are being inadvertently but increasingly applied to agricultural lands globally via the use of wastewater for agricultural irrigation in response to water scarcity problems. We have demonstrated a route of pharmaceutical exposure to honeybees via contaminated nectar and pollen. Given the biological potency of pharmaceuticals, accumulation of these chemicals in nectar and pollen suggest potential implications for honeybee health, with unknown ecosystem consequences. © 2019 The Authors",Article,Scopus

The effects of this exposure at plant community level are unknown and difficult to assess in a scientifically appropriate manner. Such an assessment can be scientifically adequate if a studied plant community is completely new and control-impact radiation treatment is used. In this review we aimed to predict ecological effects and identify indicators of the impact of bioactive RF-EMFs at the mobile telephony frequency range on plant communities. We considered the scenario where a plant community was exposed to radiation generated by a base transmitting station antenna mounted on a nearby mast. This plant community can be represented by mesic meadow, ruderal or arable weed community, or other herbaceous, moderately productive vegetation type. We concentrated primarily on radiation effects that can be recorded for a year since the exposure started. To predict them we used physical theories of radiowave propagation in vegetation and the knowledge on plants physiological responses to RF-EMF. Our indicators can be used for the detection of the impact of RF-EMFs on vegetation in a control-impact experiment. The identified indicators can be classified into the following groups: (1) canopy parameters; (2) plant characteristics to be measured in the field or laboratory in a number of individuals that represent the populations of selected species; (3) community weighted means/medians (CWMs) of plant traits and strategies; (4) the abundance of other organisms that interact with plants and can influence their fitness or population size. The group of canopy parameters includes mean height, vertical vegetation structure and dry weight of above-ground standing phytomass. Plant characteristics requiring biometric sampling in the field are plant height, the number of fruits and seeds, as well as seed viability. The group of plant traits that are calculated as CWMs covers seed releasing height, seed dispersal mode, SLA, leaf orientation, month of germination and flowering, Ellenberg's light indicator value, and the proportion of individuals in the classes of competitors and stress tolerators according to Grime's CSR strategy scheme. The group of “non-plant” indicators includes primarily the frequency of flower visits by beetles, wasps, hoverflies, and bees that have their nests over ground. To detect ecological responses that occur for the first year since a herbaceous community has been exposed to potentially bioactive RF-EMF, the first two indicators groups should be used. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Review,Scopus

No previous study has reported such a finding in adult insect locomotion. We used behavioural tracking to study walking Bombus terrestris in an arena under different training environments. Trajectories analysed from this tracking show the speed-curvature power law holds robustly at the population level, displaying an exponent close to two-thirds. This exponent corroborates previous findings in human movement patterns, but differs from the three-quarter exponent reported for Drosophila larval locomotion. There are conflicting hypotheses for the principal origin of these speed-curvature laws, ranging from the role of central planning to kinematic and muscular skeletal constraints. Our findings substantiate the latter idea that dynamic power-law effects are robust, differing only through kinematic constraints due to locomotive method. Our research supports the notion that these laws are present in a greater range of species than previously thought, even in the bumblebee. Such power laws may provide optimal behavioural templates for organisms, delivering a potential analytical tool to study deviations from this template. Our results suggest that curvature and angular speed are constrained geometrically, and independently of the muscles and nerves of the performing body. © 2020 James et al.

Bumblebees are important pollinators in temperate, sub-arctic, and Alpine regions, but many species are in decline across the globe. Agri-environment schemes have been designed to support female bumblebees, but free-living males may also need support. Male bumblebees have an energetically expensive lifestyle, and so understanding their foraging choices may provide a first step towards designing interventions to support them in the wild. Using a series of controlled laboratory choice experiments, we demonstrate that males prefer sugar concentrations of between 50 and 60% when under either simple (binary) or complex (octanary) choice conditions when presented with a broad range of sugar concentrations. When presented with concentrations within this preferred range, males exhibit a clear preference for sugar solutions of 56% w/w sucrose when solutions differ by 4%. These results suggest that males maximise their rate of energy intake, as predicted by theoretical models, rather than minimise their water consumption. In the future, male preferences for high sugar concentrations can be combined with knowledge of baseline nectar concentrations and flower phenology to maximise the value of conservation interventions for this neglected sex. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,Scopus

Molecular studies have estimated that bumblebee colonies can be established many kilometers from their queens’ natal nest site. However, little is known about when and how queens disperse during their lifespan. One possible life stage when dispersal may occur, is directly after emerging from hibernation. Here, harmonic radar tracking of artificially over-wintered Bombus terrestris queens shows that they spend most of their time resting on the ground with intermittent very short flights (duration and distance). We corroborate these behaviors with observations of wild queen bees, which show similar prolonged resting periods between short flights, indicating that the behavior of our radar-monitored bees was not due to the attachment of transponders nor an artifact of the bees being commercially reared. Radar-monitored flights were not continuously directed away from the origin, suggesting that bees were not intentionally trying to disperse from their artificial emergence site. Flights did not loop back to the origin suggesting bees were not trying to remember or get back to the original release site. Most individuals dispersed from the range of the harmonic radar within less than two days and did not return. Flight directions were not different from a uniform distribution and flight lengths followed an exponential distribution, both suggesting random dispersal. A random walk model based on our observed data estimates a positive net dispersal from the origin over many flights, indicating a biased random dispersal, and estimates the net displacement of queens to be within the range of those estimated in genetic studies. We suggest that a distinct post-hibernation life history stage consisting mostly of rest with intermittent short flights and infrequent foraging fulfils the dual purpose of ovary development and dispersal prior to nest searching. © 2019, The Author(s).",Article,Scopus

Recent evidence suggests that the US Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has a positive impact on environmental suitability for supporting honey bee apiaries. However, relatively little is known about the influence of habitat conservation efforts on honey bee colony health. Identifying specific factors that influence bee health at the colony level incorporates longitudinal monitoring of physiology across diverse environments. Using a pooled-sampling method to overcome individual variation, we monitored colony-level molecular biomarkers during critical pre- and post-winter time points. Major categories of colony health (nutrition, oxidative stress resistance, and immunity) were impacted by apiary site. In general, apiaries within foraging distance of CRP lands showed improved performance and higher gene expression of vitellogenin (vg), a nutritionally regulated protein with central storage and regulatory functions. Mirroring vg levels, gene transcripts encoding antioxidant enzymes and immune-related proteins were typically higher in colonies exposed to CRP environments. Our study highlights the potential of CRP lands to improve pollinator health and the utility of colony-level molecular diagnostics to assess environmental suitability for honey bees. © 2019, The Author(s).",Article,Scopus

Therefore, a grade 1 score indicates a minimal and easily reversible lesion, increased apocrine secretion, increased cell elimination into the lumen, and a larger quantity of spherocrystals; grade 2 was assigned to moderate and typically reversible injuries, such as changes in the brush border, vacuolation/loss of cytoplasmic material, presence/height of the brush border, and cell swelling; and grade 3 was assigned to serious and irreversible, loss of cell nests of regenerative cells, pyknosis, and loss of contact between Kenyon cells.

However, there are a great many different plant cultivars available to the gardener, and a paucity of evidence-based advice as to which plants are truly most attractive to flower-visiting insects. Here, we report insect visitation to metre square plots of 111 different ornamental plant cultivars at a site in central UK. Data were collected over 5 years, and comprise over 9000 insect observations, which were identified to species (for honeybees and bumblebees) or as ‘solitary bees’, Syrphidae, Lepidoptera and ‘others’. Unlike some previous studies, we found no difference in numbers of insects attracted to native or non-native species, or according to whether plants were annuals, biennials or perennials, but we did find that native plants attracted a significantly higher diversity of flower-visiting insects. Overall, the most-visited plants were Calamintha nepeta, Helenium autumnale and Geranium rozanne. However, patterns of visitation were quite different for every insect taxa examined. For example, different species of short-tongued bumblebees showed little overlap in their most-preferred plant cultivars. Interestingly, very similar plant cultivars often attracted different insect communities; for example, 72% of visitors to Aster novi belgii were honeybees or bumblebees, while the related Anthemis tinctoria, which also has daisy-like flowers, did not attract a single honeybee or bumblebee but was popular with solitary bees, hoverflies, and ‘other’ pollinators. Some plant cultivars such as Eryngium planum and Myosotis arvensis were attractive to a broad range of insects, while others attracted only a few species but sometimes in large numbers, such as Veronicastrum virginicum and Helenium autumnale which were both visited predominantly by honey bees. It is clear that we do not yet fully understand what factors drive insect flower preferences. Recommendations are made as to which flower cultivars could be combined to provide forage for a diversity of pollinator groups over the season from early spring to autumn, though it must be born in mind that some plants are likely to perform differently when grown in different environmental conditions. © 2019, The Author(s).",Article,Scopus

We examined conspecific and heterospecific interactions between honeybees foraging at the nectar- and pollen-providing flowers of Antipogon leptopus (Polygonaceae). We cross-classified 554 encounters by three variables; incoming bee species, resident bee species, and one of four potential responses: (1) incoming defers to resident; (2) incoming procures the flower from resident; (3) incoming and resident share the flower; or (4) both incoming and resident abandon the flower. We also measured aggression and foraging rates of workers at flowers. Both species visited similar numbers of flowers in a foraging bout and spent similar foraging times on individual flowers. Incoming A. mellifera were more likely to procure flowers from resident A. cerana, and incoming A. cerana were more likely to defer to resident A. mellifera. A. mellifera were more aggressive toward heterospecifics than conspecifics, with heterospecifics 4.5 times more likely to provoke an aggressive response. However, no significant difference between conspecific and heterospecific aggression was observed for incoming A. cerana.

We carried out three independent experiments to study the impact of acute oral treatment of 20 μL TMX at concentrations of 2.4 ppb (0.048 ng/bee) and 10 ppb (0.2 ng/bee) on the homing, flight, learning acquisition and short-term retention ability of A. cerana. The homing ability was assessed by the catch-and-release method, the flight ability was assessed by flight mills, and the learning acquisition and short-term retention were evaluated by the proboscis extension response method. Results: When treated with 10 ppb of TMX, bees had a significantly higher average homing time, mean flight velocity, flying distance, and flying duration than the control, whereas 2.4 ppb concentration did not cause any significant effect on homing or flight ability. Bees treated with either 2.4 ppb or 10 ppb TMX had significantly lower learning acquisition and short-term retention ability. Conclusion: Results suggest that acute oral exposure to 10 ppb of TMX altered the short-distance homing time, flight ability, and learning acquisition and short-term retention ability. Our study also highlights the concern that acute oral exposure to a low concentration of 2.4 ppb could have consequences on the behavior of A. creana.

Restored prairie supported 2× more species (95 of 119 total species) and 3× more bees (72% of captured individuals) compared to the other cover types. All richness and abundance differences among habitat types were associated with higher floral resources in restored prairie. Thirty percent of the bee species were unique to prairie, consistent with long-distance dispersal but begging the question of origin given the absence of prairie regionally. Our results suggest that road and field edges may be the source, as these areas had more floral and nesting resources than forest or crop fields combined and supported 55% of all species despite covering only approximately 5% of the sampled farms. Habitat scarcity is not the only constraint on native bees in agricultural landscapes, with increasing concern over disease and chemicals. However, we observed that restored areas on marginal lands of conventional farms can support abundant and species-rich populations of native bees. © 2019 Society for Ecological Restoration",Article,Scopus

However, spatial and temporal patterns in the availability and quantity of these resources can be affected by disturbances like wildfire. The potential for spatial or temporal separation of foraging and nesting resources is of particular concern for solitary wood-cavity-nesting bees as they are central-place, short-distance foragers once they have established their nest. Often the importance of nesting resources for bees have been tested by sampling foraging bees as a proxy, and nesting bees have rarely been studied in a community context, particularly postdisturbance. We tested how wood-cavity-nesting bee species richness, nesting success, and nesting and floral resources varied across gradients of wildfire severity and time-since-burn. We sampled nesting bees via nesting boxes within four wildfires in southwest Montana, USA, using a space-for-time substitution chronosequence approach spanning 3–25 years postburn and including an unburned control. We found that bee nesting success and species richness declined with increasing time postburn, with a complete lack of successful bee nesting in unburned areas. Nesting and floral resources were highly variable across both burn severity and time-since-burn, yet generally did not have strong effects on nesting success. Our results together suggest that burned areas may provide important habitat for wood-cavity-nesting bees in this system. Given ongoing fire regime shifts as well as other threats facing wild bee communities, this work helps provide essential information necessary for the management and conservation of wood-cavity-nesting bees. © 2019 The Authors.

Because accurate range information for such rare species is often limited and agricultural pesticide use patterns are dynamic, simple spatial co-occurrence methods may overestimate or underestimate overlap and result in decisions that benefit neither listed species nor the regulatory process. Here, we demonstrate a new method of co-occurrence analysis that employs probability theory to estimate spatial distribution of rare species populations and areas of pesticide use to determine the likelihood of potential exposure. Specifically, we 1) describe a probabilistic method to estimate pesticide use based on crop production patterns; 2) construct species distribution models for 2 listed insect species whose ranges were previously incompletely described, the rusty-patched bumble bee (Bombus affinis) and the Poweshiek skipperling (Oarisma poweshiek); and 3) develop a probabilistic co-occurrence methodology and assessment framework. Using the principles of the Bayes' theorem, we constructed probabilistic spatial models of pesticide use areas by integrating information from land-cover spatial data, agriculture statistics, and remote-sensing data. We used maximum entropy methods to build species distribution models for 2 listed insects based on species collection and observation records and predictor variables relevant to the species' biogeography and natural history. We further developed novel methods for refinement of these models at spatial scales relevant to US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) regulatory priorities (e.g., critical habitat areas). Integrating both probabilistic assessments and focusing on USFWS priority management areas, we demonstrate that spatial overlap (i.e., potential for exposure) is not deterministic but instead a function of both species distribution and land use patterns. Our work serves as a framework to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of threatened and endangered species assessments using a data-driven likelihood analysis of species co-occurrence.

However, effects of seasonality on foraging distances, particularly in tropical regions, are poorly understood. Here, we use translocation (‘homing’) experiments, the release of marked individuals at various distances from the nest, to investigate how homing abilities of the Neotropical stingless bee, Scaptotrigona aff. postica differ across the transition between wet and dry seasons (February–August) in a heterogenous tropical landscape in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. We also determined nectar sugar concentrations of unmanipulated returning foragers to assess temporal changes in collected resource quality. Maximum and typical homing distances (i.e. distances where 90% and 50% of released bees are lost) were estimated to be 860 and 392 m, respectively, confirming that while some individuals travel long distances, most workers must remain close to nests during foraging trips. Homing distances and collected nectar sugar concentrations showed inverse temporal patterns, as homing range declined in later months (May to August), whereas nectar sugar concentrations increased over the same period. Thus, shorter homing distances in later ‘dry season’ months probably reflected an increased availability of floral resources compared with earlier months. Together, our findings highlight the limited spatial extent of foraging activities in S. aff. postica workers, and that bee homing distances vary with environmental conditions.

The waylaying effect of pollinators is often studied at a single spatial scale; to date, little is known about the best spatial extent at which waylaying effect of pollinators can be measured. In this study, we selected a landscape with mass-flowering tufted vetches to determine the spatial scale of waylaying effect of honey bees as well as the consequence of waylaying effect on vetch pollination service. The spatial scale of waylaying effect was determined by the strongest association between honey bee density and distance, selected from a gradient of nested circular buffers centering on apiaries in three different locations. Linear models were used to predict the influence of flower visitor densities on pollination service. For our landscape, honey bee densities were best associated with distances at spatial scales of 500 m, 1150 m, and 1400 m respectively for the three locations of apiaries. Honey bee was the only pollinator whose density displayed a positive relationship with pollination service. At the scales of effect, honey bee density and pollination service declined along the distance. Our findings suggest that the waylaying effect of pollinators needs to be examined at a specific spatial scale and farmers who use honey bees to pollinate their mass-flowering crops need to consider the spatial scale of waylaying effect of pollinators in order to maximize pollination service within agricultural ecosystems. © 2019, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.",Article,Scopus

Despite the many comparative studies on organisms living in urban and non-urban areas, our knowledge on species responses to urban environments remains limited. For one, much of the ecological research has assumed that the environment changes in a linear fashion from the city core to the city edges, whereas in reality the environments within the cities are highly heterogeneous. Furthermore, studies on species responses to these highly variable ecosystems are often based on interspecific mean trait values, which ignore the potential for high levels of intraspecific variation among individuals in key functional traits. The current study investigated intraspecific functional trait differences for four functional traits associated with body size, mobility and resource selection among rural and urban populations of two common bumblebee species, Bombus pascuorum and Bombus lapidarius, in urban centres and adjacent rural areas in Switzerland. We document shifts in functional traits towards smaller individuals and higher multidimensional trait variation in urban populations compared to rural conspecifics of both species. This shows that urban individuals for both species are on average smaller sized but populations are distinctively different from rural population by increasing their trait richness and diversifying their trait combinations. In addition, we found bimodality in tongue length within urban B. pascuorum populations. Our results suggest that urban and rural populations possibly experience differential selection pressures resulting in trait differences across and among populations. We argue that variations in the respective foraging landscapes in cities leads to smaller sized but phenotypically more diverse populations, and drive functional trait divergence. © 2019 The Authors.

Each forager bee displays a tendency of loyalty toward specific plant species during the many daily foraging flights. Due to the ease of collection, pollen loads have been extensively used as a proxy for detection of pesticide residues. Pollen is the main protein food source for colonies, and its contamination has also been addressed as a reason for the colony losses phenomenon. As honeybees fly over a variable but wide range territory, they might collect pollen from both agricultural, urban and wild environments, also displaying considerable preferences in botanical sources between colonies of the same apiary. It is thus difficult to address the source of the pesticide contamination, when pollen is analyzed as a whole. In the current study, a practical and reliable approach has been proposed to narrow down the source of contamination. Pollen loads have been collected from colonies placed in eight locations over large apple orchard extensions in Trentino-South Tyrol region (Italy), during and 2 weeks after apple blossom. The pollen loads have been separated by the color due to the predominant plant species. On each color group, palynology and multi-residual chemical analyses have been performed in parallel. The pollen hazard quotient (PHQ) was used to estimate the risk to honeybees of each color group and of the total collected pollen. Apple and dandelion pollen were the main portions of the first collection, while a greater variety emerged after the apple blossom. Dandelion was always present in the samples. The frequency and the amount of pesticide residues differed according to the collection periods, the locations and the pollen color groups. The amount of insecticide residues increased after the apple blossom, while no difference between the period was found on fungicide residues. The PHQ values were higher after the blossom due to the insecticide contribution, with highest values of 160,000 and 150,000. The variations within samples did not allow to identify a unique source of contamination, whereas it seems that the pollen from plants outside the agricultural areas has as much residues as the pollen from apple orchards. © Copyright © 2019 Favaro, Bauer, Rossi, D’Ambrosio, Bucher and Angeli.",Article,Scopus

The aim of this study was to examine pollen flow dynamics in a population of the Xylocopa bee-pollinated Passiflora caerulea using fluorescent powdered dyes as pollen mimics and to analyze the relationship between inter-plant distance and fruit production. Plant arrangement, number of flowers per plant, pollen flow and fruit set exhibited leptokurtic distributions as a function of the distance between plants. Minimum and maximum dispersal distances were 4 m and 257 m, respectively. Geitonogamous transfers were more frequent than xenogamous ones. Pollinator movements, evidenced by pollen analogues transferences, responded to plant arrangement. Centris sp. was recorded for the first time as a pollinator of Passiflora caerulea. Fruit set decayed as distance between individuals increased. The tools employed allowed to better understand the dependence between plant population structure, pollinator movement, pollen flow and fruit production, as well as to generate recommendations for crop spatial design of this promising and self-incompatible species, which will counteract the effects of harvesting from the wild. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Article,Scopus

Cluster analysis was performed to assess similarity in botanical composition between pot-pollen and pot-honey provisions from different colonies. The results indicated that each colony was capable to access to different plant species for obtaining nectar and pollen, a fact observed when discarding the contaminated honey samples. As honey samples were not clustered together with other ones but with pollen samples indicating a similar botanical composition, it could be assumed that a same plant species provided nectar and pollen to bees. Resource partitioning was not clearly observed among a subset of late spring colonies, as two families of high richness of species and abundant in this dry forest (the mimosoid clade in Fabaceae and Capparaceae) were foraged. A higher number of synchronously sampled colonies would be necessary to detect this ecological aspect.

These challenges can give rise to recognition mechanisms that adaptively integrate information across multiple sensory modalities. The valley carpenter bee, Xylocopa varipuncta, nests in dead wood in large aggregations of up to several dozen nests. This study investigates the proximate mechanisms by which returning foragers quickly and reliably identify their own nest entrance within a high-density nesting site. We manipulated long- and short-range visual cues associated with nest entrances, removed chemical cues on the inside of nest entrances and added chemical cues from foreign conspecific bees. By measuring the effect of these manipulations on nest search time and search accuracy, we assessed the importance of visual and olfactory sensory modalities in allowing carpenter bees to locate their nests within aggregations. Our results support the hypothesis that both visual and olfactory cues can facilitate nest localization. Removal of nest olfactory cues did not significantly disrupt homing, suggesting that olfactory information may not be necessary for nest localization when visual information is available. However, the addition of olfactory cues from unfamiliar conspecific bees actually aided nest localization rather than disrupting it, suggesting that bees may use generalized species odour cues for homing. Due to intense nest site competition within aggregations, nest localization may have important social implications for maintenance of high-density nesting. © 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour",Article,Scopus

To reverse these effects, flowering habitat enhancements are designed to provide supplemental nutritional resources for wild bees and are particularly important when few resources are available in the surrounding landscape. Yet, it is not known whether or how habitat enhancements support bee populations under varying landscape contexts. Body size is a morphological trait that is strongly linked to foraging ability, immune function, and fitness in bees. Landscape simplification has been associated with size declines across bee taxa and smaller body size can be an early indicator of environmental stress. To determine whether the negative effects of landscape simplification on body size can be improved by adding floral resources to farm landscapes, we measured the body size of 10 wild bee species collected at 70 sites with or without habitat enhancements in Michigan and New York. Bees were collected at sites with varying amounts of agriculture in the surrounding landscape, allowing us to test whether morphological responses to enhancements are affected by landscape simplification. Half of the bee species measured exhibited declining body size across the landscape gradient. Among these species, declines were buffered by the presence of habitat enhancements suggesting this response is the result of improved nutrition, reduced need for long-distance foraging, enhanced recruitment of larger individuals or a combination of these mechanisms. Declines in body size were strongest in both the smallest and the largest species. Large and medium sized species exhibited the greatest response to flowering habitat enhancements. Synthesis and applications. At sites with high agricultural cover, we observed intraspecific body size declines among many species; however, we did not observe decreased body size in any species at sites with a flowering habitat enhancement. Therefore, our findings suggest that the presence of flowering habitat enhancements can support wild bees experiencing stress from intensively managed agricultural landscapes across multiple cropping systems and regions. © 2019 The Authors.

Yet when plants and pollinators co-evolve, it is not clear if this will also result in frequent cospeciation. Here, we investigate the mutual evolutionary history of South African oil-collecting Rediviva bees and their Diascia host plants, in which the elongated forelegs of female Rediviva have been suggested to coevolve with the oil-producing spurs of their Diascia hosts. After controlling for phylogenetic nonindependence, we found Rediviva foreleg length to be significantly correlated with Diascia spur length, suggestive of co-evolution. However, as trait correlation could also be due to pollinator shifts, we tested if cospeciation or pollinator shifts have dominated the evolution of Rediviva–Diascia interactions by analysing phylogenies in a cophylogenetic framework. Distance-based cophylogenetic analyses (PARAFIT, PACo) indicated significant congruence of the two phylogenies under most conditions. Yet, we found that phylogenetic relatedness was correlated with ecological similarity (the spectrum of partners that each taxon interacted with) only for Diascia but not for Rediviva, suggesting that phylogenetic congruence might be due to phylogenetic tracking by Diascia of Rediviva rather than strict (reciprocal) co-evolution. Furthermore, event-based reconciliation using a parsimony approach (CORE-PA) on average revealed only 11–13 cospeciation events but 58–80 pollinator shifts. Probabilistic cophylogenetic analyses (COALA) supported this trend (8–29 cospeciations vs. 40 pollinator shifts). Our study suggests that diversification of Diascia has been largely driven by Rediviva (phylogenetic tracking, pollinator shifts) but not vice versa. Moreover, our data suggest that, even in co-evolving mutualisms, cospeciation events might occur only infrequently. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus

However, there is disagreement regarding how a conspecific cue is perceived by other foragers (enhancement or inhibition). Most studies manipulate the total number of bees foraging in an arena or the presence or absence of a bee on a flower and then observe the behavior of one forager in response to a single conspecific, which does not reflect natural foraging. We tested how a range of conspecifics on flowers affected on which flowers foraging honey bees landed. We trained students from a biology class for non-STEM majors to collect data and tested whether the number of conspecifics on flowers influences on which flower foragers land. We found that foragers land more frequently on flowers occupied by more conspecifics, which supports the hypothesis that conspecifics are cues for local enhancement.

The assessment of the diet of the stingless bee Melipona orbignyi was carried out by comparing different calculations from palynological data being the index of relative importance (IRI) the most complete, objective, and here recommended. This index showed that the order of the four most important pollen resources was Prosopis (IRI = 3354), Albizia inundata (1999), Cynophalla retusa (921), and Solanum type 2 (693), and the value of importance of species (SI) calculated for honey resources showed that they were type Maytenus (SI = 20.79), Prosopis (18.73), Cynophalla retusa (6.72), and Ziziphus mistol (3.32). Three flower types predominated in pollen and nectar provisions: brush flowers, solanoid flowers with poricidal anthers, and generalized small pale flowers, being the former two associated to buzzing. The abundance of the nectarless Solanum in honey samples is discussed. Good forest management practices for pollinator conservation native to the Chaco forest should include the keeping of undisturbed forest patches for nesting and foraging while the surrounding forest resources are managed in a sustainable way. Furthermore, because some threatened plants important for the M. orbignyi diet require gene flow to maintain healthy populations, short distances among the forest patches are needed, a fact that also helps to avoid genetic drift in Melipona colonies. The rational rearing of Melipona orbignyi would be a good practice to be implemented to promote pollination of threatened tree and shrub individuals isolated by forest fragmentation. © 2019, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Scopus

Given these abilities, if a worker is displaced, will it switch to a new forage resource close by or will it navigate back to the original forage patch? To address this question we collected 210 Bombus vosnesenskii workers from an ornamental Spirea patch, marked them with numbered tags, transported them in a cooler, and released them at seven distances, from 1.5 km to 16 km, in each of two directions. Each worker that returned to the Spirea patch was recaptured, and re-released at its first release location. Over 8 observation days, 54 workers from 11 release locations returned to the Spirea patch. Of these, 16 were recaptured twice, 13 three times, 5 four times and 1 five times. Nine workers returned from release distances ≥10 km, including one from 16 km, despite the presence of multiple rewarding resources between the release location and the Spirea patch. Returns were rapid—three workers released up to 5 km away were recaptured within 4 h, while a worker from 13 km returned within 30 h of release. Wind direction, wind speed, and release direction had significant (P < 0.05) impacts on release-to-recapture-times. Also, workers returned significantly (P < 0.001) more quickly during subsequent trips compared to their first return.

However, empirical evidence to support this prediction is scarce. We investigated the influences of semi-natural habitats and nesting resources on concentration effect and waylaying effect of bees, as well as their consequences on crop pollination in landscapes. Ninety-seven vetch patches with independent gradients of size and distances to nesting sites were selected from 11 agricultural landscapes with independent gradients of surrounding semi-natural habitats and nesting resources. Semi-natural habitats and nesting resources were quantified either by field inspections or from satellite images; flower visitor densities and vetch pollination services were measured across overall flowering seasons. The proportion of semi-natural habitats did not modify the concentration effect or waylaying effect of the abundant and highly social honey bees or the solitary species Anthophora waltoni. The increase in area of brick walls, acting as nesting resources of A. waltoni, increased the concentration effect and the waylaying effect. For other solitary bees, the proportion of semi-natural habitats and the proportion of buildings did not influence the concentration effect or the waylaying effect. Honey bee density, A. waltoni density and other solitary bee density positively predict vetch pollination services. The landscape-modified concentration effect and waylaying effect cascaded to vetch pollination by modifying A. waltoni density. Our findings indicated that landscape composition could modify the spatial foraging patterns of bees and influence pollination services provided to crops, but those varied among different taxonomic groups. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

Here we present and test a set of simple control rules underlying the execution of learning flights that closely mimic those performed by ground-nesting wasps. In the simplest model, we assume that the angle between flight direction and the nest direction as seen from the position of the insect is constant and only flips sign when pivoting direction around the nest is changed, resulting in a concatenation of piecewise defined logarithmic spirals. We then added characteristic properties of real learning flights, such as head saccades and the condition that the nest entrance within the visual field is kept nearly constant to describe the development of a learning flight in a head-centered frame of reference, assuming that the retinal position of the nest is known. We finally implemented a closed-loop simulation of learning flights based on a small set of visual control rules. The visual input for this model are rendered views generated from 3D reconstructions of natural wasp nesting sites, and the retinal nest position is controlled by means of simple template-based tracking. We show that naturalistic paths can be generated without knowledge of the absolute distance to the nest or of the flight speed. We demonstrate in addition that nest-tagged views recorded during such simulated learning flights are sufficient for a homing agent to pinpoint the goal, by identifying nest direction when encountering familiar views. We discuss how the information acquired during learning flights close to the nest can be integrated with long-range homing models. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Scopus

One expanding area of honey bee research is analysis of their microbial community including viruses. Several RNA viruses have been characterized but little is known about DNA viruses associated with bees. Here, using a metagenomics based approach, we reveal the presence of a broad range of novel single-stranded DNA viruses from the hemolymph and brain of nurse and forager (worker divisions of labour) bees belonging to two honey bees subspecies, Italian (Apis mellifera linguistica) and New World Carniolan (Apis mellifera carnica). Genomes of 100 diverse viruses were identified, designated into three groupings; genomoviruses (family Genomoviridae) (n = 4), unclassified replication associated protein encoding single-stranded DNA viruses (n = 28), and microviruses (family Microviridae; subfamily Gokushovirinae) (n = 70). Amongst the viruses identified, it appears that nurses harbour a higher diversity of these viruses comparative to the foragers. Between subspecies, the most striking outcome was the extremely high number of diverse microviruses identified in the Italian bees comparative to the New World Carniolan, likely indicating an association to the diversity of the bacterial community associated with these subspecies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

Landscape genomics offers powerful tools to assess the influence of landscape modifications on genetic diversity and functional connectivity, and to identify adaptations to local environmental conditions that could facilitate future bee survival. Here, we assessed range-wide patterns of genetic structure, genetic diversity, gene flow, and local adaptation in the stingless bee Melipona subnitida, a tropical pollinator of key biological and economic importance inhabiting one of the driest and hottest regions of South America. Our results reveal four genetic clusters across the species’ full distribution range. All populations were found to be under a mutation–drift equilibrium, and genetic diversity was not influenced by the amount of reminiscent natural habitats. However, genetic relatedness was spatially autocorrelated and isolation by landscape resistance explained range-wide relatedness patterns better than isolation by geographic distance, contradicting earlier findings for stingless bees. Specifically, gene flow was enhanced by increased thermal stability, higher forest cover, lower elevations, and less corrugated terrains. Finally, we detected genomic signatures of adaptation to temperature, precipitation, and forest cover, spatially distributed in latitudinal and altitudinal patterns. Taken together, our findings shed important light on the life history of M. subnitida and highlight the role of regions with large thermal fluctuations, deforested areas, and mountain ranges as dispersal barriers. Conservation actions such as restricting long-distance colony transportation, preserving local adaptations, and improving the connectivity between highlands and lowlands are likely to assure future pollination services. © 2019 The Authors.

However, the basic ABC only evolves one colony and both the employed bee phase and onlooker phase utilize the same solution search equation, which performs well in exploration but poorly in exploitation. Inspired by the good working efficiency of labor division and the coordination of complementary elements, we propose a novel individual dependent multi-colony ABC algorithm, abbreviated as IDABC, in which the whole colony is divided into three sub-colonies, i.e., inferior sub-colony, mid sub-colony and superior sub-colony, based on the fitness function values of the individuals involved. Three evolution operators with different searching biases are introduced into the corresponding sub-colonies in order to play different roles. Furthermore, we improve the related evolution operators by incorporating the fitness and distance information of individuals and the control parameters involved in the food source perturbation that are dynamically adjusted according to the search experience. And an orthogonal learning mechanism is suggested for scout bee searching so as to generate potential solutions. The proposed IDABC is examined in a set of benchmark instances taken from the CEC2013 and CEC2014 competition, and comparative results demonstrate the competitive performance of IDABC. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus

Unlike honeybees and bumblebees that have been popular subjects of extensive studies on their neuroethology, behaviour and ecology, carpenter bees have received little attention. This review integrates what is known about their foraging behaviour as well as sensory, physiological and cognitive adaptations and is motivated by their versatility as flower visitors and pollinators. This is evident from their extremely generalist foraging and adeptness at handling diverse flower types as legitimate pollinators and as illegitimate nectar robbers. They purportedly use traplining to forage between isolated patches and are long-distance flyers over several kilometres suggesting well-developed spatial learning, route memory and navigational capabilities. They have a broad range of temperature tolerance and thermoregulatory capabilities which are likely employed in their forays into crepuscular and nocturnal time periods. Such temporal extensions into dim-light periods invoke a suite of visual adaptations in their apposition optics.

A recent model utilises allometric coefficients for five of the seven extant bee families (Apoidea: Anthophila) to include crucial but difficult-to-measure traits, such as proboscis length, in ecological and evolutionary studies. Melittidae were not included although they are important pollinators in South Africa where they comprise an especially rich and morphologically diverse fauna. We measured intertegular distance (correlated with body size) and proboscis length of 179 specimens of 11 species from three genera of Melittidae. With the inclusion of Melittidae, we tested the between family differences in the allometric scaling coefficients. AIC model selection was used to establish which factors provide the best estimate of proboscis length. We explored a hypothesis that has been proposed in the literature, but which has not been tested, whereby body and range sizes of bees are correlated with rainfall regions. We tested this by using body size measurements of 2109 museum specimens from 56 species of Melittidae and applied the model coefficients to estimate proboscis length and foraging distance. Our results from testing differences across bee families show that with the addition of Melittidae, we retained the overall pattern of significant differences in the scaling coefficient among Apoidea, with our model explaining 98% of the variance in species-level means for proboscis length. When testing the relationship between body size and rainfall region we found no relationship for South African Melittidae. Overall, this study has added allometric scaling coefficients for an important bee family and shown the applicability of using these coefficients when linked with museum specimens to test ecological hypothesis. © 2019 Melin et al.",Article,Scopus

One explanation as to why some species have declined, based primarily on studies of the European bumble bee fauna, is that declining species have relatively narrow pollen-foraging niches and are less able to use alternative host plants in the absence of their preferred hosts. Though extensively explored in Europe, this hypothesis has not been investigated in North America, in part due to incomplete information on the foraging niche of many species. We selected 12 bumble bee species found in Michigan and quantified their pollen diets using museum specimens. We also extensively resurveyed the state to understand their contemporary status and distribution. Compared to a pre-2000 baseline, six species remain relatively common and widespread, whereas six species show range contractions of over 50%. There was a significant relationship between dietary breadth and distributional range change, with declined or declining species collecting around one-third fewer pollen types than stable species. Though there were significant compositional differences, we found no differences in the number of pollen types collected by species with differing tongue lengths. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that species with narrower dietary niches are at greater risk of decline. However, it is not clear if narrow dietary niches are a cause of declines, or if both are driven by an underlying factor such as proximity to the edge of climatic niches. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of dietary niche in bumble bees, and how it interacts with other factors to influence population trajectories of stable and at-risk species. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America",Article,Scopus

Geographic mosaic theory of coevolution (GMC) proposes that the dynamics of coevolution between pairs or group of species often occur at different geographic scales. There are three hypotheses on the coevolutionary process. (1) Different evolutionary interaction trajectories among populations are likely to generate a selection mosaic. (2) A mixture of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots. Hot spots are the subset of communities in which much of the coevolutionary change occurs and coldspots refer to areas where coevolutionary selection hardly occurs or completely does not occur. (3) There is a continual population remixing of the range of coevolving traits, resulting from the selection mosaic, coevolutionary hotspots, gene flow, random genetic drift, and local extinction of subpopulations. Studies of GMC between plants and pollinators indicate that shifts of effective pollinators among different geographic populations may cause divergence in floral traits (i.e., pollination ecotype). Changes of pollinator assemblages or species components have been illustrated coevolving with floral morphology or reward among populations from different altitudes or habitats. Here, recent case studies of GMC between plants and pollinators are grouped into five categories: Floral morphology and pollinator components, corolla tube/nectar spur and pollinator feeding structure, floral color, floral scents, floral rewards and pollinator assemblages. Floral tube or nectar spur length is positively related to pollinator body structures, such as the proboscis and leg length. The adaptation of flower color and pollinator vision provides a series of examples for the GMC. With the increase of altitude, flower color changed from blue and ultraviolet blue adapted to bee vision to blue-green and green adapted to fly vision. Recent study indicated that the difference in cycad odor components related to a shift of beetle species in different regions, suggesting a potential coevolutionary relationship between flower odor and pollinators. Studies showed that where bees foraged more nectar, flowers secreted more nectar, suggesting that floral reward amounts and types coevolve with pollinators among different geographic populations. An examination of GMC in plant-pollinator interactions involves three steps in general: (1) Detection of the relationship between floral traits and pollinator shift or body structure. (2) Transplanting experiments to detect differences in seed set between native phenotypes and transplanted phenotypes. (3) Single pollinator visit experiment to detect pollen output differences between native and transplanted phenotypes. Experimental evolutionary biology not only can test whether floral variation is related to pollinator shifts, but also make people aware of the impact of the reduction or loss of pollinators on the evolutionary consequences. To illustrate GMC between plants and pollinators, it is essential to isolate the evolutionary changes in traits caused by biotic factors or abiotic factors in future. It would be highly appreciated if genome scans and analysis are used in further studies to explore the genome-wide patterns of GMC between plants and pollinators. © 2019, Science Press.

It has been shown that bees establish a specific site for their waggle dances that is likely marked with chemical signals. By recording the site where dances take place on the comb in a single-frame observation hive, we investigated the relative importance of three different criteria for the selection of the dance floor by bees, including the distance from the hive entrance, the cell filling, and the chemical marking by bees and found that all these criteria play a role, albeit their importance does not seem to be equal. Significance statement: The existence of a dance floor, where forager bees perform most waggle dances after returning to the hive, was first reported by von Frisch and later confirmed by various authors; however, the factors affecting the choice of a certain site, for this purpose, by bees have not received so far sufficient attention. Besides confirming the existence of a specific site on the comb where bees prefer to dance, we clarified the criteria used by bees for establishing this site, showing that both the distance from the entrance, the quality of the comb, and the chemical marking by bees play a role. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Scopus

Resultant fragmentation and loss of suitable foraging habitats, combined with pesticide exposure, may increase demands on foraging, specifically the ability to collect or reach sufficient resources under such stress. Understanding effects that pesticides have on flight performance is therefore vital if we are to assess colony success in these changing landscapes. Neonicotinoids are one of the most widely used classes of pesticide across the globe, and exposure to bees has been associated with reduced foraging efficiency and homing ability. One explanation for these effects could be that elements of flight are being affected, but apart from a couple of studies on the honeybee (Apis mellifera), this has scarcely been tested. Here, we used flight mills to investigate how exposure to a field realistic (10 ppb) acute dose of imidacloprid affected flight performance of a wild insect pollinator—the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris audax. Intriguingly, observations showed exposed workers flew at a significantly higher velocity over the first ¾ km of flight. This apparent hyperactivity, however, may have a cost because exposed workers showed reduced flight distance and duration to around a third of what control workers were capable of achieving. Given that bumblebees are central place foragers, impairment to flight endurance could translate to a decline in potential forage area, decreasing the abundance, diversity, and nutritional quality of available food, while potentially diminishing pollination service capabilities. © 2019 The Authors.

However, relying on biotic pollen dispersers also exposes plants to challenges, which include, for instance, the need to match the ecologies and phenologies of the pollinator species. Because of their ecological simplicity, specialized pollination systems are useful models to understand some of the variables that modulate how zoophilous pollination evolves, and whether or not species involved in pollination interactions respond jointly to evolutionary or ecological processes. In this study, we used a combination of field work, species distribution modeling (SDM), and geospatial analyses to investigate whether the number of floral visits by different pollinators in specialized zoophilous pollination interactions is correlated with the climatic suitability of the pollinator insects and, thus, to insect potential abundance. To do this, we investigated the pollination biology of four Calceolaria L. (Calceolariacea) species from central Chile, and we sampled across their whole ranges. Our results indicate that the four plant species are pollinated by different oil-bees of genera Centris Fabricius (Apidae: Centridini) and Chalepogenus Holmberg (Apidae: Tapinotaspidini), and that the number of floral visits varies at different localities. Our SDMs were accurate, successfully recovering the known ranges of the pollinators. Our analyses indicated that most plant species occur at localities in which insect climatic suitabilities are high. Furthermore, the number of pollinator visits at each locality was significantly and positively correlated with the insect suitability values, suggesting that matching high suitability areas can indeed increase the reproductive success of the plants. © The Author(s) 2018.

In northern-hemisphere systems, mass flowering plants can act as ‘pollinator magnets’. Magnets can reduce the pollination success of adjacent co-flowering neighbours by drawing pollinators from these plants. However, magnets can also produce pollination ‘spillover-effects’ through increased pollinator movements to adjacent co-flowering taxa, potentially either increasing pollination or impacting it through transfer of mixed-species pollen. The impact of agricultural species on co-flowering plants in Australia is unknown. Native Australian plants evolved with unique pollinators and yet agricultural pollination is dominated by the exotic honeybee Apis mellifera. We tested how distance (to 250 m) from each of two populations of Lavender (Lavandula spp.) (2 years), Nectarines (Prunus persica var. nucipersica or var. nectarina) (1 year) and the pasture weed Paterson's Curse (Echium plantagineum) (2 years) affected pollinator diversity and abundance within experimental arrays of native and northern-hemisphere plants. For Paterson's Curse, we tested whether visitation varied when honeybee abundance was experimentally increased. As expected, we found magnets attracted significantly more honeybee visits in all possible comparisons across combinations of species, sites and years. However, contrary to expectation, in 10 of 18 comparisons, co-flowering species supported a slightly higher diversity of pollinators than magnets, with honeybees comprising a significantly lower proportion of flower visitors in 14 comparisons. The exceptions, which included populations of all three magnet species, were cases where honeybees were the only visitor (6 comparisons) or the magnet and co-flowering species were each visited by a single but different pollinator (2 compariosns). Most strikingly, our data provided no evidence of pollinator spillover. More than 95% of all pollinators on co-flowering species carried only their pollen and overall pollinator abundance didn't vary significantly with distance from magnets at any site or time. Honeybee abundance did not vary significantly with distance from magnets. For Paterson's Curse, the addition of managed hives increased honeybee abundance on co-flowering species in two of eight cases, but pollinator abundance didn't vary with distance from the magnet. Overall, we found few direct effects of mass flowering agricultural species on the pollination of either Australian native or exotic neighbours. The lack of spillover-effects may largely reflect the unusually high species fidelity of foraging A. mellifera. However, the numerical dominance of honeybees within Australian agricultural systems may impact pollination at the regional level. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

But despite concerns, there have been no empirical studies investigating the impact of A. manicatum on North American pollinators. Therefore, across a two-year study, we monitored foraging behavior and fitness of the common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) in response to A. manicatum presence. We found that B. impatiens avoided foraging near A. manicatum in both years; but despite this resource exclusion, we found no evidence of fitness consequences for B. impatiens.

(Hymenoptera: Apidae) foragers, to evaluate the exposure of honey bees to pesticides through pollen and as a biomonitoring tool. Typically, these surveys have found frequent contamination of pollen with multiple pesticides, with most of the estimated risk of acute oral toxicity to honey bees coming from insecticides. In our survey of pesticides in trapped pollen from three commercial ornamental plant nurseries in Connecticut, we found most samples within the range of acute toxicity in a previous state pollen survey, but a few samples at one nursery with unusually high acute oral toxicity. Using visual sorting by color of the pollen pellets collected in two samples from this nursery, followed by pesticide analysis of the sorted pollen and palynology to identify the plant sources of the pollen with the greatest acute toxicity of pesticide residues, we were able to associate pollen from the plant genus Spiraea L. (Rosales: Rosaceae) with extraordinarily high concentrations of thiamethoxam and clothianidin, and also with high concentrations of acephate and its metabolite methamidophos. This study is the first to trace highly toxic pollen collected by honey bees to a single plant genus.

One past approach has been to reduce noise. Lately, with the advance of quantitative tools, an alternative is to use the noise to improve model predictions. Here we take the latter approach to improve our ability to recover honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) foraging locations, in particular the distance at which they forage, from observed waggle dance communications, which encode the vector from the hive to the forage. This vector gives both the distance from the hive to the forage, which is encoded in dance duration, and the direction from the hive to the forage, which is encoded in the angle that the bee makes while dancing. We analysed the waggle dances from individually marked honey bees (N = 859 dances from 85 bees from 3 hives) that foraged at multiple known locations to determine a distance-to-duration calibration. Next we compared this calibration to a previously published calibration, which demonstrated that while their slopes were similar (P = 0.82), their intercepts differed (P < 0.001); however, the individual variation, or noise, between bees was so high that this difference was rendered biologically irrelevant. We then collated our data with all published calibration studies to generate a universal calibration that incorporates the interindividual and interstudy differences. Lastly, we verified that the universal calibration performed as well as a landscape/subspecies-specific calibration, first with a hold-out sample of waggle dances (N = 84) (performance comparison: P = 0.36) and second with a linear discriminant analysis, which failed to assign dances to their originating population. Both results confirm that the universal calibration may be used, irrespective of landscape or subspecies. Therefore, by allowing noise to be part of our analysis, the usability of our calibration is broadened for use in future settings. © 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour",Article,Scopus

To extend understanding of how shifts in area, biomes, and pollinators impact diversification in plants, we examined the relationships of these shifts to diversification across the mega-genus Salvia. Methods: A chronogram was developed from a supermatrix of anchored hybrid enrichment genomic data and targeted sequence data for over 500 of the nearly 1000 Salvia species. Ancestral areas and biomes were reconstructed using BioGeoBEARS. Pollinator guilds were scored, ancestral pollinators determined, shifts in pollinator guilds identified, and rates of pollinator switches compared. Key Results: A well-resolved phylogenetic backbone of Salvia and updated subgeneric designations are presented. Salvia originated in Southwest Asia in the Oligocene and subsequently dispersed worldwide. Biome shifts are frequent from a likely ancestral lineage utilizing broadleaf and/or coniferous forests and/or arid shrublands. None of the four species diversification shifts are correlated to shifts in biomes. Shifts in pollination system are not correlated to species diversification shifts, except for one hummingbird shift that precedes a major shift in diversification near the crown of New World subgen. Calosphace. Multiple reversals back to bee pollination occurred within this hummingbird clade. Conclusions: Salvia diversified extensively in different continents, biomes, and with both bee and bird pollinators. The lack of tight correlation of area, biome, and most pollinator shifts to the four documented species diversification shifts points to other important drivers of speciation in Salvia. © 2019 Botanical Society of America",Article,Scopus

Pollinators provide a foundation for ecological communities by assisting in the reproduction of native plants, yet our understanding of how pollinators such as wild bees respond to variation in fire severity is limited, particularly for forest ecosystems. Here, we took advantage of a natural experiment created by a large-scale, mixed-severity wildfire to provide the first assessment of how wild bee communities are shaped by fire severity in mixed-conifer forest. We sampled bees in the Douglas Fire Complex, a 19,000-ha fire in southern Oregon, USA, to evaluate how bee communities responded to local-scale fire severity. We found that fire severity served a strong driver of bee diversity: 20 times more individuals and 11 times more species were captured in areas that experienced high fire severity relative to areas with the lowest fire severity. In addition, we found pronounced seasonality in the local bee community, with more individuals and more species captured during late summer, especially in severely burned regions of the landscape. Two critical habitat components for maintaining bee populations—flowering plants and boring insect exit holes used by cavity-nesting bees—also increased with fire severity. Although we detected shifts in the relative abundance of several bee and plant genera along the fire severity gradient, the two most abundant bee genera (Bombus and Halictus) responded positively to high fire severity despite differences in their typical foraging ranges. Our study demonstrates that within a large wildfire mosaic, severely burned forest contained the most diverse wild bee communities. This finding has particularly important implications for biodiversity in fire-prone areas given the expected expansion of wildfires in the coming decades. © 2019 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

In the Prairie Pothole Region, wetland remnants are a common feature in intensively cultivated landscapes. These wetlands are typically small and often left embedded in the cropland matrix and may act as the only semi-natural feature in a radius of several hundred metres. To quantify the role that these in-field wetlands play in supporting native pollinators, we sampled bees at three distances from the wetland margin into the surrounding cropland (0 m, 25 m and 75 m) across the season in three field types (canola, cereal and perennial grassland). We used Bayesian multilevel models to test the hypothesis that native bees are using infield wetlands as habitat for nesting and foraging. Native bee abundance and diversity decreased further away from the margin of wetlands in both canola and cereal fields, while it increased in wetlands located in perennial grassland. Community composition did not change further away from wetlands, which may be because the foraging range of most species was within the sampling distance of the study. These results suggest that wetlands play an important role in providing critical resources for native pollinators, and encouraging farmers not to drain or plow through these wetlands will have beneficial impacts for native pollinators in the area. Maintaining in-field wetlands may have additional pollination benefits for farmers growing crops such as canola, which is known to benefit from insect visitors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

To document how toads use this resource, we spool-tracked cane toads in areas containing beehives and in adjacent natural habitat without beehives, conducted standardized observations of toad feeding behaviour, and ran prey-manipulation trials to compare the responses of cane toads versus native frogs to honeybees as potential prey. Toads feeding around beehives travelled shorter distances per night, and hence used different microhabitats, than did toads from nearby control sites without beehives. The toads consumed live bees from the hive entrance (rather than dead bees from the ground), often climbing on top of one another to gain access to the hive entrance. Prey manipulation trials confirm that bee movement is the critical stimulus that elicits the toads’ feeding response; and in standardized trials, native frogs consumed bees less frequently than did toads.

Brood parasites enter the nests of other species and divert host resources for producing their own offspring, which can lead to strong antagonistic parasite–host coevolution. Here, we look at commonalities among social insect species that are victims of brood parasites, and use phylogenetic data and information on geographical range size to predict which species are most probably to fall victims to brood parasites in the future. In our analyses, we focus on three eusocial hymenopteran groups and their brood parasites: (i) bumblebees, (ii) Myrmica ants, and (iii) vespine and polistine wasps. In these groups, some, but not all, species are parasitized by obligate workerless inquilines that only produce reproductive-caste descendants. We find phylogenetic signals for geographical range size and the presence of parasites in bumblebees, but not in ants and wasps. Phylogenetic logistic regressions indicate that the probability of being attacked by one or more brood parasite species increases with the size of the geographical range in bumblebees, but the effect is statistically only marginally significant in ants. However, non-phylogenetic logistic regressions suggest that bumblebee species with the largest geographical range sizes may have a lower likelihood of harbouring social parasites than do hosts with medium-sized ranges. Our results provide new insights into the ecology and evolution of host–social parasite systems, and indicate that host phylogeny and geographical range size can be used to predict threats posed by social parasites, as well to design efficient conservation measures for both hosts and their parasites.

Insects are among the organisms with the largest diversity in urbanized environments. Here, we sampled predator (Ampulicidae, Sphecidae and Crabronidae) and parasitoid (Tachinidae) flower-visiting insects in 36 sites in the city of Rome (Italy). Although the diversity of herbivorous insects in urban areas mostly depends on the availability of flowering plants and nesting sites, predators and parasitoids generally require a larger number of resources during their life cycle, and are expected to be particularly influenced by urbanization. As flower-visitors can easily move between habitat patches, the effect of urbanization was tested at multiple spatial scales (local, landscape and sub-regional). We found that urbanization influenced predator and parasitoid flower-visitors at all three spatial scales. At the local scale, streets and buildings negatively influenced evenness of predators and species richness and abundance of parasitoids probably acting as dispersal barrier. At the landscape scale, higher percentage of urban decreased predator abundance, while increasing their evenness, suggesting an increase in generalist and highly mobile species. Area and compactness (i.e. Contiguity index) of urban green interactively influenced predator communities, whereas evenness of parasitoids increased with increasing Contiguity index. At the sub-regional scale, species richness and abundance of predators increased with increasing distance from the city center. Compared to previous studies testing the effect of urbanization, we found little variation in species richness, abundance and evenness along our urbanization gradient. The current insect fauna has been probably selected for its tolerance to habitat loss and fragmentation, being the result of the intensive anthropogenic alteration occurred in the area in the last centuries. Conservation strategies aimed at predator and parasitoid flying insects have to take in account variables at multiple spatial-scales, as well as the complementarity of resources across the landscape. © 2019 Corcos et al.

In Wisconsin, harvesting increased forb richness, cover, and evenness compared to unharvested control sites. Harvesting negatively affected aboveground-nesting bee richness and emergence from trap nests, possibly because of nest destruction during the previous harvest. By contrast, harvesting positively affected belowground-nesting bee richness, possibly because of the greater food resource availability and reduced thatch allowing greater access to nesting sites in the soil. Harvesting also affected bee community composition, reflecting the increase in belowground-nesting species at harvested sites. Despite harvesting effects on forb and bee communities, there was no effect on flower visitation rate, indicating little effect on pollination function. We did not find a harvest by landscape context interaction, which, in combination with the negative harvesting effect on trap nest emergence, suggests that harvesting can affect local population growth rather than simply affecting forager aggregation in different resource environments. For bees, there was no harvest by study year interaction, indicating a consistent response over a short timescale. Similarly, in Michigan, belowground-nesting species also responded positively to harvesting, which was more pronounced in sandier soils that are preferred for nesting. However, other components of the Michigan bee and forb communities were not significantly affected by biomass harvesting. Overall, our study demonstrates that harvesting grasslands can positively affect the ~80% of bee species that nest belowground by enhancing nest and/or forage resources, but that conserving aboveground nesters may require leaving some area unharvested. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America",Article,Scopus

This cuticular maturation heterochrony may be associated with life style, considering that eusocial bees remain protected inside the nest for many days after emergence, while the solitary bees immediately start outside activities. To address this issue, we characterized gene expression using large-scale RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and quantified cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in comparative studies of the integument (cuticle plus its underlying epidermis) of two eusocial and a solitary bee species. In addition, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for studying the developing cuticle of these and other three bee species also differing in life style. We found 13,200, 55,209 and 30,161 transcript types in the integument of the eusocial Apis mellifera and Frieseomelitta varia, and the solitary Centris analis, respectively. In general, structural cuticle proteins and chitin-related genes were upregulated in pharate-adults and newly-emerged bees whereas transcripts for odorant binding proteins, cytochrome P450 and antioxidant proteins were overrepresented in foragers. Consistent with our hypothesis, a distance correlation analysis based on the differentially expressed genes suggested delayed cuticle maturation in A. mellifera in comparison to the solitary bee. However, this was not confirmed in the comparison with F. varia. The expression profiles of 27 of 119 genes displaying functional attributes related to cuticle formation/differentiation were positively correlated between A. mellifera and F. varia, and negatively or non-correlated with C. analis, suggesting roles in cuticular maturation heterochrony. However, we also found transcript profiles positively correlated between each one of the eusocial species and C. analis. Gene co-expression networks greatly differed between the bee species, but we identified common gene interactions exclusively between the eusocial species. Except for F. varia, the TEM analysis is consistent with cuticle development timing adapted to the social or solitary life style. In support to our hypothesis, the absolute quantities of n-alkanes and unsaturated CHCs were significantly higher in foragers than in the earlier developmental phases of the eusocial bees, but did not discriminate newly-emerged from foragers in C. analis. By highlighting differences in integument gene expression, cuticle ultrastructure, and CHC profiles between eusocial and solitary bees, our data provided insights into the process of heterochronic cuticle maturation associated to the way of life. © 2019 Falcon et al.

Planning effective enhancements can be informed with pollination service models, but these models should capture the behavioural and spatial dynamics of service-providing organisms. Model predictions, and hence management recommendations, are likely to be sensitive to these dynamics. We used two established models of pollinator foraging to investigate whether habitat enhancement improves crop visitation; whether this effect is influenced by pollinator foraging distance and landscape pattern; and whether behavioural detail improves model predictions. The more detailed central place foraging model better predicted variation in bee visitation observed between habitat types, because it includes optimized trade-offs between patch quality and distance. Both models performed well when predicting visitation rates across broader scales. Using real agricultural landscapes and simulating habitat enhancements, we show that additional floral resources can have diverging effects on predicted crop visitation. When only co-flowering resources were added, optimally foraging bees concentrated in enhancements to the detriment of crop pollination. For both models, adding nesting resources increased crop visitation. Finally, the marginal effect of enhancements was greater in simple landscapes. Synthesis and applications. Model results help to identify the conditions under which habitat enhancements are most likely to increase pollination services in agriculture. Three design principles for pollinator habitat enhancement emerge: (a) enhancing only flowers can diminish services by distracting pollinators away from crops, (b) providing nesting resources is more likely to increase bee populations and crop visitation and (c) the benefit of enhancements will be greatest in landscapes that do not already contain abundant habitat. © 2019 The Authors.

However, colony-level studies on the effects of neonicotinoids in field studies are limited, primarily due to their complexity and the resources required. This paper reports the combined results of two large-scale colony-feeding studies, each with 6 weeks of continuous dosing of 12 colonies per treatment (24 control) to 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50 or 100 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose solution. Exposure continued beyond dosing with residues present in stored nectar and bee-bread. The studies were conducted in an area with limited alternative forage and colonies were required to forage for pollen and additional nectar The studies provide colony-level endpoints: significant effects (reductions in bees, brood) were observed after exposure to the two highest dose rates, colony loss occurred at the highest dose rate, but colonies were able to recover (2–3 brood cycles after the end of dosing) after dosing with 50 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose. No significant colony-level effects were observed at lower dose rates. The data reported here support the conclusions of previous colony-level crop-based field studies with thiamethoxam, in which residues in pollen and nectar were an order of magnitude below the colony-level NOEC of 37.5 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose. The feeding study data are also compared to the outcomes of regulatory Tier 1 risk assessments conducted using guidance provided by the USA, Canada, Brazil and the EU regulatory authorities.

As such, they are susceptible to perturbation by abundant, generalist, non-native pollinators such as the western honey bee (Apis mellifera), which can reach high abundances and visit flowers of many plant species in their expansive introduced range. Despite the prevalence of non-native honey bees, their effects on pollination mutualisms in natural ecosystems remain incompletely understood. Here, we contrast community-level patterns of floral visitation by honey bees with that of the diverse native pollinator fauna of southern California, USA. We show that the number of honey bees visiting plant species increases much more rapidly with flower abundance than does that of non-honey bee insects, such that the percentage of all visitors represented by honey bees increases with flower abundance. Thus, honey bees could disproportionately impact the most abundantly blooming plant species and the large numbers of both specialized and generalized pollinator species that they sustain. Honey bees may preferentially exploit high-abundance floral resources because of their ability to recruit nest-mates; these foraging patterns may cause native insect species to forage on lower-abundance resources to avoid competition. Our results illustrate the importance of understanding foraging patterns of introduced pollinators in order to reveal their ecological impacts. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In addition to the characteristics of agricultural plots, bee assemblages in them are influenced by the adjacent habitats. Perennial, fruit-oriented nopal (Opuntia spp.) orchards cover large surfaces in Mexico, North Africa, South America and southern U.S.A. and produce tens of thousands of flowers, but their value as habitat for bees was unknown. To document bee assemblages in nopal orchards in the Llanos de Ojuelos, southern Mexican Plateau, and to assess the influence of adjacent habitats on them, we surveyed bees in nopal orchards adjacent to cropland (Cr-orchards) and adjacent to natural shrubland patches (Sh-orchards), and in remnants of natural shrubland. We used color traps and manual capture from flowers during the 2016 and 2017 peaks of Opuntia blooming periods. We hypothesized that Sh-orchards would harbor richer and larger native bee assemblages than Cr-orchards, and that assemblages´ similarity between these Sh-orchards and shrublands would be greater than between Cr-orchards and shrublands. We collected 3823 individuals of 45 different bee taxa; 90% of all taxa, in nopal orchards. Our results partially support the premise that proximity of natural habitats to agricultural plots is positive for their bee overall abundance, but distance from shrublands did not impoverish bee species richness. Mean similarity values between Cr-orchards, Sh-orchards, and shrublands were not significantly different, as result of shrubland patches being very variable. As a result of their perennial condition and limited agricultural practices, nopal orchards provide shelter, forage, and nest substrate for native bee species, albeit perhaps less in Cr-orchards than in Sh-orchards, and likely facilitate bee movement between orchards and, or shrublands through a matrix of annual croplands. In doing so, this agroecosystem enhances regional bee community resilience in the context of an anthropized landscape. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

Workers seen inspecting and feeding the brood had well-developed hypopharyngeal glands compared to foragers of their own colony indicating that they are nurses performing nursing behavior. Further, introducing marked 1-day-old workers into the host colony and repeatedly attaching combs with open brood allowed us to estimate the age range of nursing behavior. In our experiments, A. florea workers started to perform significant nursing behavior 8 days after eclosion and continued to show nursing behavior until the age of 28 days, the end of our observation period.

Here, we establish proof-of-concept for a prototype long-range, passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging system for detecting bumblebees and similar sized insects. The prototype tags, weighing 81 mg (49% of mean bee body weight), were flown by bumblebees in a glasshouse and detected at a distance of 1.5 m from a 2 W UHF reader with two aerials. This detection distance is two orders of magnitude greater than existing RFID tags that can be flown by medium-sized bees and, thus, is a significant breakthrough for insect tracking that could be applied to plant conservation and restoration efforts in fragmented landscapes. Proof-of-concept has been successfully established and, with further development, we are likely to optimize the system by reducing tag size and weight to limit effects on bee behaviour, and by increasing the detection distance.

Reduced gene flow is expected to minimize the impact of genetically engineered (GE) crops on feral and natural populations and to facilitate the coexistence of different agricultural markets. The goal of this study is to link foraging behavior to gene flow and identify behaviors that can help predict gene flow for different bee species. To reach this goal, we first examined and compared the foraging behaviors of three distinct bee species, the European honey bee, Apis mellifera L., the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens Cr., and the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata F., foraging on Medicago sativa flowers. Each foraging behavior investigated differed among bee species. Both social bees exhibited directionality of movement and had similar residence, in contrast to the random movement and shorter residence of the solitary bee. Tripping rate and net distance traveled differed among the three bee species. We ranked each behavior among bee species and used the relative ranking as gene flow predictor before testing the predictions against empirical gene flow data. Tripping rate and net distance traveled, but not residence, predicted relative gene dispersal among bee species. Linking specific behaviors to gene flow provides mechanisms to explain differences in gene flow among bee species and guides the development of management practices to reduce gene flow.

Therefore, the internal nest environment is connected to the external environment via foraging.

However, the spatial ecology of B. hypnorum has not previously been investigated. To address this issue, and to investigate whether specific features of the spatial ecology of B. hypnorum are associated with its rapid range expansion, we used 14 microsatellite markers to estimate worker foraging distance, nest density, between-year lineage survival rate and isolation by distance in a representative UK B. hypnorum population.

In addition, genotyping stored sperm dissected from sampled queens confirmed polyandry in this population (mean minimum mating frequency of 1.7 males per queen).

Such communities are widely represented as bipartite networks: graphs depicting interactions between two groups of species, such as plants and pollinators or hosts and parasites. For over thirty years, studies have used indices, such as connectance and species degree, to characterise the structure of these networks and the roles of their constituent species. However, compressing a complex network into a single metric necessarily discards large amounts of information about indirect interactions. Given the large literature demonstrating the importance and ubiquity of indirect effects, many studies of network structure are likely missing a substantial piece of the ecological puzzle. Here we use the emerging concept of bipartite motifs to outline a new framework for bipartite networks that incorporates indirect interactions. While this framework is a significant departure from the current way of thinking about bipartite ecological networks, we show that this shift is supported by analyses of simulated and empirical data. We use simulations to show how consideration of indirect interactions can highlight differences missed by the current index paradigm that may be ecologically important. We extend this finding to empirical plant–pollinator communities, showing how two bee species, with similar direct interactions, differ in how specialised their competitors are. These examples underscore the need to not rely solely on network- and species-level indices for characterising the structure of bipartite ecological networks. © 2018 The Authors",Article,Scopus

In particular, the presence of a rewarding plant species may increase the rate of pollinator visitation to a less rewarding species in its vicinity, but the beneficial increase in visitation may be counteracted by a detrimental increase in heterospecific pollen transfer. We assessed this trade-off using bumble-bees foraging over a gradual spatial transition between two plant species in an indoor cage experiment. Methods: We used two 'species' of artificial flowers - one more rewarding than the other - in arrays that varied in the degree of species intermingling. The flowers dispensed and received powdered food dyes serving as pollen analogues. Captive bumble-bees visited to collect sucrose solution. We quantified dye delivery to the adhesive-tape 'stigmas' in flowers by spectrophotometry. Key Results: Across the spatial transition between species, the less attractive species received more dye (more bee visits) when in proximity to the more attractive species than it did when alone, but the larger dye loads were less pure (more heterospecific pollen transfer). The decline in purity cancelled out the gain in acquisition, so conspecific pollen receipt by the less attractive species was neutrally affected. The more attractive species received fewer visits when surrounded by the less attractive species, so the interaction between the two species was amensalism when considering conspecific pollen reception. Conclusions: Pollinator-mediated interactions between plant species depend on pollination quantity and purity, both of which can depend on spatial intermingling. © 2018 The Author(s).",Article,Scopus

Returning foragers recruit nest mates to a food source by communicating flight distance and direction using a small scale walking pattern: the waggle dance. It is still unclear how bees transpose flight information to generate corresponding dance information. In single feeder shift experiments, we monitored for the first time how individual bees update dance duration after a shift of feeder distance. Interestingly, the majority of bees (86%) needed two or more foraging trips to update dance duration. This finding demonstrates that transposing flight navigation information to dance information is not a reflexive behavior. Furthermore, many bees showed intermediate dance durations during the update process, indicating that honey bees highly likely use two memories: (i) a recently acquired navigation experience and (ii) a previously stored flight experience. Double-shift experiments, in which the feeder was moved forward and backward, created an experimental condition in which honey bee foragers did not update dance duration; suggesting the involvement of more complex memory processes. Our behavioral paradigm allows the dissociation of foraging and dance activity and opens the possibility of studying the molecular and neural processes underlying the waggle dance behavior. © 2019.

Such recruitment is particularly profitable if the source is plentiful and ephemeral, or too large to be transported by a single individual. Ants, termites and some social bees and wasps use pheromones as recruitment signals. Such signals are excreted by individuals that have located a profitable food source, and are deposited on the ground as a continuous trail (ants and termites), left on prominent vegetation (stingless bees), or at the actual food source (some bees and wasps). When recruitment signals are left in the open, others can also eavesdrop on the information. Some social insects therefore have moved their recruitment signaling inside the nest. The most primitive form of in-house recruitment are probably the excitatory movements performed by returning foragers, who often also carry the odor of the food source on them. The most sophisticated form of recruitment is found in honeybees, where the so-called waggle dance conveys directional and distance information to nestmates. Many social insects further use recruitment signals when selecting a new home, but information on nest site selection is scarce, mainly restricted to honeybees and some species of ants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",Book Chapter,Scopus

We found little evidence of autogamy in emasculated inflorescences, and though trees were self-compatible, protandry within inflorescences and synchrony of flowering on branch systems were effective at preventing self-fertilization. Pollen was poorly dispersed by wind, and no pollen was found on traps 8 m from source trees.

Most of the bees studied so far are temperate or tropical species but many ecosystems are predicted to experience increased aridification under climate change. Therefore, we need to understand how pollinator species are likely to respond.

In burned and unburned areas in Montana, USA, we investigated the abundance and diversity of native bees, floral and nesting resources, nesting success, and traits of flowers and bees. In two of the three localities studied, burned areas, including areas that burned with high-severity wildfires, supported higher density and diversity of native bees and the flowers they depend on for food and larval provisioning. Burned areas also had more bare ground for ground-nesting bees and more available coarse woody debris for cavity-nesting bees than unburned areas. Moreover, cavity-nesting bees were completely unsuccessful at nesting in artificial nesting boxes in unburned areas, while nesting success was 40% in burned areas. Mean bee intertegular distance (a trait strongly correlated with tongue length, foraging distance, and body size) was similar between burned and unburned areas. However, wildfires influenced both interspecific and intraspecific trait variation of bees and plants. Intraspecific variation in bee intertegular distance was higher in unburned than burned areas. Both interspecific and intraspecific variation in floral traits important for interactions with pollinators were generally higher in burned than unburned areas. Thus, wildfires generally increased the density and species diversity of bees and flowers as well as trait variation at both trophic levels. We conclude that wildfires-even large, high-severity wildfires-create conditions that support native bees and the resources they need to flourish, but that unburned areas maintain trait variation in landscape mosaics with heterogeneous fire conditions. © 2019 Burkle, Simanonok, Durney, Myers and Belote.",Article,Scopus

A widely accepted yet untested hypothesis states that flowers serve as bridges in the transmission of viruses between bees. Here, using a series of controlled experiments with captive bee colonies, we examined the role of flowers in bee virus transmission. We first examined if honey bees deposit viruses on flowers and whether bumble bees become infected after visiting contaminated flowers. We then examined whether plant species differ in their propensity to harbor viruses and if bee visitation rates increase the likelihood of virus deposition on flowers. Our experiment demonstrated, for the first time, that honey bees deposit viruses on flowers. However, the two viruses we examined, black queen cell virus (BQCV) and deformed wing virus (DWV), were not equally distributed across plant species, suggesting that differences in floral traits, virus ecology and/or foraging behavior may mediate the likelihood of deposition. Bumble bees did not become infected after visiting flowers previously visited by honey bees suggesting that transmission via flowers may be a rare occurrence and contingent on multiplicative factors and probabilities such as infectivity of virus strain across bee species, immunocompetence, virus virulence, virus load, and the probability a bumble bee will contact a virus particle on a flower. Our study is among the first to experimentally examine the role of flowers in bee virus transmission and uncovers promising avenues for future research. © 2019 Alger et al.

Here, we employ pollen metabarcoding of the rbcL gene to compare the foraging patterns of different bee species observed using urban sown wildflower strips in July 2016, with a goal of identifying which plant species are most important for bees.

While navigating within such environments, animals need to perceive and disambiguate environmental features that might obstruct their flight. The most elemental aspect of aerial navigation through such environments is gap identification and ‘passability’ evaluation. We used bumblebees to seek insights into the mechanisms used for gap identification when confronted with an obstacle in their flight path and behavioral compensations employed to assess gap properties. Initially, bumblebee foragers were trained to fly though an unobstructed flight tunnel that led to a foraging chamber. After the bees were familiar with this situation, we placed a wall containing a gap that unexpectedly obstructed the flight path on a return trip to the hive. The flight trajectories of the bees as they approached the obstacle wall and traversed the gap were analyzed in order to evaluate their behavior as a function of the distance between the gap and a background wall that was placed behind the gap. Bumblebees initially decelerated when confronted with an unexpected obstacle. Deceleration was first noticed when the obstacle subtended around 35 deg on the retina but also depended on the properties of the gap. Subsequently, the bees gradually traded off their longitudinal velocity to lateral velocity and approached the gap with increasing lateral displacement and lateral velocity. Bumblebees shaped their flight trajectory depending on the salience of the gap, indicated in our case by the optic flow contrast between the region within the gap and on the obstacle, which decreased with decreasing distance between the gap and the background wall. As the optic flow contrast decreased, the bees spent an increasing amount of time moving laterally across the obstacles. During these repeated lateral maneuvers, the bees are probably assessing gap geometry and passability. © 2019. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd",Article,Scopus

Research has shown that acute, field realistic dosages of neonicotinoids can negatively influence bee learning and memory, with potential consequences for bee behaviour. As legislative reassessment of neonicotinoid use occurs globally, there is an urgent need to understand the potential risk of other systemic insecticides. Sulfoxaflor, the first branded sulfoximine-based insecticide, has the same mode of action as neonicotinoids, and may potentially replace them over large geographical ranges. Here we assessed the impact of acute sulfoxaflor exposure on performance in two paradigms that have previously been used to illustrate negative impacts of neonicotinoid pesticides on bee learning and memory. We assayed whether acute sulfoxaflor exposure influences (a) olfactory conditioning performance in both bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and honeybees (Apis mellifera), using a proboscis extension reflex assay, and (b) working memory performance of bumblebees, using a radial-arm maze. We found no evidence to suggest that sulfoxaflor influenced performance in either paradigm. Our results suggest that despite a shared mode of action between sulfoxaflor and neonicotinoidbased insecticides, widely-documented effects of neonicotinoids on bee cognition may not be observed with sulfoxaflor, at least at acute exposure regimes.

Here, we re-examine the taxonomic and biogeographic affinities of bumble bees from Novaya Zemlya using historical samples and recently collected materials (1895–1925 vs. 2015– 2017). Three bumble bee species inhabit the Yuzhny (Southern) Island and the southern edge of Severny (Northern) Island of this archipelago: Bombus glacialis Friese, 1902, B. hyperboreus Schönherr, 1809, and B. pyrrhopygus Friese, 1902. Bombus glacialis shares three unique COI haplotypes that may indicate its long-term (pre-glacial) persistence on Novaya Zemlya. In contrast, Bombus hyperboreus and B. pyrrhopygus share a rather low molecular divergence from mainland populations, with the same or closely related haplotypes as those from Arctic Siberia and Norway. A brief re-description of Bombus pyrrhopygus based on the newly collected topotypes is presented. Habitats, foraging plants and life cycles of bumble bees on Novaya Zemlya are characterized, and possible causes of extremely low bumble bee abundance on the archipelago are discussed. The species-poor bumble bee fauna of Novaya Zemlya is compared with those in other areas throughout the Arctic. The mean bumble bee species richness on the Arctic Ocean islands is three times lower than that in the mainland Arctic areas (3.1 vs. 8.6 species per local fauna, respectively). General linear models (GLMs) indicate that this difference can be explained by specific environmental conditions of insular areas. Our findings highlight that the insularity is a significant factor sharply decreasing species richness in bumble bee assemblages on the Arctic Ocean archipelagoes through colder climate (lower summer temperatures), prevalence of harsh Arctic tundra landscapes with poor foraging resources, and in isolation from the mainland. © Grigory S.

Information on the potential for bee pollen production of these species is limited. In this study we evaluated the potential of production, the temporal variation, the botanical origin and the nutritional value of bee pollen produced in a seasonal semideciduous forest in northeastern Brazil. We identified a total of 252 flowering plant species throughout the year. The diet of Apis mellifera consisted of 74 pollen types distributed in 58 genera and 27 families. We identified two production peaks of bee pollen, the highest occurring in the rainy season. Nutritional value considering crude protein, carbohydrates, lipids and mineral matter changed over the study period, with influence of rainfall on the dry matter level. Some taxonomic groups of plants showed a strong relationship with nutrients, suggesting that although the diet of A. mellifera is broadly diversified, this species devoted most of its pollen foraging effort on the genus Mimosa and the palm tree species of Attalea speciosa. The results show that the seasonal semideciduous forest of the mountain range in the Northeast Brazil presents plant species: Mimosa caesalpiniifolia, Baccharis trinervis, Mimosa tenuiflora Myracrodruom urundeuva, Cecropia pachystachya, Attalea speciosa, with high nutritional level and potential for the pollen production. © 2019 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

This analysis creates mathematical models for: the collected nectar to honey ratio; energy recovery ratio; honey energy margin; and the break-even distance, which includes the factors of nectar concentration and the distance to the nectar from the nest; energetics of desiccation and a new factor, thermal energy efficiency (TEE) of nectar desiccation. These models show a significant proportion of delivered energy in the nectar must be used in desiccation, and that there is a strong connection between TEE and nest lumped thermal conductance with colony behaviour. They show the connection between TEE and honeybee colony success, or failure, in the rate of return, in terms of distance or quality of foraging. Consequently, TEE is a key parameter in honeybee populations and foraging modelling.

We studied foraging behavior of X. virginica on 14 blueberry cultivars in an experimental planting in Rhode Island, and assessed factors related to slitting frequency, and the effects of slitting on fruit set and blueberry quality.

Furthermore, pollinator availability can be critical for the success of conservation translocations of threatened flora with such interactions. Here, we investigated the pollination biology of the endangered orchid Caladenia versicolor, with the aim of improving management of wild populations and conservation translocations (artificial translocation for conservation). Using portable groups of cultivated plants to attract pollinators, we found that at natural sites C. versicolor is predominantly pollinated by food-foraging males of one species of bee, Leioproctus platycephalus (Colletidae), with only occasional visits from females or other bee species. This apparently high degree of specialization occurred despite the presence of a co-occurring bee community of > 20 species. Although previously thought to be nectarless, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of labellum secretions revealed that C. versicolor produces meagre quantities of sucrose on the upper surface of the labellum, on which some pollinators appeared to feed. Reproductive success was high in C. versicolor at both natural and translocated sites. Although C. versicolor now has a restricted range, L. platycephalus is found across a broad area of southern Australia. Thus, pollinator availability does not appear to have contributed to the rarity of C. versicolor, but the apparent reliance on L. platycephalus means that the availability of this species needs to be taken into account for conservation management and translocations. © 2018 The Linnean Society of London.",Article,Scopus

Pollen colour in Campanula americana is variable and displays a longitudinal cline from prevalence of deep purple in western populations to white and light-purple pollen in eastern populations. While selection for thermal tolerance probably underlies darker pollen in the west, factors contributing to the predominance of light pollen in eastern populations and the maintenance of colour variation within populations throughout the range are unknown. Here we examine whether pollinators contribute to the maintenance of pollen colour variation in C. americana. • Methods In a flight cage experiment, we assessed whether Bombus impatiens foragers can use pollen colour as a reward cue. We then established floral arrays that varied in the frequency of white- and purple-pollen plants in two naturally occurring eastern populations. We observed foraging patterns of wild bees, totalling >1100 individual visits. • Key Results We successfully trained B. impatiens to prefer one pollen colour morph. In natural populations, the specialist pollinator, Megachile campanulae, displayed a strong and consistent preference for purple-pollen plants regardless of morph frequency. Megachile also exhibited a bias toward pollen-bearing male-phase flowers, and this bias was more pronounced for purple pollen. The other main pollinators, Bombus spp. and small bees, did not display pollen colour preference. • Conclusions Previous research found that Megachile removes twice as much pollen per visit as other bees and can deplete pollen from natural populations. Taken together, these results suggest that Megachile could reduce the reproductive success of plants with purple pollen, resulting in the prevalence of light-coloured pollen in eastern populations of C. americana. Our research demonstrates that pollinator preferences may play a role in the maintenance of pollen colour variation in natural populations. © The Author(s) 2018.",Article,Scopus

However, the effects of organic farming on honeybees remain elusive, despite honeybees’ importance as pollinators of crops and wild plants. Using 6 years of data from a large-scale study with fortnightly measurements of honeybee colony performance traits (10 apiaries per year distributed across a 435 km2-large research site in France), we related worker brood area, number of adult bees and honey reserves to the proportions of organic farmland in the surroundings of the hives at two spatial scales (300 m and 1,500 m). We found evidence that, at the local scale, organic farming increased both worker brood production and number of adult bees in the period of flower scarcity between the blooms of oilseed rape and sunflower (hereafter ‘dearth period’). At the landscape scale, organic farming increased honey reserves during the dearth period and at the beginning of the sunflower bloom. The results suggest that worker brood development benefitted from organic farming mostly through a more diverse diet due to an increase in the availability of diverse pollen sources in close proximity of their hives. Reduced pesticide drift may have additionally improved bee survival. Honey reserves were possibly mostly affected by increased availability of melliferous flowers in foraging distance. Synthesis and applications. Organic farming increases honeybee colony performance in a period of resource scarcity, likely through a continuous supply of floral resources including weeds, cover crops and semi-natural elements. We demonstrate how worker brood area increases in the critical dearth period (between the blooms of oilseed rape and sunflower). This has previously been linked to winter colony survival, suggesting that organic farmland may mitigate repercussions of intensive farming on colony vitality.

Sulfoxaflor is a recently developed systemic insecticide in the new sulfoximine class of insecticides and has shown high efficiency against a wide range of pest insects. The main objective of this study was therefore to assess the effects of sulfoxaflor on the buff-tailed or large earth bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), known as an important generalist pollinator of wild plants and many agricultural crops worldwide. To achieve this objective, a laboratory bioassay with queenless bumblebee microcolonies that had been previously developed and used to assess for both toxicity and effects on foraging behaviour in B. terrestris for neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam), was specifically employed. Here, microcolonies of B. terrestris workers, with or without the need to forage for food, were exposed to sugar water supplemented with field-realistic concentrations of sulfoxaflor (starting from 15 µg/ml to 5 and 1 µg/ml) via oral exposure during 15 days. In addition to a significant reduction in bumblebee worker survival, the results also indicated that there was no higher toxicity caused by sulfoxaflor when the bumblebees had to forage for their food compared to when they did not have to forage. These results could guide future studies in this context and could be used in debates on insecticides and/or risk assessment of pesticides with potential effects on behaviour in bumblebees and other pollinators in general. © 2019 E.

In the next step of fabrication, building compact models and developing parameter extraction methods have critical importance in designing electronic circuits using fabricated OFETs. In this paper, we propose a parameter extraction approach which benefits from the power of metaheuristics. Although direct extraction tools offer analytical solutions in successive steps to extract model parameters, metaheuristics-based global optimization methods can find all parameters at once by exploring a wide range of parameters. Direct extraction tools are cumbersome and need human expertise. On the other hand, global optimization methods are very flexible, adaptive and can be automated as parameter extraction tools of any compact model. In this study, we introduce three different global optimization algorithms, namely, a genetic algorithm (GA), a hybrid artificial bee colony (h-ABC) algorithm, and bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) algorithm, for the parameter extraction. To the best of our knowledge, h-ABC and BFO algorithms have been used for the first time in extracting parameters of OFET compact models. We use two OFET compact models developed by Estrada et al. and Marinov et al. for two different datasets of OFET transistors, both having pentacene as organic semiconductor. While one of the dataset of transistor (T1) is available in literature, the dataset of the other transistor fabricated in our laboratory (T2) is generated as a new dataset. In order to tune control parameters of the developed algorithms, Taguchi's orthogonal experimental design (OED) method is used. Experimental results show that the proposed metaheuristics-based approach can extract model parameters successfully and can perform better than direct extraction methods. The studied OFET compact models fit to the experimental data with these parameters and predict similar output characteristic curves. The algorithms show a good agreement with the experimental data of T1 and T2, having normalized root-mean-square error values under 3.70%, and 8.74% for the models of Estrada et al. and Marinov et al., respectively. It is shown that h-ABC and BFO algorithms perform better than GA on average. It is also observed that the compact model by Estrada et al. performs better for both T1 and T2 compared to the model of Marinov et al. © 2019 IEEE.",Article,Scopus

Recently, a honeybee pest, the small hive beetle Aethina tumida (hereafter SHB), has been reported in Italy, where it colonized more than 50 apiaries in an area of about 300 km 2 . SHB is a nest parasite and scavenger of honeybee colonies native of Sub-Saharian Africa. Likely being helped by the globalization of apiculture, SHB underwent several invasions in the last twenty years, causing locally relevant economic impact. While many features of its biology have been addressed, an important knowledge gap concerns the spatial invasion dynamics in invaded areas. In this paper we coupled two spatial analysis techniques (geographic profiling and a density-based spatial clustering algorithm) to uncover the possible invasion pattern of SHB in Italy. We identified the port town of Gioia Tauro as the most likely point from which SHB may have spread and suggested the possible successive axes of diffusion. These putative diffusion paths suggest that the SHB spread in south Italy might have been due to a mix of natural dispersal between close apiaries and longer distance movement through faster, likely human-mediated, communication routes. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Entomologia",Article,Scopus

Although, as most techniques are based on the image histogram to be segmented, MT approaches only include the occurrence frequency of particular intensity range disregarding each spatial information. Energy curve-based contextual information can help to improve the quality of the thresholded image as it computes not only the value of the pixel but also its vicinity. Therefore, the energy curve is intended to carry spatial information into a curve with the same properties as the histogram. In this paper, classical Otsu’s method (between-class variance) is combined with energy curve for multilevel thresholding to perform segmentation of colored images. The energy curve-based Otsu (Energy-Otsu) uses an exhaustive search process to determine the optimal threshold values. However, due to the multidimensionality and multimodal nature of the color images, it becomes challenging and highly complex to obtain optimal thresholds. Therefore, the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm is coupled with Otsu thresholding criteria to perform MT over the energy curve. The proposed Energy-Otsu-CS method produces better-segmented results as compared to other well-known optimization algorithms such as differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, firefly algorithm, bacterial foraging optimization, and artificial bee colony algorithm. The proposed approach is examined intensively regarding quality, and the numerical parameter analysis is presented to compare the segmented results of the algorithms against closely related current approaches such as gray-level co-occurrence matrix and Renyi’ entropy-based thresholding approaches. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Article,Scopus

It has been demonstrated that ants can optimize their foraging path through an emergent process, involving the trail pheromone concentration, without individual ants having to measure and compare distances. In the current study, we investigated whether ants that use only tandem running to recruit their nestmates can minimize their path while relocating their entire colony into a new nest. As colony relocation directly impacts the survival of the whole colony, it would be particularly important to optimize their path to the new nest. Using the ponerine ant Diacamma indicum, we conducted relocation experiments, in which ants had to choose between different defined paths, and contrasted our findings with open arena experiments, as they navigated to their new nest. After following 4100 unique transports by 450 different transporters, we found that these ants do minimize their path. Individual leaders, as well as colonies, chose the shorter path significantly more than the longer path, and they showed a significant preference for the shorter arm at multiple decision points on encountering a combination of paths. Thus, we concluded that tandem leaders are capable of path minimization based on the information they themselves collect. Further investigation into the proximate mechanisms by which they achieve this is required. © 2019. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd",Article,Scopus

Mostly unanticipated, however, has been the application of the approach to areas outside of biology. OFT has inspired developments in a wide range of fields. Investigators have applied OFT to an amazing range of human endeavors both within biology and farther afield; including resource conservation and management, archaeology, criminology, gambling, searching the internet, development of computer software, and a wide variety of other human activities. The literature in relation to these areas is substantial and growing, with general agreement that OFT helps significantly. Inspiration by OFT has emerged from a combination of the following three ideas: foraging organisms face problems that are analogous to problems that humans commonly confront; organisms have evolved ‘solutions’, possibly optimal ones, to these pervasive problems; analogous solutions may help to solve the human situations that involve optimization. However, by necessity and without detracting from the usefulness of this approach, these models make assumptions that are not based on known biology and in the end do not really include much biology. None-the-less, a wide array of organisms has provided inspiration for solving many different human technology problems that involve optimization. Any human problem that involves climbing gradients towards maxima would seem well suited to OFT-inspired models or algorithms. The array of organisms that have been used as inspiration for solving such human problems is truly amazing, and has included bacteria, ants, cuckoos, honeybees, spiders, hummingbirds, bats, frogs, and even plant roots. OFT has also inspired research in other areas that do not involve optimization but include conceptual similarities between situations faced by foraging animals and certain human situations; most of these have so far been medically-related. Models or algorithms, generated in the context of human optimization, could be used to develop and test predictions in terms of animal foraging, but so far this has apparently not been attempted. Such integration between OFT and human optimization therefore awaits further research. Application and inspiration of OFT into areas outside the traditional realm of biology and into human technology have been almost completely unanticipated. One might have anticipated the application into archaeology, but who would have guessed that OFT would ultimately be applied into the worlds of criminals, drug addicts, and computer users! Perhaps OFT will provide future application and inspiration in ways yet to be imagined!. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.",Book Chapter,Scopus

We aimed to detect the main factors that should be considered in a multiple-scale approach for small forest patches in order to contribute to the conservation plans for stingless bees. The study was conducted in small forest patches of the Atlantic Forest, in the municipality of Salto de Pirapora (SP, Brazil). The spatial analysis was developed based on forest patch size, forest patch core size, distance from the nearest forest patch, and distance from the nearest body of water. Based on these criteria, we selected three hotspot forest patches (including all criteria that favor the presence of stingless bees with arboreal nesting habits) and three control forest patches (which does not fulfill all these criteria), and we evaluated the presence of stingless bees based on the occupation of artificial shelters installed in the patches. From the 72 installed artificial shelters, we observed 27 shelters (37.5%) carrying some association with stingless bees presence. Bees showed a preference for occupying artificial shelters that were located in the patches’ cores (66.7%). The structure and composition of the vegetation showed great importance to the occupation of the artificial shelters, as there was a strong correlation between the occupied shelters and the diameter and the height of the trees. There was also a correlation between the presence of grasses and shrubs (p < 0.05), which were the main providers of floral resources. The data of the land cover was an essential factor for the development of spatial analysis, and we found a strong negative correlation with pastures and a positive correlation with forestry (p < 0.05). To elaborate multiscale approaches, it is essential to evaluate the quality of foraging (amount of flowers) and nesting (diameter and height of trees) resources, as well as the surroundings of the patches.

Here, we conducted the first species-specific assessment of future climate change impacts on North American bumblebee distributions, using the most recent global change scenarios developed in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We assessed potential shifts in bumblebee species distributions with models generated using Maxent. We tested different assumptions about bumblebee species’ dispersal capacities, drawing on observed patterns of range shifts to date, dispersal rates observed for bumblebee queens, and, lastly, assuming unlimited dispersal. Models show significant contractions of current ranges even under scenarios in which dispersal rates were high. Results suggest that dispersal rates may not suffice for bumblebees to track climate change as rapidly as required under any IPCC scenario for future climate change. Areas where species losses are projected overlap for many species and climate scenarios, and are concentrated in eastern parts of the continent. Models also show overlap for range expansions across many species, suggesting the presence of “hotspots” where management activities could benefit many species, across all climate scenarios.

In this study, we surveyed wild bees and quantified their nectar and pollen foraging success in a rosemary Mediterranean scrubland in southern France, under different conditions of apiary size and proximity. We found that high-density beekeeping triggers foraging competition which depresses not only the occurrence (-55%) and nectar foraging success (-50%) of local wild bees but also nectar (-44%) and pollen (-36%) harvesting by the honeybees themselves. Overall, those competition effects spanned distances of 600-1.100 m around apiaries, i.e. covering 1.1-3.8km2 areas. Regardless the considered competition criterion, setting distance thresholds among apiaries appeared more tractable than setting colony density thresholds for beekeeping regulation. Moreover, the intraspecific competition among the honeybees has practical implications for beekeepers. It shows that the local carrying capacity has been exceeded and raises concerns for honey yields and colony sustainability. It also offers an effective ecological criterion for pragmatic decision-making whenever conservation practitioners envision progressively reducing beekeeping in protected areas. Although specific to the studied area, the recommendations provided here may help raise consciousness about the threat high-density beekeeping may pose to local nature conservation initiatives, especially in areas with sensitive or endangered plant or bee species such as small oceanic islands with high levels of endemism. © 2018 The Author(s).",Article,Scopus

Although the short-lived plant Aquilegia canadensis produces large, complex, nectar-rich flowers, 75% of seed, on average, are self-fertilized. Previous experimental results are consistent with the fine-scale SGS expected in selfing populations. In contrast, key floral traits show no evidence of SGS, despite a significant genetic basis to phenotypic variation within populations. In this study, we attempt to resolve these contradictory results by hierarchically sampling plants from two plots nested within each of seven rock outcrops distributed over several km, and comparing the spatial pattern of phenotypic variation in four floral traits with neutral genetic variation at 10 microsatellite loci. For both floral and microsatellite variation, we detected only weak hierarchical structuring and no isolation by distance. The spatial pattern of variation in floral traits was on par with microsatellite polymorphisms. These results suggest regular long-distance gene flow via pollen. At much finer spatial scales within plots, estimates of relatedness were higher (albeit very low) between nearest neighbors than random plants, and declined with increasing distance between neighbors, which is consistent with highly localized seed dispersal. High selfing should yield SGS, but strong inbreeding depression in A. canadensis likely erodes SGS so that reproductive plants exhibit weak structure typical of outcrossers, especially given that outcrossing and consequent gene flow in this species are mediated by strong-flying hummingbirds and bumble bees. © 2018, The Genetics Society.",Article,Scopus

Thus the term ‘forager’ encompasses multiple distinct behaviors that rely on different sensory modalities. Despite a robust literature on bumblebee foraging behavior, few studies are directly relevant to sensory-guided search; i.e. how workers locate novel patches. The first step in answering this question is to determine what sensory information is available to searching bumblebees. This manuscript presents a computational model that elucidates the relative frequency of visual and olfactory cues that are available to workers searching for floral resources under a range of ecologically relevant scenarios. Model results indicate that odor is the most common sensory cue encountered during search flights. When the likelihood of odor-plume contact is higher, odor-encounter is ubiquitous. While integrative (visual + olfactory) cues are common when foragers are searching for larger flowers (e.g. Echinacea), they become rare when foragers are searching for small flowers (e.g. Penstemon). Visual cues are only encountered in isolation when foragers are seeking large flowers with a low odor-plume contact probability. These results indicate that despite the multisensory nature of floral signals, different modalities may be encountered in isolation during search-behavior, as opposed to the reliably multimodal signals encountered during patch-exploitation or nectar/ pollen acquisition. © 2018, The Author(s).",Article,Scopus

Here, we test for pollination by mimicry in Diuris (Orchidaceae), a genus hypothesized to attract pollinators via mimicry of a range of co-occurring pea plants (Faboideae). Methods: Observations of pollinator behaviour were made for Diuris brumalis using arrays of orchid flowers. An analysis of floral traits in the co-flowering community and spectral reflectance measurements were undertaken to test if Di. brumalis and the pea plants showed strong similarity and were likely to be perceived as the same by bees. Pollen removal and fruit-set were recorded at 18 sites over two years to test if fitness of Di. brumalis increased with the abundance of the model species. Key Results: Diuris brumalis shares the pollinator species Trichococolletes capillosus and T. leucogenys (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) with co-flowering Faboideae from the genus Daviesia. On Di. brumalis, Trichocolletes exhibited the same stereotyped food-foraging and mate-patrolling behaviour that they exhibit on Daviesia. Diuris and pea plants showed strong morphological similarity compared to the co-flowering plant community, while the spectral reflectance of Diuris was similar to that of Daviesia spp. Fruit-set and pollen removal of Di. brumalis was highest at sites with a greater number of Daviesia flowers. Conclusions: Diuris brumalis is pollinated by mimicry of co-occurring congeneric Faboideae species. Evidence for mimicry of multiple models, all of which share pollinator species, suggests that this may represent a guild mimicry system. Interestingly, Di. brumalis belongs to a complex of species with similar floral traits, suggesting that this represents a useful system for investigating speciation in lineages that employ mimicry of food plants.",Article,Scopus

In the present study, using LC-MS-based combined with GC–MS-based metabolomic approaches, we profiled the metabolic changes that occur in the head of honey bee after subchronic exposure to 2 mg/L thiacloprid over 3 days. The estimated total dose of thiacloprid fed to each bee was 0.12 μg. The results showed that there were 115 metabolites significantly affected in thiacloprid-treated bees compared to control. The metabolites with high level of abundance enriched to wide range pathways associated with oxidative stress and detoxification suggest that the honey bees have activated their detoxification system to resistant toxicity of thiacloprid.

However, frequent tillage results in the degradation of habitat quality and the provision of biodiversity-based ecosystem services. Wild bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants and depend on both, floral resources and suitable nesting sites, which are influenced by the landscape configuration. We examined effects of field and landscape parameters on wild bee species’ richness, abundance and functional traits in Austrian vineyards over two years using Generalised Linear Mixed models, Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Random Forests. Alternating tillage was compared with no tillage in two inter-rows per vineyard. Forage availability in these inter-rows was estimated by flower coverage at each sampling date, and landscape features were analysed within a radius of 750 m around the vineyards. Across all vineyards we found 84 wild bee species with a mean abundance (±SD) of 29 (±16.6). Forage availability had the strongest positive effect on wild bee diversity and abundance. In comparison to no tillage, alternating tillage slightly increased wild bee diversity and abundance. Eusocial wild bees were more abundant in untilled inter-rows, whereas solitary wild bees were more closely associated with alternating tilled vineyards. At the landscape scale, the percentage of artificial areas (mostly villages) and distance to semi-natural elements raised wild bee diversity and abundance. The proportion of woodland increased the abundance of wild bees, in particular of eusocial taxa. Solitary wild bee abundance was enhanced by the number of solitary trees. Pollination provided by wild bees in viticultural areas can be enhanced by maintaining a diversity of different soil management strategies to improve forage availability in vineyards. Furthermore, semi-natural elements such as fallows or solitary trees providing floral resources and nesting habitat should be preserved within viticultural landscapes. © 2018 The Authors",Article,Scopus

Co-located soil and dust samples were simultaneously analysed with the objective of determining if the bees or their products had potential application as a proxy for monitoring environmental contamination. The most significant relationships were found between Pb concentrations in honey (r = 0.814, p = 0.014) and wax (r = 0.883, p = 0.004) and those in co-located dust samples. In addition, Zn concentrations in honey and soil were significantly associated (r = 0.709, p = 0.049). Lead isotopic compositions of native bee products collected from background sites adjacent to Sydney national parks (206Pb/207Pb = 1.144, 208Pb/207Pb = 2.437) corresponded to local geogenic rock and soil values (206Pb/207Pb = 1.123–1.176, 208Pb/207Pb = 2.413–2.500). By contrast, inner Sydney metropolitan samples, including native bees and wax (206Pb/207Pb = 1.072–1.121, 208Pb/207Pb = 2.348–2.409), co-located soil and dust (206Pb/207Pb = 1.090–1.122, 208Pb/207Pb = 2.368–2.403), corresponded most closely to aerosols collected during the period of leaded petrol use (206Pb/207Pb = 1.067–1.148, 208Pb/207Pb = 2.341–2.410). A large range of Pb isotopic compositions in beehive samples suggests that other legacy sources, such as Pb-based paints and industrials, may have also contributed to Pb contamination in beehive samples. Native bee data were compared to corresponding samples from the more common European honey bee (Apis mellifera). Although Pb isotopic compositions were similar in both species, significant differences in trace element concentrations were evident across the trace element suite, the bees and their products. The statistical association between T. carbonaria and co-located environmental contaminant concentrations were stronger than those in European honey bees, which may be attributable to its smaller foraging distance (0.3–0.7 km versus 5–9 km, respectively). This implies that T. carbonaria may be more suitable for assessing small spatial scale variations of trace element concentrations than European honey bees. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

The essence of these processes is the movement of propagules from a parental tree to the site of propagule establishment. The estimation of plant dispersal kernels has remained challenging due to the difficulty of making direct observations. We estimated the dispersal capacity of the endangered palm Euterpe edulis, whose seeds are dispersed by vertebrates and pollen by insects. Methods: We used a hierarchical Bayesian model with genetic data from reproductive plants, juveniles, and embryos to estimate dispersal kernels. Our analyses account for genotyping error and uncertainty in parental assignment. Key Results: We found that seeds were dispersed at most a few hundred meters, but pollen was dispersed up to several kilometers. We hypothesize that this long-distance pollen dispersal is generated mainly by euglossine bees, whereas the main dispersal vectors for short-distance seed dispersal are thrushes. The long-distance dispersal of pollen suggests a high level of gene flow that should maintain genetic diversity of E. edulis. Despite the relation between long-distance dispersal and genetic diversity, we observed low genetic diversity and inbreeding within the local population, which are probably due to restricted gene flow due to the low density of this population and its aggregated spatial distribution. Conclusions: We conclude that if conservation actions are able to restore the population density of E. edulis, the recovery of its genetic diversity will be facilitated because of its high dispersal capacity, especially with regard to pollen. © 2018 Botanical Society of America",Article,Scopus

A survey of hygienic behaviour and brood diseases was conducted on 649 colonies in eastern Australia to initiate a selective breeding program targeting disease resistance and provide a level of resistance to Varroa (Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman and V. jacobsoni Oudemans) mites should they become established in Australia. The test population showed a remarkably high baseline level of hygienic behaviour with 17% of colonies meeting or exceeding breeding selection thresholds. Colonies belonging to a breeding program were 5.8 times more likely to be highly hygienic and colonies headed by queens raised from hygienic queen mothers were 2.2 times more likely. Nectar availability (nectar yielding flowering plants within honey bee forage range) influenced hygienic behaviour expression but was not a significant predictor of level of hygienic behaviour. Surprisingly, hygienic behaviour was not a significant predictor of the presence of infection of the honey bee brood disease chalkbrood (Ascosphaera apis) and was not influential in predicting severity of chalkbrood infection in surveyed honey bee colonies.

Evidence is emerging that sublethal doses of these neurotoxins are affecting the learning and memory of both wild and managed bee colonies, exacerbating the negative effects of pesticide exposure and reducing individual foraging efficiency. Variation in methodologies and interpretation of results across studies has precluded the quantitative evaluation of these impacts that is needed to make recommendations for policy change. It is not clear whether robust effects occur under acute exposure regimes (often argued to be more field-realistic than the chronic regimes upon which many studies are based), for field-realistic dosages, and for pesticides other than neonicotinoids. Here we use meta-analysis to examine the impact of pesticides on bee performance in proboscis extension-based learning assays, the paradigm most commonly used to assess learning and memory in bees. We draw together 104 (learning) and 167 (memory) estimated effect sizes across a diverse range of studies. We detected significant negative effects of pesticides on learning and memory (i) at field realistic dosages, (ii) under both chronic and acute application, and (iii) for both neonicotinoid and non-neonicotinoid pesticides groups. We also expose key gaps in the literature that include a critical lack of studies on non-Apis bees, on larval exposure (potentially one of the major exposure routes), and on performance in alternative learning paradigms. Policy implications. Procedures for the registration of new pesticides within EU member states now typically require assessment of risks to pollinators if potential target crops are attractive to bees. However, our results provide robust quantitative evidence for subtle, sublethal effects, the consequences of which are unlikely to be detected within small-scale prelicensing laboratory or field trials, but can be critical when pesticides are used at a landscape scale. Our findings highlight the need for long-term postlicensing environmental safety monitoring as a requirement within licensing policy for plant protection products. © 2018 The Authors.

In plants, contemporary pollen flow is typically modelled as a single spatial process, with pollen flow declining exponentially within a short distance of mother plants. However, growing evidence suggests that many species do not conform to these patterns, often showing an excess of long-distance dispersal events or sometimes even multimodality in dispersal kernels. This suggests that a single function might be insufficient to capture the true complexity of pollination, which in reality is often achieved by multiple pollinators that vary in their foraging ranges and interactions with the landscape. We reconstructed realized pollen flow and assessed pollen immigration for seven populations of the insect-pollinated herb Pulsatilla vulgaris. We quantified the effects of distance, floral resources and landscape composition over multiple spatial scales and tested the hypotheses that within-population pollen flow is related to resources and landscape context measured locally, and that among-population pollen flow is related to features measured at larger spatial scales. We found that pollen flow within populations was more likely to occur amongst near neighbours, but that among-population pollen flow was random with respect to source populations. We further found that local floral density could explain patterns of within-population pollination distances and population-level selfing rates, whereas pollen immigration rates were best explained by the proportion of forest within a radius of 500 m around focal populations. Synthesis. Together, our results suggest that within- and among-population contemporary pollen flow may be governed by different underlying processes, possibly related to differences in the foraging range and habitat use of bee species that contribute to pollination at different scales. This highlights the critical need for researchers to take a more pollinator-eyed view of contemporary pollen flow in plants by (1) recognizing that within- and among-population gene flow by pollen may depend on different sets of pollinators that respond to features at different spatial scales (2) considering additional factors that may alter attractiveness, detectability and accessibility of plants to pollinators beyond the effects of distance. © 2018 The Authors.

Despite the threat to pollination posed by tropical deforestation, it remains an understudied process. In particular, little is known about these dynamics in multi-paternal, successional plant species whose fruits can contain substantial genetic diversity. Given the importance of successional plants in reforestation, quantifying the factors that impact their reproduction is essential for understanding plant gene flow in the context of global change. In this study, we investigated pollen-mediated gene flow at the multi-paternal fruit level to quantify how tropical pollinators navigate and mediate gene flow in altered forests. Utilizing microsatellite genotyping and paternity analyses, we revealed that distinct plant neighborhood and individual factors drive pollen dispersal at the intra-fruit scale. Variance in pollen dispersal distances was greater for neighborhoods with higher conspecific density, indicating that density dependent reproductive patterns play a role at this scale. Additionally, both the diversity and evenness of sires mediated by a single pollinator were affected by the size of the mother tree, that is, larger mothers received pollen from a less diverse, less even pool of sires per fruit. Pollinator body size was not found to be a significant driver of pollen dispersal, indicating that both small- and large-bodied pollinators were equally important pollen dispersers at this scale. By exploring patterns of variation at the intra-fruit level, we show that conspecific density and tree size significantly impact multi-paternal pollen-mediated gene flow, reinforcing the importance of investigating intraspecific, intra-individual variance in plant reproduction. © 2018 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation",Article,Scopus

Bombus ephippiatus, a widespread species mostly found in mountains in the Neotropics, seems to use the highlands as island, and deforested lowland areas may represent barriers to their dispersal, leading to isolation and potentially loss of genetic diversity. Yet, lack of knowledge of its population structure does not allow adequate management and conservation. To fill this knowledge gap, we assessed the population structure and inferred dispersion of B. ephippiatus in two mountain-ranges in Guatemala (Volcanic Chain and Sierra de las Minas). This region is characterized by high topographic variation and considerable deforestation strain. We analyzed the effects of elevation and land-use on genetic differentiation of B. ephippiatus populations and inferred its demography in the region. Our results suggest that B. ephippiatus is able to disperse long distances across most landscape types, reflected by its high genetic diversity, high effective population size, considerable gene flow, low population differentiation, as well as the lack of isolation by distance. Hence, B. ephippiatus may be a resilient species for the provision of pollination services. However, we detected a subtle divergence of B. ephippiatus into two clusters, of which Sierra de las Minas has been identified as a regional hotspot of genetic and species endemism. Yet, differentiation is very recent and hence likely caused by lowland deforestation. The combined effects of current forest cover and elevation partially explain the observed subtle patterns of differentiation suggesting that the maintenance of suitable habitat is crucial to ensure population connectivity of this keystone pollinator. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Article,Scopus

Effective Integrated Crop Pollination (ICP) involves adaptable, targeted and cost-effective management of crop pollination and encourages the use of both wild and managed pollinators where appropriate. In this study we investigate how the addition of honeybee hives affects the community of insects visiting oilseed rape, and if hive number and location affect pollinator foraging and oilseed rape pollination in order to provide evidence for effective ICP. We found that introducing hives increased overall flower visitor numbers and altered the pollinator community, which became dominated by honeybees. Furthermore a greater number of hives did not increase bee numbers significantly but did result in honeybees foraging further into fields. The timing of surveys and proximity to the field edge influenced different pollinators in different ways and represents an example of spatial and temporal complementarity. For example dipteran flower visitor numbers declined away from the field edge whereas honeybees peaked at intermediate distances into the field. Furthermore, no significant effects of survey round on wild bees overall was observed but honeybee numbers were relatively lower during peak flowering and dipteran abundance was greater in later survey rounds. Thus combining diverse wild pollinators and managed species for crop pollination buffers spatial and temporal variation in flower visitation. However we found no effect of insect pollination on seed set or yield of oilseed rape in our trial, highlighting the critical need to understand crop demand for insect pollination before investments are made in managing pollination services. © 2018 Gesellschaft für Ökologie",Article,Scopus

This study quantified how dietary exposures to environmentally-relevant levels of a neonicotinoid insecticide (imidacloprid) affected foraging and nest building of the western harvester ant over 14 days. Using a replicated design, statistically-significant reductions in ant foraging success (50% or greater) occurred at concentrations as low as 50 ppb compared to controls. Both the number of ants entering the maze and the percentage of foraging ants able to locate food were impacted by imidacloprid exposure. Ants exposed to 50 ppb also took three times longer than controls to find food in a test maze. This concentration is among the lowest levels of imidacloprid reported to affect ants and is well within the range of concentrations found in pollen and nectar of imidacloprid-treated plants. Ant foraging success was also impaired at comparable levels as those reported for the honey bee. Although more refinement and research are needed, results from this study suggest that the western harvester ant may be useful for screening the effects of neurotoxic chemicals on their navigation and foraging, two behaviors which are critical to maintaining colony health of ants and the ecological services they provide. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Scopus

To date, most studies of bumblebee habitat requirements have examined static relationships between worker abundance and habitat characteristics. However, if habitat types are linked by dispersal, source-sink dynamics could alter overall population sensitivity to habitat loss, changing conclusions from static approaches. Here, we used empirically derived spatial matrix models to study source-sink population dynamics of bumblebees in heterogeneous environments. We used these models to assess population sensitivity to habitat loss and to examine the population dynamics that could occur under rapid habitat change. Loss of natural habitat reduced long-term population growth rates, and more natural habitat was required to sustain bumblebee species with long-distance dispersal than species with short-distance dispersal. The long-term relative density of colonies in each habitat type depended on landscape structure and bumblebee dispersal ability. Under most conditions, high-quality habitat contained higher densities of colonies than low-quality habitats. However, low-quality habitat could contain higher densities than high-quality habitats if populations were in long-term decline. Rapid loss or restoration of natural habitat produced transient population dynamics that differed from long-term dynamics. After large landscape perturbations that affected population structure, transient dynamics persisted for 4–8 years and were longest for species with short dispersal in highly aggregated landscapes. While transient dynamics were short in duration, they caused large effects on long-term population density. Synthesis and applications. When habitats are linked by dispersal or populations have recently experienced perturbations, patterns of abundance on the landscape may not reflect variation in habitat quality. Spatially structured matrix population models are practical tools than can be used to account for nonequilibrium and source-sink dynamics. For bumblebees, population sensitivity to habitat loss and the duration of transient dynamics depend on dispersal ability and landscape configuration. Demographic approaches such as ours can help to disentangle population patterns from processes and will therefore be valuable for guiding conservation and management. © 2018 The Authors.

One of the most widely used group of pesticides are neonicotinoids, used in treatments of various plants, e.g. oilseed crops, corn and apples, to prevent crop damage by agricultural insect pests. Treatment effects have been found to spill over to non-target insects, such as bees, and more recently also to other animal groups, among them passerine birds. Very little is known, however, on the presence of neonicotinoids in other wild species at higher trophic levels. We present results on the presence of neonicotinoid residues in blood samples of a long-distant migratory food-specialist raptor, the European honey buzzard. Further, we investigate the spatial relationship between neonicotinoid residue prevalence in honey buzzards with that of crop fields where neonicotinoids are typically used. A majority of all blood samples contained neonicotinoids, thiacloprid accounting for most of the prevalence. While neonicotinoid residues were detected in both adults and nestlings, the methodological limit of quantification was exceeded only in nestlings. Neonicotinoids were present in all sampled nests. Neonicotinoid presence in honey buzzard nestlings’ blood matched spatially with the presence of oilseed plant fields. These are the first observations of neonicotinoids in a diurnal raptor.

Honey bees and bumble bees are eusocial central place foragers. Honey bees have large perennial colonies while bumble bee colonies are annual and considerably smaller. Foraging range, body size, and division of labor also vary between these two bee species. Honey bees use their unique dance language to recruit foragers to the most profitable patches. Bumble bees exploit patches individually and develop trapline foraging patterns. We expect such differences among bee species to engender differences in foraging activity. Moreover, variation in resource availability and in colony needs over the flowering season, can affect bee foraging activity. Finally, spatial variation in resource availability may impact bumble bees to a greater extent than honey bees due to their smaller foraging range. Using miniaturized radio frequency identification (RFID), we tracked the foraging activity of individual bees to and from hives at three sites and over five time periods. Pollen pellets were also collected from bees returning to the hive. We compared the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, and the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. Linear mixed effect models determined the impact of bee species, time of season (period) and site, and their interactions, on multiple foraging metrics calculated from the RFID data and on pollen dry weight. Relative to honey bees, individual bumble bees made more foraging trips each day, resulting in a greater time spent foraging. A greater proportion of RFID tagged bumble bees foraged each day and bumble bees brought heavier pollen sacs to the hive compared to honey bees. Foraging bout duration did not vary between bee species and none of the foraging metrics varied among time periods or among sites. Both bee species brought heavier pollen sacs back to the hive at the beginning and the end of the flowering season. These results are discussed in terms of species differences in foraging strategies, size of individuals and colonies, and temporal variation in colony needs and resource availability. © 2018 Minahan and Brunet.",Article,Scopus

In agricultural ecosystems, productivity is related not only to the taxonomic diversity of bees per se, but also to the location of their nesting sites, which has impact on their flight range. Within this context, the present study sought to assess how wild bee assemblages affect the yield of Brassica napus at three different distances (25 m, 175 m and 325 m) from forest remnants in Southern Brazil. Pan traps were employed to sample bees, and data analysis was carried out using the Shannon diversity index and generalized linear models. We identified 11 species of native bees, both solitary and social, and high prevalence of the exotic species Apis mellifera L. Our findings show that canola crop yield was positively influenced by the diversity of bee species, demonstrating that native bees, not only A. mellifera, can greatly contribute to the productivity of canola crops. In addition, it was found that bee body size is significantly associated with flight distance travelled within the canola fields, and indicated a relationship with nesting sites. Thus, we hypothesize that higher canola yields are associated with increased presence of wild bee species, both social and solitary, and that maintenance of these pollinators is directly related to practices adopted in rural areas, whether within crop fields or in forest remnants used as nesting sites by wild bees. © 2018 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

Foraging in endothermic insects is energy-intensive and the question arises how much energy bees invest in a resource without any metabolically usable energy. We investigated the energy demand of water collecting bees under natural conditions. The thermoregulation and energetic effort was measured simultaneously in a broad range of experimental ambient temperatures (Ta = 12–40 °C). The thorax temperature as well as the energetic turnover showed a great variability. The mean Tthorax was ranging from ~ 35.7 °C at 12 °C to nearly 42.5 °C at 40 °C. The energy turnover calculated from CO2-release was highest at a Ta of 20 °C with about 60 mW and lowest at 40 °C with about 22 mW per bee. The total costs during collection decreased from 10.4 J at 12 °C to 0.5 J at 40 °C. The energetic effort of the water collectors was comparable with that of 0.5 M sucrose foraging bees. Our investigation strongly supports the hypothesis that the bees’ motivational status determines the energetic performance during foraging. © 2018, The Author(s).",Article,Scopus

Bees are an essential pollinator group for forest plant populations and food production in tropical landscapes. They are also dependent on forested environments which are essential to maintaining their diversity and pollination services. We analysed bee diversity in forest patches and adjacent open areas to evaluate if bees can use complementary environments in heterogeneous altered tropical landscapes. The effect of landscape level heterogeneity and forest amount on bee diversity was also assessed. Our hypothesis was that bee communities will be richer and more diverse in highly forested and heterogeneous landscapes when compared to areas dominated by few human-made environments, but due to supplementary foraging behaviors, they will be more abundant in open areas where flower availability is higher. We actively sampled bees visiting flowers within forest patches and in surrounding open areas between the Cantareira and Mantiqueira mountain ranges in São Paulo, Brazil. We found both higher bee richness and diversity in open areas than in forest patches, partially denying our initial hypothesis but supporting that bees are more abundant in open areas. We found strong indication that landscapes with a higher amount of forest and environmental heterogeneity can provide more resources for bees through resource complementation processes, maintaining their diversity in the landscape. The presence of forest patches close to crop and open areas is of utmost importance for the conservation of bees and pollination services with important consequences for land management in tropical environments. © 2018 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

We tested whether changes in the density of neighborhood conspecific and heterospecific plants and in the availability of resources influence the frequency and composition of floral and frugivorous visitors of eleven individuals of the same population of the threatened palm Euterpe edulis in Brazil. The frequency of floral visitors was positively associated with conspecific density and availability of resources. Species composition was affected by the availability of resources since some bee species were associated with palms that offered more flowers, whereas others were associated with palms that offered less. Two bee species may be able to mediate long-distance pollen-flow for E. edulis: an undetermined species of Euglossini and Apis mellifera. Frugivorous birds were not influenced by any of the factors investigated. Birds of the genus Turdus predominated in the assemblage and were responsible for most of the interactions. This is probably due to the fact that, unlike larger birds, species of Turdus are considered resilient to environmental disturbances. Due to the continuous defaunation and fragmentation of the Atlantic Forest, the number of large birds that can promote long-distance seed dispersal is declining, with implications for the genetic diversity of E. edulis. Measures to restore the population density of E. edulis will likely favor the recovery of its genetic diversity due to its high capacity for distant pollen dispersal. Recovering and protecting large frugivorous birds may also contribute to the maintenance of the population density and genetic diversity of E. edulis. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",Article,Scopus

Earlier studies have alluded to pollination by deception in members of the Myristica genus, and thus we examined the pollination ecology comprising floral biology, flower production, flower visitors, and reproductive success in M. fatua and inferred the potential strategies that could permit such deception in this habitat specialist tree. Male flowers provide pollen rewards for an extended period of time while female flowers are rewardless and both sexes are visited by generalist insects, mainly by honeybees and stingless bees. Bee visits were significantly more frequent and longer on male than on female flowers as bees collected pollen from male flowers. We found that flower production patterns create a preponderance of males compared to females in the swamp populations. Using a model of honeybee color vision, we found the distance between the color loci of male and female flowers and based on minimum visual angle subtended by these flowers, we suggest that the two floral sexes cannot be discriminated by bees. Bees are likely deceived by the perceptual similarity of rewardless female flowers to pollen-offering male flowers and pollination is the consequence of foraging errors made by pollinators that encounter largely male–rarely female flower mosaics as they forage among clump-distributed M. fatua trees in the swamp habitat. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Article,Scopus

Here, we describe an experimental study to determine the fitness consequences of phenological shifts in blue orchard bee (Osmia lignaria) emergence, compare the measured seasonal fitness landscape with observed phenology in the unmanipulated population, and assess seasonal variation in key factors related to reproduction, foraging, and brood parasitism that were expected to affect the shape of the fitness landscape. By tracking individually marked females, we were able to estimate the lifetime fitness impacts of phenological advances and delays. We also measured parasitism risk, floral resource use, and nesting behavior to understand how each varies seasonally, and their combined effects on realized fitness. Survival to nesting decreased non-monotonically throughout the season, with a 20.4% decline in survival rates between the first and second cohorts. The total reproductive output per maternal bee was 14.9% higher in the second cohort compared to the first, and 161% higher in the second cohort compared to the third. Combining seasonal patterns in survival and reproductive output, experimentally advanced females showed 30.6% higher fitness than bees released at the historic peak. In contrast, the nesting phenology of unmanipulated bees showed nearly equal numbers of nesting attempts in the first two cohorts. Both increased resource availability and reduced parasitism risk favored earlier emergence. These results are consistent with a population experiencing directional selection for earlier emergence, adaptive bet-hedging, or developmental constraints.

However, city planners often lack knowledge to identify how well different parts of the green infrastructure are connected, and tools to estimate the accessibility to important habitats for different species in urban areas are strongly needed. We compared the ability of three measures of available food resources, with increasing complexity, for explaining species richness and abundance of bees and wasps at 23 locations in an urban landscape in Sweden. Specifically, we tested (1) the summed amount of food habitat within a buffer circle, (2) the amount of food habitat weighted by distance, and (3) the summed amount of food habitat within an area created by cost-weighted distance based on the surrounding landscape friction. We tested two spatial scales (200 and 400 m). The results show that both the summed (1) and the weighted measures (2) were very poor in explaining species richness and abundance regardless of spatial scale, while we found significant relationships for both species richness and abundance with the friction-based measure (3) at both scales. For the friction-based measure, the relationships with both response variables were strongest at the smallest spatial scale (200 m). We conclude that bees and wasps are sensitive to barriers such as large roads and built-up areas when foraging in urban environments. This is important to consider when assessing the functionality of urban green infrastructure in order to not overestimate the available amount of habitat and how well different parts of the landscape are connected for these important pollinators. © 2018 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

Conversely, introduced biotically pollinated plants might facilitate improved pollinator services to native plants by supporting higher pollinator densities and extending the flowering season. We examined weekly pollinator visitation to native and introduced plants, at five elevations over two flowering seasons on The Remarkables range, south-central South Island, New Zealand. In this area, introduced plants dominate the vegetation at lower elevations but are restricted to disturbed areas above treeline. We tested whether pollinator visitation rates and quantities of introduced pollen on insects or transferred to native flowers differed with elevation and community context, or with the local abundance of introduced flowers regardless of elevation. Introduced biotically pollinated plants produced more flowers and flowered later than most native species and were extensively utilised by native solitary bees. Weekly visitation rates to native flowers were higher in the first half of the flowering season than the second half, and were positively correlated with visitation rates to co-occurring introduced flowers. Introduced flower abundance did not affect visitation to native flowers but did significantly predict the occurrence of introduced pollen on native insects and stigmas of native flowers. Pollen contamination was also higher in the latter part of the flowering season. While an increase in introduced flowers at high elevations may benefit native pollinators by increasing the quantity and duration of floral resources available, the heavy use of introduced flowers by native bees will lead to at least localised stigma contamination, particularly for late flowering species. However, more information is required on foraging ranges of native pollinators and pollen limitation in native species to understand the consequences of introduced species expansion into alpine areas. © 2018, Swiss Botanical Society.",Article,Scopus

Though we have some understanding of where and when they travel, we still have very little insight into who migrates with whom and for how long. Group formation is pivotal in allowing individuals to interact, transfer information, and adapt to changing conditions [2]. Yet it is remarkably difficult to infer group membership in migrating animals without being able to directly observe them. Here, we use novel lightweight atmospheric pressure loggers to monitor group dynamics in a small migratory bird, the European bee-eater (Merops apiaster). We present the first evidence of a migratory bird flying together with non-kin of different ages and sexes at all stages of the life cycle. In fact, 49% stay together throughout the annual cycle, never separating longer than 5 days at a time despite the ∼14,000-km journey. Of those that separated for longer, 89% reunited within less than a month with individuals they had previously spent time with, having flown up to 5,000 km apart. These birds were not only using the same non-breeding sites, but also displayed coordinated foraging behaviors—these are unlikely to result from chance encounters in response to the same environmental conditions alone. Better understanding of migratory group dynamics, using the presented methods, could help improve our understanding of collective decision making during large-scale movements. Dhanjal-Adams et al. report on the spatiotemporal group dynamics of migrating bee-eaters using novel lightweight (1.4 g) multisensor loggers. Using synchronisation in pressure measurements, they show how some birds migrate ∼14,000 km together, while others repeatedly separate and come back together, despite separations of days or weeks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

Species as diverse as rats, bees, and crabs achieve this by integrating all changes of direction with the distance covered during their foraging trips, a process called path integration. They generate an estimate of their current position relative to a starting point, enabling a straight-line return, following what is known as a home vector. While in theory path integration always leads the animal precisely back home, in the real world noise limits the usefulness of this strategy when operating in isolation. Noise results from stochastic processes in the nervous system and from unreliable sensory information, particularly when obtaining heading estimates. Path integration, during which angular self-motion provides the sole input for encoding heading (idiothetic path integration), results in accumulating errors that render this strategy useless over long distances. In contrast, when using an external compass this limitation is avoided (allothetic path integration). Many navigating insects indeed rely on external compass cues for estimating body orientation, whereas they obtain distance information by integration of steps or optic-flow-based speed signals. In the insect brain, a region called the central complex plays a key role for path integration. Not only does the central complex house a ring-attractor network that encodes head directions, neurons responding to optic flow also converge with this circuit. A neural substrate for integrating direction and distance into a memorized home vector has therefore been proposed in the central complex. We discuss how behavioral data and the theoretical framework of path integration can be aligned with these neural data. Heinze, Narendra and Cheung discuss the fundamental principles of insect path integration behavior and highlight interactions with other navigational strategies using insights from behavioral data, the theoretical underpinnings, and from recent discoveries illuminating the neural control of path integration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Review,Scopus

In decentralized systems in which individuals use local cues to decide how to allocate their time amongst multiple tasks, a ""global"" signal detectable over large distances by all members of the group could have a profound effect on task allocation and coordination. Honeybees provide a unique opportunity to study how information transfer modulates behavior because they produce pheromones that can regulate the actions of thousands of individuals in a colony. We used electrophysiological and behavioral assays to compare the transmission modes of 2 larval pheromones to test the hypothesis that larval pheromones can act as ""global"" signals by rapidly regulating behavior throughout a colony without direct physical interactions between individuals. By studying mechanisms of pheromone transmission at the individual and colony level, we provide evidence that larval pheromones act as direct rapid and powerful regulators of behavior, even among individuals too far away from each other to use visual or tactile cues.

Speed-accuracy tactics are known to vary consistently among individuals, and show a degree of flexibility during colour discrimination tasks in bees. Such individual flexibility in speed-accuracy tactics is likely to be advantageous for animals exposed to fluctuating environments, such as changes in predation threat. We therefore test whether individual speed-accuracy tactics are fixed or flexible under different levels of predation threat in a model invertebrate, the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. The flexibility of speed-accuracy tactics in a foraging context was tested in the laboratory using a ""meadow"" of artificial flowers harbouring ""robotic"" crab spider predators. We found that while the ranking of bees along the speed and accuracy continuums was consistent across two levels of predation threat, there was some flexibility in the tactics used by individual bees - most bees became less accurate at colour discrimination when exposed to predation threat when flower types were rewarding. The relationship between decision speed and accuracy was influenced by predator detectability and the risk associated with making incorrect choices during the colour discrimination task. Predator crypsis resulted in a breakdown in the relationship between speed and accuracy, especially when making an incorrect floral choice incurred a distasteful quinine punishment. No single speed-accuracy tactic was found to be optimal in terms of foraging efficiency under either predation threat situation. However, bees that made faster decisions achieved higher nectar collection rates in predator free situations, while accurate bees achieved higher foraging rates under predation threat. Our findings show that while individual bees remain relatively consistent in terms of whether they place greater emphasis on speed or accuracy under predation threat, they can respond flexibly to the additional time costs of detecting predators. © 2018 Wang, Chittka and Ings.",Article,Scopus

Field studies are needed to determine whether these effects also occur when bees forage on flowering crops grown from neonicotinoid-treated seeds. However, for many reasons the results of field experiments may be inconsistent. For example, neonicotinoid residues in crop nectar and pollen and the availability of alternative nectar and pollen sources vary. In addition to these practical difficulties, different field experiment designs, especially different controls, address different questions. Most field studies on neonicotinoids have compared the performance of colonies adjacent to a bee-attractive crop grown from treated seeds with control colonies adjacent to the same crop grown from untreated seeds. This makes it possible to determine the cost, C, of any insecticide residues but not the overall effect of the crop, B–C, which includes any benefits, B, of the additional pollen and nectar. An alternative and rarely used design, only 1 of the 12 field studies reviewed, determines the overall effect of the crop by siting control colonies out of foraging range of the crop but in the same landscape. This design may be more relevant because bee-attractive crops, such as oilseed rape, are normally grown as alternatives to arable crops that do not provide bee forage, such as wheat and barley. As a result, it is possible that B–C > 0 (or B–C = 0) even if C > 0. The challenges and merits of alternative experimental designs are discussed in relation to practical considerations and policy making. Determinación de los efectos de los insecticidas neonicotinoides en el rendimiento de las colonias de abejas en el campo: ¿qué prueban los diferentes diseños experimentales? Estudios de laboratorio han demostrado que los insecticidas neonicotinoides pueden causar efectos subletales en las abejas. Se necesitan estudios de campo para determinar si estos efectos también se producen cuando las abejas se alimentan de los cultivos en flor que crecen a partir de semillas tratadas con neonicotinoides. Sin embargo, por muchas razones los resultados de los experimentos de campo pueden ser inconsistentes. Por ejemplo, los residuos de neonicotinoides en el néctar y el polen de los cultivos y la disponibilidad de fuentes alternativas de néctar y polen varían. Además de estas dificultades prácticas, diferentes diseños de experimentos de campo, especialmente diferentes controles, abordan diferentes cuestiones. La mayoría de los estudios de campo sobre los neonicotinoides han comparado el rendimiento de las colonias adyacentes a un cultivo atractivo para las abejas cultivado a partir de semillas tratadas con colonias de control adyacentes al mismo cultivo cultivado a partir de semillas no tratadas. Esto permite determinar el coste, C, de cualquier residuo de insecticida, pero no el efecto global del cultivo, B–C, que incluye cualquier beneficio, B, del polen y néctar adicionales. Un diseño alternativo y raramente utilizado, sólo en 1 de los 12 estudios de campo revisados, determina el efecto general del cultivo al situar las colonias de control fuera del rango de alimentación del cultivo pero en el mismo paisaje. Este diseño puede ser más relevante porque los cultivos atractivos para las abejas, como la colza, se cultivan normalmente como alternativas a los cultivos herbáceos que no proporcionan forraje a las abejas, como el trigo y la cebada. Como resultado, es posible que B−C > 0 (o B−C = 0) incluso si C > 0. Los desafíos y los méritos de los diseños experimentales alternativos se discuten en relación con las consideraciones prácticas y la formulación de políticas. © 2018, © 2018 International Bee Research Association.",Review,Scopus

Since the pattern of reorientation flights has not yet been studied, we asked whether this form of exploratory behavior differs from the well described exploratory orientation flights performed by young honeybees before they start foraging. We also investigated whether the exploratory components of re-orientation flights differ from foraging flights and if so how. We recorded reorientation flights using harmonic radar technology and compared the patterns and flight parameters of these flights with the first exploratory orientation flights of young honeybees and foraging flights of experienced foragers. Just as exploratory orientation flights of young honeybees, re-orientation flights can be classified into short- and long-range flights, and most short-range re-orientation flights were performed under unfavorable weather conditions. This indicates that bees adapt the flight pattern of their re-orientation and orientation flights to changing weather conditions in a similar way. Unlike exploratory orientation flights, more than one sector of the landscape was explored during a long-range re-orientation flight, and significantly longer flight durations and flight distances were observed. Thus, re-orienting bees explored a larger terrain than bees performing their first exploratory orientation flight. By displacing some bees after their first re-orientation flight, we could demonstrate that a single re-orientation flight seems to be sufficient to learn the new location of the hive. The flight patterns of re-orientation flights differed clearly from those of foraging flights. Thus, re-orientation flights represent a special exploratory behavior that is triggered by a change in the location of the hive. © 2018 Degen et al.

Ceratina australensis is found throughout eastern Australia in dead, broken stems of weedy plant species, where it makes its nests. Here we developed eight microsatellite loci and used these markers to characterize the genetic structure of three populations across three distinct ecoregions that are connected by the Murray- Darling River basin. We genotyped 57 female bees and found significant and geographically consistent variation in allelic diversity and heterozygosity between populations. Through comparisons with the results of mitochondrial DNA screening from a previous study, we infer the possibilities of male-biased dispersal and limited interpopulation migration. Based on available distribution data, the expansion of C. australensis into arid regions appears to follow the Murray-Darling River basin and associated waterways. This basin has undergone severe anthropogenic disturbance since European settlement of Australia, with large-scale changes to native vegetation communities. Although it is unknown how these changes have affected local insect communities, C. australensis does not rely on a single plant species for nesting habitat. We provide evidence for the hypothesis that expansion of C. australensis into Australia might have been aided by the introduction of non-native pithy stemmed plants. © 2018 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.",Article,Scopus

Although cold-narcosis is widely regarded as non-invasive and non-damaging for neural structures, it has been shown that it can influence the bees’ subsequent behaviour in various ways. While we do have some understanding of the effect of cold treatment on handling stress, memory, locomotion and foraging in bees, it remains to be tested whether their defensive behaviour is affected. We investigated the response of foragers to a leg pinch applied before, during or after cold-anaesthesia. As expected, bees pinched at the hive entrance all responded defensively, while anaesthetised bees showed no response. When the pinch was applied after the bees recovered from cold-narcosis, all individuals were defensive, suggesting that previous cooling had not impaired nociception. We then subjected two groups of bees to a continuous pinch, commencing either before or during cold anaesthesia. Interestingly, most of these bees did not show defensive behaviour once awake, even though the clip was still attached to their leg. Chilling only lead to a diminished defensive response if the nociceptive stimulus was continuous rather than momentary, which suggests that it is not the chilling on its own, but the duration of the pinch in combination with cold narcosis that is critical. Our findings highlight the subtle ways in which treatment of insects during narcosis can affect their subsequent behaviour, and point to new ways in which narcosis can interact with sensory perception and adaptation. © 2018, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).",Article,Scopus

Across Europe, wildflower seed mixtures are widely sown on farmland to encourage pollinators, but the extent to which key pollinator groups such as solitary bees exploit and benefit from these resources is unclear. We used high-throughput sequencing of 164 pollen samples extracted from the brood cells of six common cavity-nesting solitary bee species (Osmia bicornis, Osmia caerulescens, Megachile versicolor, Megachile ligniseca, Megachile centuncularis and Hylaeus confusus) which are widely distributed across the UK and Europe. We documented their pollen use across 19 farms in southern England, UK, revealing their forage plants and examining the structure of their pollen transport networks. Of the 32 plant species included currently in sown wildflower mixes, 15 were recorded as present within close foraging range of the bees on the study farms, but only Ranunculus acris L. was identified within the pollen samples. Rosa canina L. was the most commonly found of the 23 plant species identified in the pollen samples, suggesting that, in addition to providing a nesting resource for Megachile leafcutter bees, it may be an important forage plant for these species. Higher levels of connectance and nestedness were characteristic of pollen transport networks on farms with abundant floral resources, which may increase resilience to species loss. Our data suggest that plant species promoted currently by agri-environment schemes are not optimal for solitary bee foraging. If a diverse community of pollinators is to be supported on UK and European farmland, additional species such as R. canina should be encouraged to meet the foraging requirements of solitary bees. © 2018 The Authors.

In vespids, which are mostly predators, the foraging range of workers determines their maximum predation pressure round the nest. One of these species, Vespa velutina, a recently invasive species introduced into Europe, exerts a strong predation on honeybees at the hive. Therefore, the definition of its activity rhythm and spatial range of predation is of primary importance. Using radio frequency identification tags (RFID), two experiments were carried out to (a) determine their return ability (called homing) in releasing 318 individuals at different distance from their colony and (b) monitor their foraging activity rhythm and the duration of their flights based on 71 individuals followed 24 hr/24 during 2 months. The homing ability of V. velutina was evaluated to be up to 5,000 m and was not affected by the cardinal orientation of release point. The lag time to return to the nest increased with the distance of release. Most of the flight activity took place between 07:00 a.m. and 08:00 p.m., hornets doing principally short flights of less than an hour. Foraging range was thus estimated ca. 1,000 m around the nest. This study of V. velutina assisted by RFID tags provides for the first time a baseline for its potential foraging distance that increase our knowledge of this species to (a) refine more accurately models for risk assessment and (b) define security perimeter for early detection of predation on invasion front. © 2018 The Authors.

In this study, we have used standard three-band digital cameras to develop and assess a simple parallelpiped algorithm to detect the flowers of the Corymbia calophylla tree in Western Australia, the largest source of honey in the state. The algorithm has been tested in a number of situations and, within the bounds of the study, works to a better than 90% classification accuracy for Digital Single Lens Reflex camera images of trees within 15 m distance, and often better than 95%. To determine how this approach could be used by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle platforms to detect flowering Corymbia calophylla flowering, image resolution was progressively degraded until flowers could not be detected. It was found that the cluster size of flowers (i.e. whether flowers occur individually or in groups) played an important role in determining the accuracy of flower detection, but overall a minimum resolution of 10 pixels per flower is required for reliable detection of flower pixels. While there is some improvement above this resolution, the effect is minimal. The key to accurate measurement of percentage flower cover is the accuracy of the classification of the background. If the background classification error is known for an image or scene, the percentage flower cover can be calculated with as little as 2% flower cover. Based on this study, UAV platforms with standard RGB cameras appear to be suitable for detection of Corymbia calophylla flowers if surveys are designed within the bounds described. Thus, UAV surveys may prove to be useful for beekeepers to optimise the location of their beehives amongst a choice of different locations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

However, land use changes have contributed to the decline of pollinators and their habitats. In agricultural landscapes that also support renewable energy developments such as utility-scale solar energy [USSE] facilities, opportunities may exist to conserve insect pollinators and locally restore their ecosystem services through the implementation of vegetation management approaches that aim to provide and maintain pollinator habitat at USSE facilities. As a first step toward understanding the potential agricultural benefits of solar-pollinator habitat, we identified areas of overlap between USSE facilities and surrounding pollinator-dependent crop types in the United States (U.S.). Using spatial data on solar energy developments and crop types across the U.S., and assuming a pollinator foraging distance of 1.5 km, we identified over 3,500 km2 of agricultural land near existing and planned USSE facilities that may benefit from increased pollination services through the creation of pollinator habitat at the USSE facilities. The following five pollinator-dependent crop types accounted for over 90% of the agriculture near USSE facilities, and these could benefit most from the creation of pollinator habitat at existing and planned USSE facilities: soybeans, alfalfa, cotton, almonds, and citrus.

Bombus vosnesenskii, which occurs across a broader elevational range at most latitudes, exhibits little population structure while B. bifarius, which occupies a relatively narrow higher elevation niche across most latitudes, exhibits much stronger population differentiation, although gene flow in both species is best explained by isolation with environmental niche resistance.

Microsatellite-based parentage analysis provides accurate estimates of contemporary gene dispersal. Although most tropical trees have been shown to exhibit widespread pollen dispersal, few studies have estimated contemporary gene dispersal after seedling establishment. Bertholletia excelsa (Lecythidaceae) is pollinated by large-bodied bees, while previous seed-tracking experiments suggest their seeds are mainly dispersed across very short distances by scatter-hoarding rodents, who primarily act as seed predators. Here we used parentage analysis to provide contemporary estimates of pollen and seed dispersal in B. excelsa recruits. We examined six 25-ha plots located in two natural stands in the Acre River valley, in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. We used 11 microsatellite markers to estimate genetic diversity and fixation index parameters in adults, seedlings and saplings. Genetic diversity was moderate and did not differ across size classes or sampling locations. We assigned pollen and seed parents for < 20% of the recruits, indicating that most events of realized gene flow occurred beyond our 25-ha plots. Only 10 parentage assignments were confirmed with 80% confidence. Pollen distance ranged from 33 to 372 m and seed dispersal from 58 to 655 m. Actual seed-dispersal distances were far greater than the estimates obtained in previous seed-tracking experiments.

Targeting neuronal receptors, they have deleterious effects on the behaviour and physiology of many insects. Bees are exposed to these insecticides in pollen and nectar while providing pollination services to agricultural crops, and neonicotinoids have been shown to impair navigation and decrease their foraging activity. We have previously reported the effect of dietary thiamethoxam on sucrose responsiveness of young worker bees. Here, we exposed caged foragers to sublethal acute doses of clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, then tested them individually for sucrose responsiveness using standard methods. In addition, we tested the response to a range of sucrose solutions laced with neonicotinoids on bees previously unexposed to neonicotinoids. This paradigm mimics the situation where foragers would first encounter poisoned nectars varying in sugar concentration. Bees were exposed to the insecticides in the feeding solution for 24 h before testing, or in the test solutions, or both. The three compounds had a detrimental effect on responses to mid-to-high sucrose concentrations under all experimental conditions, and unexposed bees tested with laced sucrose displayed unexpected low responses to the higher sucrose concentrations tested. This attenuation of sucrose response is further evidence that neonicotinoids are multisensory disruptors, with potent actions against pollinators and other beneficial insects at first contact. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

The demand for nectar and pollen varies during the year, with more pollen needed in spring for colony population growth and more nectar needed in summer to sustain the maximum colony size and collect surplus nectar stores for winter. Sufficient bee forage is therefore necessary to ensure a healthy bee colony. Land-use changes can reduce the availability of floral resources suitable for bees, thereby increasing the susceptibility of bees to other stressors such as disease and pesticides. In contrast, land-based management decisions to protect or plant bee forage can enhance pollen and nectar supply to bees while meeting other goals such as riparian planting for water-quality improvement. Commercial demand for honey can also put pressure on floral resources through over-crowding of hives. To help understand and manage floral resources for bees, we developed a spatial model for mapping monthly nectar and pollen production from maps of land cover. Based on monthly estimated production data we mapped potential monthly supply of nectar and pollen to a given apiary location in the landscape. This is done by summing the total production within the foraging range of the apiary while subtracting the estimated nectar converted to energy for collection. Ratios of estimated supply over theoretical hive demand may then be used to infer a potential landscape carrying capacity to sustain hives. This model framework is quantitative and spatial, utilizing estimated flight energy costs for nectar foraging. It can contribute to management decisions such as where apiaries could be placed in the landscape depending on floral resources and where nectar limited areas may be located. It can contribute to planning areas for bee protection or planting such as in riparian vegetation. This would aid managed bee health, wild pollinator protection, and honey production. We demonstrate the methods in a case study in New Zealand where there is a growing demand for mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey production. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America",Article,Scopus

Even though the basic ABC algorithm used in mobile robot can obtain a quick absolute trajectory, it still has its own drawbacks. This bio-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm, which emulates the bee's behavior of foraging around their bee-hives, is used to obtain the optimal trajectory from a source position to a destination position. The trajectories of the robots' motion from predetermined source points to target points in the prescribed scenarios are evaluated with the eventual motive to acquire collision-free trajectories and to reduce the trajectory lengths of all the motion of robots in the scenario. The trajectories that are to be developed locally for 'n' robots are adequately small with minimal spacing with the obstacles, if any, in the prescribed scenario. Based on the traditional Artificial Bee Colony algorithm, another objective function for each and every robot's trajectory is inferred for global trajectory planning. The fitness function and initialization strategy are also optimized to enhance the capabilities of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results of the proposed Enhanced ABC algorithm are compared with the basic ABC algorithm. It reveals that the proposed optimization algorithm performs better than the basic ABC algorithm in terms of trajectory distance and path deviations and also shows that the proposed algorithm is effective for use in real-time trajectory planning of mobile robots. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

However, we do not yet know the extent to which bee habitat in the form of urban gardens might contribute to pollination services in surrounding crops. We explored whether gardens might provision pollinators to adjacent agricultural areas by sampling bees from gardens in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area, and estimating typical foraging distances in the context of commercialand residential-scale pollination-dependent crops up to 1000 m from garden study sites. We estimate that garden bees could forage outside of the garden in which they were collected, and that when pollination-dependent crops (commercial-scale or residential-scale) are nearby, 30-50% of the garden bee community could potentially provide pollination services to adjacent crops, if urban bees readily cross boundaries and forage among habitat types. Urban gardens might thus be well-positioned to provision neighboring farms and food gardens with pollination services, or could serve as a refuge for pollinators when forage is scarce or crop management practices are inhospitable. The actual capacity of gardens to serve as a refuge for pollinators from agricultural fields depends upon the extent to which bees forage across habitat types. However, relatively little is known about the degree to which bees move among habitat patches in heterogeneous landscapes. We thus propose a research agenda that can document the extent to which gardens contribute to pollinator health and pollination services at the interface of urban, peri-urban, and rural landscapes. In particular, more data is needed on how landscape context impedes or promotes garden bee movement between habitat types. © 2018 by the authors.",Article,Scopus

To evaluate the potential of the various insects visiting hybrid carrot flowers to facilitate pollen transfer, this study examines insect visitation rates to hybrid carrot seed crops in relation to weather, time of day and season, pollen carrying capacity, inter-row movement, and visitation frequency to male-fertile and male-sterile umbels. The highest pollen loads were carried by nectar scarabs, honey bees, and the hover fly Eristalis tenax (Linnaeus). Honey bees and muscoid flies were observed to forage mostly within the male fertile carrot row while nectar scarabs and E. tenax foraged across rows, carrying equal pollen loads regardless of their distance from the pollen source. All observed insect taxa were more frequently seen visiting male-fertile than male-sterile umbels. In contrast to other visiting insects, honey bees were abundant and frequent visitors and were observed carrying high pollen loads. Consequently, we suggest both optimizing honey bee management and improving the attraction of carrot lines to honey bees to improve pollination rates for hybrid carrot seed crops. © 2018 by the authors.

Only a subset of potential pollinators, mainly large bees, learn to successfully forage on such flowers. Thus, complexity may comprise a morphological filter that restricts the range of visitors and thereby increases food intake for successful foragers. Such pollinator specialization, in turn, promotes flower constancy and reduces cross-species pollen transfer, providing fitness benefits to plants with complex flowers. Since visual signals associated with floral morphological complexity are generally honest (i.e., indicate food rewards), pollinators need to perceive and process them. Physiological studies show that bees detect distant flowers through long-wavelength sensitive photoreceptors. Bees effectively perceive complex shapes and learn the positions of contours based on their spatial frequencies. Complex flowers require long handling times by naive visitors, and become highly profitable only for experienced foragers. To explore possible pathways towards the evolution of floral complexity, we discuss cognitive mechanisms that potentially allow insects to persist on complex flowers despite low initial foraging gains, suggest experiments to test these mechanisms, and speculate on their adaptive value. © 2018 by the authors.

Such movements may lead to pathogen spill-over with consequences on the honey bee health and finally on population decline. Ascosphaera apis is the causative agent of the chalkbrood disease, a pathology affecting honey bee larvae that significantly harms population growth and colony productivity. In this study, we detected the presence of A. apis in adult worker honey bees by PCR-amplification of the intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS1) of the ribosomal gene (rDNA). We first optimized the DNA extraction by testing different protocols in individual and pooled (colony level) adult honey bee samples. Subsequently, the presence of the fungus A. apis was assessed in both stationary and migratory colonies (subjected to small scale regional level movements) to determine the effect of migratory practices on the dispersal of this pathogen. Results confirmed a higher prevalence of A. apis in migratory apiaries when compared to stationary ones, indicating that migratory colonies are more likely to develop chalkbrood disease. Given these results, we suggest that beekeepers should be aware of the risks of pathogens spreading while moving beehives, even within a reduced geographic range. © 2018 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

The popularity of stingless beekeeping has resulted in large-scale anthropogenic movements of nests, sometimes from outside their native range. Colony movement has the potential to impact local populations via transfer of parasites and pathogens and gene flow across unnaturally large geographic scales. Tetragonula carbonaria is the most widespread and commonly kept stingless bee species in Australia. Concerns have been raised that large-scale artificial propagation of T. carbonaria colonies by Sydney beekeepers, from a small number of colonies that originated in south-east Queensland, may have two consequences. First, the managed population may be becoming increasingly inbred. Second, the wild population may be experiencing significant introgression of south-east Queensland genotypes, potentially diluting local adaptations to the Sydney environment and resulting in the loss of local alleles. Here we show, based on microsatellite and mitochondrial markers, that both the managed and wild Sydney populations are significantly different from the south-east Queensland population. Nonetheless there is evidence that introgression of south-east Queensland alleles is impacting the genetic structure of both wild and managed Sydney populations. The two Sydney populations are indistinguishable, suggesting two-way gene flow in Sydney consistent with expectations of gene flow via male dispersal. All populations have low inbreeding coefficients, suggesting that they are genetically healthy. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Article,Scopus

We sought to predict the overall impact of climate change on venomous terrestrial species. We hypothesize that given the close relationship between terrestrial venomous species and climate, a changing global environment may result in increased species migration, geographical redistribution, and longer seasons for envenomation, which would have repercussions on human health. Methods: A retrospective analysis of environmental, ecological, and medical literature was performed with a focus on climate change, toxinology, and future modeling specific to venomous terrestrial creatures. Species included venomous reptiles, snakes, arthropods, spiders, and Hymenoptera (ants and bees). Animals that are vectors of hemorrhagic infectious disease (eg, mosquitos, ticks) were excluded. Results: Our review of the literature indicates that changes to climatic norms will have a potentially dramatic effect on terrestrial venomous creatures. Empirical evidence demonstrates that geographic distributions of many species have already shifted due to changing climatic conditions. Given that most terrestrial venomous species are ectotherms closely tied to ambient temperature, and that climate change is shifting temperature zones away from the equator, further significant distribution and population changes should be anticipated. For those species able to migrate to match the changing temperatures, new geographical locations may open. For those species with limited distribution capabilities, the rate of climate change may accelerate faster than species can adapt, causing population declines. Specifically, poisonous snakes and spiders will likely maintain their population numbers but will shift their geographic distribution to traditionally temperate zones more often inhabited by humans. Fire ants and Africanized honey bees are expected to have an expanded range distribution due to predicted warming trends. Human encounters with these types of creatures are likely to increase, resulting in potential human morbidity and mortality. Conclusions: Temperature extremes and changes to climatic norms may have a dramatic effect on venomous terrestrial species. As climate change affects the distribution, populations, and life histories of these organisms, the chance of encounters could be altered, thus affecting human health and the survivability of these creatures. © 2017 Wilderness Medical Society",Article,Scopus

However, in many cases, the environmental drivers are poorly understood. To identify and rank the drivers currently causing broad-scale floristic changes in N Europe, we analysed data from two vascular plant surveys of 200 randomly selected 2.5 × 2.5 km grid-squares in Scania, southernmost Sweden, conducted 1989–2006 and 2008–2015, respectively, and related the change in frequency (performance) of the species to a wide range of species-specific plant traits. We chose traits representing all plausible drivers of recent floristic changes: climatic change (northern distribution limit, flowering time), land-use change (light requirement, response to grazing/mowing, response to soil disturbance), drainage (water requirement), acidification (pH optimum), nitrogen deposition and eutrophication (N requirement, N fixation ability, carnivory, parasitism, mycorrhizal associations), pollinator decline (mode of reproduction) and changes in CO2 levels (photosynthetic pathway). Our results suggest that climate warming and changes in land-use were the main drivers of changes in the flora during the last decades. Climate warming appeared as the most influential driver, with northern distribution limit explaining 30%–60% of the variance in the GLMM models. However, the relative importance of the drivers differed among habitat types, with grassland species being affected the most by cessation of grazing/mowing and species of ruderal habitats by on-going concentration of both agriculture and human population to the most productive soils. For wetland species, only pH optimum was significantly related to species performance, possibly an effect of the increasing humification of acidic water bodies. An observed relative decline of mycorrhizal species may possibly be explained by decreasing nitrogen deposition resulting in less competition for phosphorus. We found no effect of shortage or decline of pollinating lepidopterans and bees. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus

Further insight into the temporal relationships of pollinators and their flowering partners is required to inform conservation efforts. Here we examined the phenology of British: (i) pollinator activity; (ii) insect-pollinated plant flowering; and (iii) extinct and endangered pollinator and plant species. Over 1 million records were collated from the historical databases of three British insect monitoring organisations, a global biodiversity database and an authoritative text covering the national flora. Almost two-thirds (62%) of pollinator species have peak flight observations during late-summer (July and August). This was the case across three of the groups studied: aculeate wasps (71% of species), bees (60%), and butterflies (72%), the exception being hoverflies (49%). When species geographical range (a proxy for abundance) was accounted for, a clear late-summer peak was clear across all groups. By contrast, there is marked temporal partitioning in the flowering of the major plant groups: insect-pollinated tree species blossoming predominantly during May (74%), shrubs in June (69%), and herbs in July (83%). There was a positive correlation between the number of pollinator species on the wing and the richness of both flowering insect-pollinated herbs and trees/shrubs species, per calendar month. In addition, significantly greater extinctions occurred in late-summer-flying pollinator species than expected (83% of extinct species vs. 62% of all species). This trend was driven primarily by bee extinctions (80% vs. 60%) and was not apparent in other groups. We contend that this is principally due to declines in late-summer resource supplies, which are almost entirely provisioned by herbs, a consequence of historical land-use change. We hypothesize that the seasonality of interspecific competition and the blooming of trees and mass-flowering crops may have partially buffered spring-flying pollinators from the impacts of historical change. © 2018",Article,Scopus

Pollinators facilitate cross-pollination that in turn promotes genetic diversity, mediates plant speciation, and contributes to eco-system stability. However, the abundance, diversity and health of wild pollinators are threatened by human activities such as anthropogenic climate impacts, habitat destruction and environmental pollutants, and the impact of these human activities on ecosystems is likely to increase. Despite recognizing the importance of wild pollinators and the implementation of targeted conservation programs, the contemporary threats of wild insect pollinators remain poorly understood. For the giant honey bee (Apis dorsata), an important wild pollinator and honey producer in tropical rainforests and agricultural areas across Asia, here we describe nest characteristics, colony migration and pollination role and review threats to their conservation. We found that A. dorsata nests featured a single honeycomb hanging from the branches of large trees. The bees undertook long distance migrations to locate seasonally ephemeral forage sources but regularly returned to previous nesting sites. We identified several anthropogenic activities that posed significant threats to A. dorsata conservation: harvesting entire colonies, deforestation, pesticide and herbicide utilization, parastioids, mites, pathogens and climate change. Based on our study, we recommend several conservation initiatives to pro-mote wild A. dorsata populations, which include artificial domestication, developing ecological agriculture, establishing of ecological corridors, inspection and quarantine controls on domesticated colonies, and sustainable utilization of the floral resources used by A. dorsata. We hope that this review will stimulate future research on giant honey bees whilst playing a significant role in their conservation and sustainable utilization. © 2018, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In the present study, the floral composition and diversity, flowering spectrum and availability of food resources in natural and man-made habitats in four rural municipalities in Lublin Upland, SE Poland were evaluated. The connection between pollinator-friendly biotopes was also determined and some suggestions are made on creation/supplementation of bee pastures adapted to the arable land structure in eastern Poland (mean acreage 7.65 ha). RESULTS: Forage species richness (S) differed among vegetation types: the highest S value was found in field margins, while mixed forests represented the lowest species richness (mean ± standard deviation = 37.8 ± 9.5 vs 16.5 ± 2.3). In all habitats, the most abundant flowering was recorded in May. Then the blooming abundance decreased until a complete decline at the end of summer. The mean distance between pollinator-friendly biotopes is 2.4 ± 1.53 km, which is out of the flying range/foraging distance of most pollinators. CONCLUSION: Shortages of nectar and pollen resources in the agricultural landscape of SE Poland are evident. Therefore it is assumed that the landscape structure requires support in terms of food niches for pollinators and creation/supplementation of bee pastures is necessary, e.g. six to nine patches of 0.025–0.3 ha each within an area of 100 ha. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry",Article,Scopus

Semi-natural habitats and mass-flowering crops such as oilseed rape provide abundant floristic resources for bees. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influences of the spatial distribution of semi-natural habitats and oilseed rape fields on the abundance and the mean body size of a solitary bee in grasslands. We focused on a generalist mining bee, Andrena cineraria, that forages and reproduces during oilseed rape flowering. In 21 permanent grasslands of Eastern France, we captured 1 287 individuals (1 205 males and 82 females) and measured the body size of male individuals. The flower density in grasslands was quantified during bee captures (2016) and the landscape surrounding grasslands was characterized during two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). The influence of oilseed rape was tested through its distribution in the landscape during both the current year of bee sampling and the previous year. Bee abundance was positively influenced by the flower density in grasslands and by the area covered by oilseed rape around grasslands in the previous year. The mean body size of A. cineraria was explained by the interaction between flower density in the grassland and the distance to the nearest oilseed rape field in the current year: the flower density positively influenced the mean body size only in grasslands distant from oilseed rape. A. cineraria abundance and body size distribution were not affected by the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. The spatial distribution of oilseed rape fields (during both the current and the previous year) as well as the local density of grassland flowers drive both bee abundance and the mean value of an intraspecific trait (body size) in permanent grasslands. Space-time variations of bee abundance and mean body size in grasslands may have important ecological implications on plant pollination and on interspecific interactions between pollinators.

Similar to individual immune defenses, social immunity, that is antiparasite defenses mounted for the benefit of individuals other than the actor, is predicted to be altered in social groups. The eusocial honey bee (Apis mellifera) secretes glucose oxidase (GOX), an antiseptic enzyme, throughout its colony, thereby providing immune protection to other individuals in the hive. We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the effects of group density on social immunity, specifically GOX activity, body mass and feeding behavior in caged honey bees. Individual honeybees caged in a low group density displayed increased GOX activity relative to those kept at a high group density. In addition, we provided evidence for a trade-off between GOX activity and body mass: Individuals caged in the low group density had a lower body mass, despite consuming more food overall. Our results provide the first experimental evidence that group density affects a social immune response in a eusocial insect. Moreover, we showed that the previously reported trade-off between immunity and body mass extends to social immunity. GOX production appears to be costly for individuals, and potentially the colony, given that low body mass is correlated with small foraging ranges in bees. At high group densities, individuals can invest less in social immunity than at low densities, while presumably gaining shared protection from infection. Thus, there is evidence that trade-offs at the individual level (GOX vs. body mass) can affect colony-level fitness. © 2018 The Authors.

In doing so, hoverflies serve a vital role as alternative pollinators, and are suggested to be the most important pollinators after bees and bumblebees. Unless the flower hoverflies are feeding from is large, they do not readily share the space with other insects, but instead opt to leave if another insect approaches. We used high-speed videography followed by 3D reconstruction of flight trajectories to quantify how female Eristalis hoverflies respond to approaching bees, wasps and two different hoverfly species. We found that, in 94% of the interactions, the occupant female left the flower when approached by another insect. We found that compared with spontaneous take-offs, the occupant hoverfly’s escape response was performed at ∼3 times higher speed (spontaneous take-off at 0.2±0.05 m s−1 compared with 0.55±0.08 m s−1 when approached by another Eristalis). The hoverflies tended to take off upward and forward, while taking the incomer’s approach angle into account. Intriguingly, we found that, when approached by wasps, the occupant Eristalis took off at a higher speed and when the wasp was further away. This suggests that feeding hoverflies may be able to distinguish these predators, demanding impressive visual capabilities. Our results, including quantification of the visual information available before occupant take-off, provide important insight into how freely behaving hoverflies perform escape responses from competitors and predators (e.g. wasps) in the wild. © 2018.

We explored the roles of land cover and land cover heterogeneity on bee nest distribution for the giant honeybee Apis dorsata, a key species for coffee pollination, in a complex agroforest landscape. We emphasized scaling and non-uniform effects by combining two different approaches of spatial analysis, the point-pattern analysis and surface-pattern analysis. We found non-exclusive, positive effects of agroforests, forest fragments and land-cover heterogeneity on the presence and number of nests. The distribution of nests responded to habitat heterogeneity at small scale (<100 m), forest fragments at medium scale (<300 m) and to agroforest at larger scales (500 m to 2 km). Our multiple approaches highlight that the landscape effects were neither linear nor uniform within the study zone. Nests were consistently located in areas of medium agroforest density or medium to high forest density, but were absent where forest fragments are the most concentrated. The agroforest matrix was particularly important in shaping the size of nest aggregates. Nests tended to be few when there is low tree cover at broad scale, while nests were numerous when agroforest patches are abundant within the bees’ foraging range. Synthesis and applications. Our study revealed that structurally complex landscapes appear to support bee populations. The spatial arrangement of different land covers affected honeybee nest distributions by providing nesting and foraging resources across multiple scales. The results suggest that continued intensification of small forest fragments and expansion of large monospecies plantations will be deleterious to the populations of giant honeybees A. dorsata. Fragmentation of the agroforestry matrix at small scales (100s m) does not, however, appear detrimental for A. dorsata as long as sufficient diversified resources are available at the landscape scale (kms). © 2017 The Authors.

The author, both experimenter and tear source, marked the minute bees while they drank from his eyes viewed in a mirror. All marked workers, 34 L. cacciae and 23 L. furva, came repeatedly to engorge, 34 and 27 times on average, respectively. The maximum number of times the same L. cacciae and L. furva came was 78 and 144 visits in one day, respectively; the maximum over two days was 145 visits by one L. cacciae; the maximum number of visiting days by the same bee was four over seven days by one L. furva which made 65 visits totally. The same forager may collect tears for more than 10 h in a day, on average for 3 h 15 min and 2 h 14 min for L. cacciae and L. furva, respectively. Engorging from the inner eye corner averaged 3.1 and 2.2 min, respectively, but only 1.3 and 0.9 min when settled on the lower eye lid/ciliae. The interval between consecutive visits averaged 3.3 min and 3.8 min, respectively. Lachryphagy occurred during all months of the year, with 91-320 foragers a day during the hot season and 6-280 foragers during the rainy season; tear collecting resumed after a downpour. During the cold season eye visitation was reduced to 3-64 foragers, but none left her nest when the temperature was below 22°C. Flying ranges were greater than in comparable non-lachryphagous meliponines. It is proposed that Lisotrigona colonies have workers that are, besides nectar and pollen foragers, specialized tear collectors. Tears are 200 times richer in proteins than sweat, a secretion well-known to be imbibed by many meliponines. Digestion of proteins dissolved in tears is not hampered by an exine wall as in pollen, and they have bactericidal properties. These data corroborate the inference that Lisotrigona, which also visit other mammals, birds and reptiles, harvest lachrymation mainly for its content of proteins rather than only for salt and water. © 2018 Siam Society.

Habitat loss and fragmentation potentially affect the performance of bees that forage nectar and pollen of plants in their habitats. In forest landscapes, silvicultural conifer plantations often have reduced and fragmented natural broadleaf forests, which seem to provide more floral resources for bees than do the plantations. 2. This study evaluated the effects of forest characteristics (i.e. elevation, area, edge length, and tree size of natural forests) on pollen diets (plant taxa assemblages of pollen grains in provisions) and total provision mass in oviposited chambers in nests made by a standardised number of Osmia cornifrons bees at 14 sites in a forestry area in central Japan. 3. From April to May, the numbers of nests and chambers per nest increased, and the provision mass per chamber decreased. Main pollen sources were Prunus at higher elevations in April and Wisteria at lower elevations in May, foraging on which increased the numbers of nests and chambers per nest. The provision mass per chamber was smaller at higher elevations in more fragmented natural forests. Decreases in the area of natural forests within the foraging range (400-m radii) of O. cornifrons increased the utilisation of Rubus pollen and decreased the total provision mass. 4. These findings suggest that the loss and fragmentation of natural broadleaf forests change pollen diets and reduce the provision mass of mason bees, which may reduce the number and size of their offspring. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society",Article,Scopus

Some algorithms, such as the use of pattern velocity in forward flight, are employed by all insects studied so far, and are used to control multiple flight tasks such as regulation of speed, measurement of distance, and positioning through narrow passages. Although much attention has been devoted to long-range navigation and homing in birds, until recently, very little was known about how birds control flight in a moment-to-moment fashion. A bird that flies rapidly through dense foliage to land on a branch-as birds often do-engages in a veritable three-dimensional slalom, in which it has to continually dodge branches and leaves, and find, and possibly even plan a collision-free path to the goal in real time. Each mode of flight from take-offto goal could potentially involve a different visual guidance algorithm.

The present article reports the results of laboratory studies (10-d adult and 22-d larval toxicity studies assessing the chronic toxicity of thiamethoxam to adult honey bees and larvae, respectively) and a colony feeding study, with 6 wk of exposure in an area with limited alternative forage, to provide a prewintering colony-level endpoint. The endpoints following exposure of individuals in the laboratory (10-d adult chronic no-observed-effect concentration [NOEC] for mortality 117 μg thiamethoxam/kg sucrose solution, 141 μg thiamethoxam/L sucrose solution; 22-d larval chronic NOEC 102 μg thiamethoxam/kg diet) are compared with those generated at the colony level, which incorporates sublethal effects (no-observed-adverse-effect concentration [NOAEC] 50 μg thiamethoxam/L sucrose solution, 43 μg thiamethoxam/kg sucrose solution). The data for sucrose-fed honey bee colonies support the lack of effects identified in previous colony-level field studies with thiamethoxam. However, unlike these field studies demonstrating no effects, colony feeding study data also provide a threshold level of exposure likely to result in adverse effects on the colony in the absence of alternative forage, and a basis by which to evaluate the potential risk of thiamethoxam residues detected in pollen, nectar, or water following treatment of bee-attractive crops.

Co-variance based optimization algorithms have faster convergence rate and remarkable efficiency as they possess fair information about the gradient of objective function. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is one of the highly researched and utilized optimization technique, based on the foraging behavior of honey bee swarms. In this article, we have proposed a novel ABC based algorithm for multiobjective optimization. The proposed Multi-objective Co-variance based ABC (M-CABC), is the first algorithm in its class which works on the coalition of statistical co-variance and ABC. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been gauged on both unconstrained and constrained multi-objective benchmark functions on the basis of error rate, generational distance and spacing metrics. The results have shown that M-CABC has eminently converged close to optimal pareto front while successfully maintaining high diversity in the solutions. The article concludes with the observatory remarks on the performance of M-CABC, which is consistent in solving low as well as high dimension multi-objective benchmark problems when it has been compared with other traditionally established multi-objective optimization algorithms. © 2018 Institute of Information Science.

For Mendacibombus bumblebees, high-elevation specialists with distributions centred on the QTP, we examine broader explanations. We extend integrative biogeography to cover multiple contributing factors by using a framework of sequential filters: 1) molecular evidence from four genes is used to estimate phylogenetic relationships, with time calibration from a published estimate; 2) spatial evidence from current distributions is combined with the phylogeny and constrained by a model of short-distance dispersal along mountain corridors to estimate ancestral distributions by both S-DIVA and S-DEC analysis; 3) geological evidence from the literature is used to constrain when high mountain ranges were uplifted to become potential corridors; and 4) climatological evidence from Mendacibombus niche-evolution reconstructions and from palaeoclimate simulations is used to constrain when habitat was suitable in key gaps within corridors. Explanations for Mendacibombus distributions can be identified that require only short-distance dispersal along mountain corridors, commensurate with the limited dispersal ability observed for bumblebees. These explanations depend on the timing of uplift of mountain ranges, regional climate change, and climate-niche evolution. The uplift of the QTP may have contributed to the initial Oligocene divergence of the common ancestor of Mendacibombus from other bumblebees, but for the first two thirds of the history of Mendacibombus, only a single lineage has present-day descendants. Divergence of multiple extant Mendacibombus lineages coincided with the Late Miocene–Pliocene uplift of externally connecting mountains, combined with regional climate cooling. These changes provided greater connectivity of suitable habitat, allowing these bumblebees to disperse out of the western QTP via new high bridges, escaping along the mountain corridors of the Tian Shan and Hindu Kush ranges, reaching eventually far to the west (Iberian Peninsula) and to the north-east (Kamchatka). © 2017 The Authors",Article,Scopus

High configurational landscape heterogeneity due to small fields and a high amount of field boundaries is hypothesized to enhance farmland biodiversity. Here, we investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming in large- vs. small-scale agricultural landscapes on wild bee communities and their floral resources to improve conservation schemes for pollinators. We sampled bees in Central Germany at the field boundaries of 18 pairs of conventionally and organically managed winter wheat fields along the former iron curtain using pan traps and trap nests. Around traps, we surveyed species richness and flower cover of insect-pollinated forbs. Compared to conventional farming, organic farming was related to higher insect-pollinated forb species richness and flower cover in the field boundaries, presumably due to the lack of herbicide use. Interestingly, small-scale agriculture did not counteract the loss of floral resources under conventional management, as the difference to organic management was even larger in Western small-scale agriculture. Organic farming, but not small-scale agriculture, enhanced species richness of solitary bees, which is in line with their small home ranges. In contrast, bumblebees benefitted only from small-scale agriculture, which matches with their high dispersal ability. Despite similar levels of abundance and diversity of trap-nesting bees in the two landscape types, brood cell parasitism was also higher in small-scale agriculture. Both organic farming and small-scale agriculture directly and indirectly supported different groups of wild bees, suggesting long-term benefits for conservation. Agri-environment schemes should acknowledge the so far neglected benefits of small-scale agriculture for biodiversity and its potential services. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

We used an minimal cognitive approach to create a model of referential communication that is sufficiently minimal to permit a full dynamical analysis, and yet still complex enough so that the results provide a useful perspective onto the processes that could be involved in natural referential communication. The task is for two embodied agents to interact in a ""hive"" area such that one of the agents (the receiver) is able to move to a specific ""target"", the location of which is only available to the other agent (the sender). The task implicitly requires adopting the right role (sender vs. receiver), disambiguating between translational and communicative motion, and switching from communicative to target seeking behavior. Similar to the waggle dance, the best solution involved a correlation between duration of contact and distance to be traveled. Dynamical analysis revealed that this behavior cannot be attributed to the sender in isolation. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

During daily foraging in agricultural landscapes, they encounter a mosaic of patches with nest and foraging habitat and unsuitable matrix. It is insufficiently clear how spatial allocation of nesting and foraging resources and foraging traits of bees affect their daily foraging performance. We investigated potential brood cell construction (as proxy of fitness), number of visited flowers, foraging habitat visitation and foraging distance (pollination proxies) with the model SOLBEE (simulating pollen transport by solitary bees, tested and validated in an earlier study), for landscapes varying in landscape fragmentation and spatial allocation of nesting and foraging resources. Simulated bees varied in body size and nesting preference. We aimed to understand effects of landscape fragmentation and bee traits on bee fitness and the pollination services bees provide, as well as interactions between them, and the general consequences it has to our understanding of the system. This broad scope gives multiple key results. 1) Body size determines fitness more than landscape fragmentation, with large bees building fewer brood cells. High pollen requirements for large bees and the related high time budgets for visiting many flowers may not compensate for faster flight speeds and short handling times on flowers, giving them overall a disadvantage compared to small bees. 2) Nest preference does affect distribution of bees over the landscape, with cavity-nesting bees being restricted to nesting along field edges, which inevitably leads to performance reductions. Fragmentation mitigates this for cavity-nesting bees through increased edge habitat. 3) Landscape fragmentation alone had a relatively small effect on all responses. Instead, the local ratio of nest to foraging habitat affected bee fitness positively through reduced local competition. The spatial coverage of pollination increases steeply in response to this ratio for all bee sizes. The nest to foraging habitat ratio, a strong habitat proxy incorporating fragmentation could be a promising and practical measure for comparing landscape suitability for pollinators. 4) The number of flower visits was hardly affected by resource allocation, but predominantly by bee size. 5) In landscapes with the highest visitation coverage, bees flew least far, suggesting that these pollination proxies are subject to a trade-off between either longer pollen transport distances or a better pollination coverage, linked to how nests are distributed over the landscape rather than being affected by bee size. © 2018 Everaars et al.

Physical communication in ants has been demonstrated to play a role as a modulator of behaviours such as alarm and recruitment. Honeybees can communicate the location of a resource using an advanced motor display—the waggle dance. However, no equivalent of the waggle dance has been described for any ant species, and it is widely believed that ants cannot communicate the location of resources using motor displays. One group of researchers report several demonstrations of such communication in Formica ants; however, these results have been largely ignored. More recently some evidence arose that Lasius niger foragers returning from a food source can communicate to outgoing foragers the direction that should be taken at the next bifurcation by means of physical contact on the trail. Here, we make a concerted effort to replicate these results. Although initial results seemed to indicate physical communication, once stringent controls to eliminate pheromone cues were put in place, no evidence for physical communication of food location could be found. This null result was replicated independently by a different research group on a closely related species, L. neglectus. We conclude that neither L. niger nor L. neglectus foragers communicate resource location using physical contact. Our results increase the burden of proof required for other claims of physical communication of direction in ants, but do not completely rule out this possibility. © 2017, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).",Article,Scopus

About half of the species in the tribe are currently assigned to the genus Eucera and to a few other related genera. In this large genus complex, comprising ca. 390 species, the boundaries between genera remain ambiguous due to morphological intergradation among taxa. Using ca. 6700 aligned nucleotide sites from six gene fragments, 120 morphological characters, and more than 100 taxa, we present the first comprehensive molecular, morphological, and combined phylogenetic analyses of the ‘Eucera complex’. The revised generic classification that we propose is congruent with our phylogeny and maximizes both generic stability and ease of identification. Under this new classification most generic names are synonymized under an expanded genus Eucera. Thus, Tetralonia, Peponapis, Xenoglossa, Cemolobus, and Syntrichalonia are reduced to subgeneric rank within Eucera, and Synhalonia is retained as a subgenus of Eucera. Xenoglossodes is reestablished as a valid subgenus of Eucera while Tetraloniella is synonymized with Tetralonia and Cubitalia with Eucera. In contrast, we suggest that the venusta-group of species, currently placed in the subgenus Synhalonia, should be recognized as a new genus. Our results demonstrate the need to evaluate convergent loss or gain of important diagnostic traits to minimize the use of potentially homoplasious characters when establishing classifications. Lastly, we show that the Eucera complex originated in the Nearctic region in the late Oligocene, and dispersed twice into the Old World.

Its colony is mainly coordinated by the chemical signals such as pheromones produced by queen or brood. Correspondingly, the worker bee developed numerous complicated olfactory sensilla in antennae for detection of these colony chemical signals and nectar/pollen signals in foraging. With the normal development of new emerged workers, young adults (nurse bee) worked in colony at the first 2–3 weeks and then followed by the foraging activity outside of the hive, which give rise to great change of the surrounding chemical signals. However, the olfactory adaption mechanism of worker bee in these processes of behavioral development is still unclear. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of gene expression in Apis mellifera antenna of newly emerged workers, nurses and foragers using transcriptome analysis. Meanwhile, we constructed experimental colonies to collect age-matched samples, which were used to determine whether task is the principal determinant of differential expression. RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that 6 and 14 genes were closely associated with nurse and forager behaviors, respectively. Furthermore, a broad dynamic range of chemosensory gene families and candidate odorant degrading enzymes were analyzed at different behavior statuses. We firstly reported genes associated with nursing/foraging behavior from antennae and the variations of expression of genes belonging to various olfactory gene families at different development stages. These results not only could contribute to elucidating the relationship between olfactory and behavior-related changes, but also provide a new perspective into the molecular mechanism underlying honey bee division of labor. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Article,Scopus

In fact, it is the main purpose of the lives of the working class honeybees. Foraging is essential for the survival of the honeybees and it has significant impact on the pollination of grains in the foraging environment. In order to have proper pollination as well as healthy production of honey, it is necessary to have an optimized environment of foraging. In this article, we provide the study and analysis of honeybee foraging networks. The main aim of this work is to develop a statistical model for honeybee foraging network distances as measured from the beehives. This can be a potential application in improving the yield in apiculture (cultivation of honeybees). We develop a statistical model for honeybee foraging networks in the similar way they are modeled for communication networks. At present, there is no statistical model available for honeybee foraging network distances. This statistical model for honeybee foraging networks can help the apiculture farmers to improve their yield. From our analysis, we find that GEV distribution is suitable for the statistical modeling of honeybee foraging networks. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Therefore, our objective is the utilization of video-tracking to quantify how the acute oral exposure to different doses (0.1–2 ng/bee) of the neonicotinoid “clothianidin” influences the locomotor activity of honeybees in a time course experiment. The total distance moved, resting time as well as the duration and frequency of bouts of laying upside down are measured. Our results show that bees exposed to acute sublethal doses of clothianidin exhibit a significant increase in the total distance moved after 30 and 60 min of the treatment at the highest dose (2 ng/bee). Nevertheless, a reduction of the total distance is observed at this dose 90 min post-treatment compared to the distance of the same group after 30 min, where the treated bees show an arched abdomen and start to lose their postural control. The treated bees with 1 ng clothianidin show a significant increase in total distance moved over the experimental period. Moreover, a reduction in the resting time and increase of the duration and frequency of bouts of laying upside down at these doses are found. Furthermore, significant effects on the tested parameters are observed at the dose (0.5 ng/bee) first at 60 min post-treatment compared to untreated bees.

Interestingly, no scientific data are available, neither about the past nor the present status of naturally nesting honeybee colonies. We expected near-natural beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests to provide enough suitable nest sites to be a home for feral honey bee colonies in Europe. Here, we made a first assessment of their occurrence and density in two German woodland areas based on two methods, the tracing of nest sites based on forager flight routes (beelining technique), and the direct inspection of potential cavity trees. Further, we established experimental swarms at forest edges and decoded dances for nest sites performed by scout bees in order to study how far swarms from beekeepermanaged hives would potentially move into a forest. We found that feral honey bee colonies regularly inhabit tree cavities in near-natural beech forests at densities of at least 0.11-0.14 colonies/km2. Colonies were not confined to the forest edges; they were also living deep inside the forests. We estimated a median distance of 2,600 m from the bee trees to the next apiaries, while scout bees in experimental swarms communicated nest sites in close distances (median: 470 m).We extrapolate that there are several thousand feral honey bee colonies in German woodlands. These have to be taken in account when assessing the role of forest areas in providing pollination services to the surrounding land, and their occurrence has implications for the species' perception among researchers, beekeepers and conservationists.

Using a common bumblebee species from the western United States (Bombus vosnesenskii), we ask whether seasonal decreases in food resources prompt changes in foraging behavior and space use. We employ a unique integration of population genetic tools and spatially explicit foraging models to estimate foraging distances and rates of patch visitation for wild bumblebee colonies across three study regions and two seasons. By mapping the locations of 669 wild-caught individual foragers, we find substantial variation in colony-level foraging distances, often exhibiting a 60-fold difference within a study region. Our analysis of visitation rates indicates that foragers display a preference for destination patches with high floral cover and forage significantly farther for these patches, but only in the summer, when landscape-level resources are low. Overall, these results indicate that an increasing proportion of long-distance foraging bouts take place in the summer. Because wild bees are pollinators, their foraging dynamics are of urgent concern, given the potential impacts of global change on their movement and services. The behavioral shift toward long-distance foraging with seasonal declines in food resources suggests a novel, phenologically directed approach to landscape-level pollinator conservation and greater consideration of late-season floral resources in pollinator habitat management. © 2017 by The University of Chicago.",Article,Scopus

Here, we resequenced the genome of 180 A. cerana individuals from 18 populations throughout China. Using a population genomics approach, we observed considerable genetic variation in A. cerana. Patterns of genetic differentiation indicate high divergence at the subspecies level, and physical barriers rather than distance are the driving force for population divergence. Estimations of divergence time suggested that the main branches diverged between 300 and 500 Ka. Analyses of the population history revealed a substantial influence of the Earth's climate on the effective population size of A. cerana, as increased population sizes were observed during warmer periods. Further analyses identified candidate genes under natural selection that are potentially related to honey bee cognition, temperature adaptation, and olfactory.

The bottom-up modeling paradigm provides an ideal approach to bridging the gap between known mechanisms of individual organisms and unknown spatial–temporal dynamics of pollination at the field scale. By linking empirical data to stochastically-based ecological process modeling, we present a spatially-explicit agent-based simulation model that enables exploration of how various factors, including plant spatial arrangements, outcrossing and self-pollination, bee species compositions and weather conditions, in isolation and combination, affect pollination efficiency throughout a blueberry bloom season. The firmly validated open-source model is a useful tool for hypothesis testing and theory development for wild blueberry pollination researches. Sensitivity analysis suggested that fruit set and resulting measures of productivity such as fruit mass and viable seeds per fruit were sensitive to parameterization of blueberry genotype or clone size and the amount of blueberry plant cover in a field. Fruit set due to pollen compatibility was sensitive to ovule number per flower and foraging bee density. Simulation experiments allowed us to compare bee pollination efficiencies at the bee taxon population level (honey bees, bumble bees, and native solitary bees), the effect of foraging distance from bee nest or colony site on fruit set, and test whether the mechanism of gametophytic self-incompatibility (pre- vs. post-zygotic decision making by the plant) in wild blueberry pollination at the field level matters in estimating yield. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

Thus, in order to overcome this limitation and improve the performance of ABC when dealing with various kinds of optimization problems, we proposed a self-adaptive artificial bee colony algorithm with symmetry initialization (SABC-SI). In our SABC-SI algorithm, a novel population initialization method based on half space and symmetry is designed, and such method can increase the diversity of initial solutions. Besides, a selfadaptive search mechanism and several new Candidate Solution Generating Strategies (CSGSes) have also been developed. Consequently, the evolutionary strategies can be selected dynamically according to their search performance. Moreover, the selection operator is improved by eliminating some of the poor solutions and making good use of the two best solutions in both the current and previous generations.

Color vision has been proved in these species, and they are known to predominantly visit flowers using visual signals to collect nutrition. Surprisingly, however, the natural variability of flower signals has been rarely considered, and recent work also suggests bees may tune color vision through experience. We initially measured the spectral variability of flowers from 2 species: Goodenia ovata and Rosemarinus officinalis where free-flying honeybees were observed constantly foraging from conspecific flowers. We empirically determined honeybee color discrimination thresholds for color stimuli considering either absolute- or differential- conditioning discrimination functions. Secondly, we analyzed greenhouse grown wild-type Antirrhinum majus flower petal spectra as well as spectra from mixta and nivea strains of this species, and empirically determined bumblebee color discrimination considering conditioning experience. In all measured cases, within-flower type spectral variability exceeded a 1.0 Receptor Noise threshold, often by several units.

To investigate if such exposure is detrimental to bees, many studies have exclusively fed individuals with pesticide-spiked food, informing us about the hazard but not necessarily the risk of exposure. While such studies are important to establish the physiological and behavioural effects on individuals, they do not consider the possibility that the risk of exposure may change over time. For example, many pesticide assays exclude potential behavioural adaptations to novel toxins, such as rejection of harmful compounds by choosing to feed on an uncontaminated food source, thus behaviourally lowering the risk of exposure. In this paper, we conducted an experiment over 10 days in which bumblebees could forage on an array of sucrose feeders containing 0, 2 and 11 parts per billion of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam. This more closely mimics pesticide exposure in the wild by allowing foraging bees to (i) experience a field realistic range of pesticide concentrations across a chronic exposure period, (ii) have repeated interactions with the pesticide in their environment, and (iii) retain the social cues associated with foraging by using whole colonies. We found that the proportion of visits to pesticide-laced feeders increased over time, resulting in greater consumption of pesticide-laced sucrose relative to untreated sucrose. After changing the spatial position of each feeder, foragers continued to preferentially visit the pesticide-laced feeders which indicates that workers can detect thiamethoxam and alter their behaviour to continue feeding on it. The increasing preference for consuming the neonicotinoid- treated food therefore increases the risk of exposure for the colony during prolonged pesticide exposure. Our results highlight the need to incorporate attractiveness of pesticides to foraging bees (and potentially other insect pollinators) in addition to simply considering the proportion of pesticide-contaminated floral resources within the foraging landscape. © 2019 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

We examine the relationship between the distinct floral characteristics of T. laniflora and its pollination syndrome and reproduction ecology. We observed different individuals of T. laniflora randomly sampled in Serra do Cipó Espinhaço Range, Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. We carried out observations on their reproductive phenology (31 individuals), flower biology (3), pollination (23), and tested the reproductive system (29). Trembleya laniflora presented a seasonal flowering pattern in the dry and post-dry seasons (May–October) and set fruits during the dry, post-dry and rainy seasons (June–December). Floral aperture occurred mainly during the night and the first hours of the morning, the period with the greatest availability of fresh flowers and with the highest visitation by Xylocopa bimaculata. Tests identified the species as non-apomictic, self-incompatible and dependent on large bees such as Xylocopa, Bombus, Centris and Ptiloglossa for pollination. Trembleya laniflora showed a specialized pollination system mediated by a restricted group of bees that perform crepuscular buzz pollination. Floral characteristics and reproductive biology of T. laniflora are likely adaptive responses to pollination by large bees foraging during the crepuscular hours. Our results support the “pollination syndrome” hypothesis, demonstrating a direct relationship between a set of floral characters and the principal pollinators of the species. Dependence on interbreeding may promote outcrossing within and among the endemic populations, naturally isolated on rocky outcrops. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH",Article,Scopus

Gaertn grows almost throughout the year if the soil is damp. It produces heterogamous capitula with female ray florets anthesing on the first day and bisexual disc florets anthesing on the next three consecutive days. Disc florets are dichogamous, herkogamous, self-compatible, self-pollinating (vector-mediated) and display secondary pollen presentation through an intermediate form of brush mechanism. Ray and disc florets exhibit facultative xenogamy. Butterflies are principal pollinators while bees, wasps and flies are supplementary pollinators. Thrips Microcephalothrips abdominalis uses the florets as breeding and feeding sites; the feeding activity effects pollination. The ray and disc florets produce cypselas; the cypselas produced by ray florets are heavier, elliptical, membranous with upwardly-pointing teeth along the margins and two short terminal awns while those produced by disc florets are lighter, cylindrical and tangentially compressed with 2 or 3 stiff terminal divaricate awns. Seed dispersal is polychorous and represented by anemochory, anthropochory, zoochory and ombrohydrochory. Cypselas of ray florets disperse to short distances and germinate under specific germination conditions either at parental sites or in similar habitats while those of disc florets disperse farther away from parental sites and germinate readily under a wide range of conditions. Therefore, bimorphic cypselas with different germination abilities enable the plant to grow as a widespread weed but not as an invasive weed. © Usharani & Raju 2018.",Article,Scopus

As we designed the simulation, we iteratively analyzed the ways that children in a range of low-tech and high-tech conditions engaged in creating a nonverbal system of communication.

This study was carried out over a period of 2 years (July 2012 to June 2014) in the arid agricultural landscape of Pothwar Plateau, Pakistan, to identify adaptations that govern bird distribution and abundance across 2 different cropping systems associated with differences in water availability. We used regular surveys and foraging observations to quantify species abundance, distribution, and habits. We then examined morphological correlations with ecological attributes. We found the following: (1) larger birds tended to spend more time in trees; (2) birds with small beaks and relatively long wings more commonly forage on the ground; (3) birds with narrow and long beaks and long tarsi were more likely to be insectivorous in habits. Of these associations, only the third axis, bill stubbiness and short tarsus, correlated with feeding on crops, implying that feeding on plant material is one preadaptation to crop exploitation. Bird abundance was not correlated with feeding on crops. This is because some common species are crop exploiters, but other common species feed on secondary growth (e.g., bulbuls, Pycnonotus spp.) or may be common in this region even in the absence of humans (e.g., the green bee-eater, Merops orientalis). The best predictor of distribution was not crop-feeding but abundance. This appears to be because common species feed on a set of resources that are common everywhere, whereas range-restricted species are found in areas with water—but even in these areas, water is scarce. © 2018, Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences.

In this paper, we explore information exchange design patterns for robot swarm foraging. First, a method for the specification of design patterns for robot swarms is proposed that builds on previous work in this field and emphasises modular behaviour design, as well as information-centric micro-macro link analysis. Next, design pattern application rules that can facilitate the pattern usage in robot control algorithms are given. A catalogue of six design patterns is then presented. The patterns are derived from an extensive list of experiments reported in the swarm robotics literature, demonstrating the capability of the proposed method to identify distinguishing features of robot behaviour and their impact on swarm performance in a wide range of swarm implementations and experimental scenarios. Each pattern features a detailed description of robot behaviour and its associated parameters, facilitated by the usage of a multi-agent modeling language, BDRML, and an account of feedback loops and forces that affect the pattern's applicability. Scenarios in which the pattern has been used are described. The consequences of each design pattern on overall swarm performance are characterised within the Information-Cost-Reward framework, that makes it possible to formally relate the way in which robots acquire, share and utilise information. Finally, the patterns are validated by demonstrating how they improved the performance of foraging e-puck swarms and how they could guide algorithm design in other scenarios. © 2018 Pitonakova, Crowder and Bullock.",Article,Scopus

Populations of this species are highly threatened in large parts of its range due to overexploitation and environmental degradation. In the light of climatic changes, safeguarding the genetic diversity of the species is crucial to foster adaptation and to support its long-term survival. Genetic insight is also relevant to guide sustainable harvesting. This paper has the objective to review information on the species' geographic distribution, reproductive biology, genetic characteristics and existing conservation practices, and to identify knowledge gaps to orientate future conservation and research focus. The literature review revealed that the species is mainly outcrossed and is pollinated by a diversity of vectors, including bats that allow long-pollen dispersal. When bats are absent, pollination is mainly carried out by honey bees and stingless bees and in such case pollen-mediated gene flow is relatively restricted. Data of a large-scale genetic study based on allozyme markers showing a moderate genetic differentiation among populations were reanalyzed using an inverse distance weighted interpolation function. Three distinctive regions of diversity based on allelic richness and expected heterozygosity were identified. Finally, we discuss future challenges for genetic conservation by emphasizing the need to use both neutral and adaptive markers in future research. © 2018 Silvae Genetica.

Forager bees direct their nestmates to profitable resources via a complex motor display. Essentially, the dance encodes the polar coordinates to the resource in the field. Unemployed foragers follow the dancer’s movements and then search for the advertised spots in the field. Throughout the last decades, biologists have employed different techniques to measure key characteristics of the waggle dance and decode the information it conveys. Early techniques involved the use of protractors and stopwatches to measure the dance orientation and duration directly from the observation hive. Recent approaches employ digital video recordings and manual measurements on screen. However, manual approaches are very time-consuming. Most studies, therefore, regard only small numbers of animals in short periods of time. We have developed a system capable of automatically detecting, decoding and mapping communication dances in real-time. In this paper, we describe our recording setup, the image processing steps performed for dance detection and decoding and an algorithm to map dances to the field. The proposed system performs with a detection accuracy of 90.07%. The decoded waggle orientation has an average error of -2.92 (± 7.37), well within the range of human error. To evaluate and exemplify the system’s performance, a group of bees was trained to an artificial feeder, and all dances in the colony were automatically detected, decoded and mapped. The system presented here is the first of this kind made publicly available, including source code and hardware specifications. We hope this will foster quantitative analyses of the honey bee waggle dance. Copyright: © 2017 Wario et al.

We explored bumblebees’ route development on an array of five artificial flowers in which minimising travel distances between individual feeders conflicted with minimising overall distance. No previous study of bee spatial navigation has been able to follow animals’ movement during learning; we tracked bumblebee foragers continuously, using harmonic radar, and examined the process of route formation in detail for a small number of selected individuals. On our array, bees did not settle on visit sequences that gave the shortest overall path, but prioritised movements to nearby feeders. Nonetheless, flight distance and duration reduced with experience. This increased efficiency was attributable mainly to experienced bees reducing exploration beyond the feeder array and flights becoming straighter with experience, rather than improvements in the sequence of feeder visits. Flight paths of all legs of a flight stabilised at similar rates, whereas the first few feeder visits became fixed early while bees continued to experiment with the order of later visits. Stabilising early sections of a route and prioritising travel between nearby destinations may reduce the search space, allowing rapid adoption of efficient routes. © 2017, The Author(s).",Article,Scopus

We tested the effects of acute or chronic exposure to thiamethoxam on the flight ability of foragers in flight mills. Within 1 h of consuming a single sublethal dose (1.34 ng/bee), foragers showed excitation and significantly increased flight duration (+78%) and distance (+72%). Chronic exposure significantly decreased flight duration (-54%), distance (-56%), and average velocity (-7%) after either one or two days of continuous exposure that resulted in bees ingesting field-relevant thiamethoxam doses of 1.96-2.90 ng/bee/day.

However, the available data are limited and inconclusive in the case of the frequency of wing beats. Therefore, in this study, the hypothesis that the wing beats convey information about the foraging distance was re-examined. Honeybee dances were recorded using a high-speed camera, and foraging distances were decoded from the duration of waggle phases. Dancing honeybees moved their wings for almost half (47%) of the duration of waggle phases. The number of wing-beating pulses and the combined duration of wing beating were strongly positively correlated with the duration of waggle phases (p <.0014), whereas the mean frequency of wing beats, the mean duration of wing-beating pulses and the mean number of wing beats in one wing-beating pulse were not correlated with the duration of waggle phases (p >.05). Nevertheless, both the mean frequency of wing beats and the mean number of wing beats in one wing-beating pulse were positively correlated with the mean frequency of abdomen waggles (p <.0014). They were also positively correlated with the mean frequency of wing-beating pulses (p <.0014). The correlation matrix revealed that there were two groups of dance components that were positively correlated within groups, but negatively correlated between groups. One of the groups provided information about distance to the food source. We hypothesise that the other group, including the number of wing beats in one pulse, the frequency of wing beats, the frequency of wing-beating pulses and the frequency of abdomen waggles, may provide information about the motivational state of foragers. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",Article,Scopus

Notably, among the total 231 PKs in honeybee proteome, 179 novel PKs were predicted in the honeybee brain, of which 88 were experimentally identified. Proteins involved in wide scenarios of pathways were phosphorylated depending on age: Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, AGE/RAGE and phosphorylation in nurse bees and metal ion transport, ATP metabolic process and phototransduction in forager bees. These observations suggest that phosphorylation is vital to the tuning of protein activity to regulate cerebral function according to the biological duties as nursing and foraging bees. The data provides valuable information on phosphorylation signaling in the honeybee brain and potentially useful resource to understand the signaling mechanism in honeybee neurobiology and in other social insects as well. © 2017 The Author(s).",Article,Scopus

Honeybees are natural foragers; they travel long distances in search for water, nectar, propolis and pollen. Researchers aim to use these factors for the welfare of mankind, taking advantage of the behavioral characteristics of honeybees to use them as a basis for developing natural biosensors. Through the use of a honeybee sensor system, one can train thousands of bees to seek many kind of odor. This finally results in a very simple to use but powerful real biosensor, potentially much more efficient than any electronic sensor. This review briefly outlines the sniffer technology of honeybees for deploying them as highly sensitive, accurate and cost effective biosensors.

Here, we investigated several skilled, aerial pursuers (males of four insect species), measuring the targetdetection limit (signal-to-noise ratio) of light-adapted photoreceptors. We recorded intracellular responses to moving targets of varying size, extended well below the nominal resolution of single ommatidia. We found that the signal detection limit (2× photoreceptor noise) matches physiological or behavioural target-detection thresholds observed in each species. Thus, across a diverse range of flying insects, individual photoreceptor responses to changes in light intensity establish the sensitivity of the feature detection pathway, indicating later stages of processing are dedicated to feature tuning, tracking and selection. © 2017.

Understanding how much the honeybees depend on natural and human-influenced plants and landscapes in different climates is important could contribute to evaluate how wild honeybees use food resources and to measure the ecosystem services. We investigated the effects of land use and climate changes on stable nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios in wild populations of A. cerana. In populations from 139 individual sites throughout Japan, we measured nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) stable isotope ratios and analyzed the effects of land use and climate. Our results showed that forested areas and annual precipitation had significant effects on δ15N, and that paddy fields and urban areas had significant effects on δ13C. These results suggest that A. cerana sensibly uses available food resources in the various environments and that stable nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios clearly reflect the effects of land use and climate changes on the populations of A. cerana.

Results showed variable frequencies of gene flow between GM and non-GM oilseed rape cultivars, with the highest frequency under nylon net isolation with artificially stocked honeybees, the lowest frequency under nylon net isolation alone, and an intermediate frequency under natural pollination, suggesting the important role of honeybee foraging in gene flow frequency. Additionally, GM pollen grains were found in honey collected from honeybees foraging on both GM and non-GM oilseed rape cultivars.

While threats to bees are numerous, few analyses have attempted to understand the relative importance of multiple stressors. Such analyses are critical for prioritizing conservation strategies. Here, we describe a landscape analysis of factors predicted to cause bumblebee declines in the USA. We quantified 24 habitat, land-use and pesticide usage variables across 284 sampling locations, assessing which variables predicted pathogen prevalence and range contractions via machine learning model selection techniques. We found that greater usage of the fungicide chlorothalonil was the best predictor of pathogen (Nosema bombi) prevalence in four declining species of bumblebees. Nosema bombi has previously been found in greater prevalence in some declining US bumblebee species compared to stable species. Greater usage of total fungicides was the strongest predictor of range contractions in declining species, with bumblebees in the northern USA experiencing greater likelihood of loss from previously occupied areas. These results extend several recent laboratory and semifield studies that have found surprising links between fungicide exposure and bee health. Specifically, our data suggest landscape-scale connections between fungicide usage, pathogen prevalence and declines of threatened and endangered bumblebees. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

However, past functional studies have focused largely on seed production; although useful, this focus on seed set does not provide information regarding species-specific contributions to pollen-mediated gene flow. Here we quantify pollen dispersal for individual pollinator species across more than 690 ha of tropical forest. Specifically, we examine visitation, seed production, and pollen-dispersal ability for the entire pollinator community of a common tropical tree using a series of individual-based pollinator-exclusion experiments followed by molecular-based fractional paternity analyses. We investigate the effects of pollinator body size, plant size (as a proxy of floral display), local plant density, and local plant kinship on seed production and pollen-dispersal distance. Our results show that while large-bodied pollinators set more seeds per visit, small-bodied bees visited flowers more frequently and were responsible for more than 49% of all long-distance (beyond 1 km) pollen-dispersal events. Thus, despite their size, small-bodied bees play a critical role in facilitating long-distance pollen-mediated gene flow. We also found that both plant size and local plant kinship negatively impact pollen dispersal and seed production. By incorporating genetic and trait-based data into the quantification of pollination services, we highlight the diversity in ecological function mediated by pollinators, the influential role that plant and population attributes play in driving service provision, and the unexpected importance of small-bodied pollinators in the recruitment of plant genetic diversity. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

Michigan also has the second most diverse agriculture in the country, with many crops that depend on bees for pollination. This unique combination provides a wide range of opportunities for bees to persist, yet there is no current published checklist of these important insects. This study was conducted to provide the first annotated checklist of the bee (Apoidea: Anthophila) fauna of Michigan, summarizing aspects of their taxonomy and behavior and to provide provisional conservation assessment. The list was compiled from a critical review of published literature, museum specimens, and database records, supplemented by new collections. In total, 465 species are included in the checklist, including 38 new records, however evidence for 13 species is poor, several more species require taxonomic revision, and the presence of additional species is expected.

New state records of native species include Anthidium tenuiflorae Cockerell and Nomada alpha alpha Cockerell, both previously undocumented from eastern North America, and Nomada sphaerogaster Cockerell, which has rarely been recognized. The taxonomy of some bee species is clarified by the formal publication of 11 new synonymies (some previously reported online or in manuscripts). The following list cites junior synonyms first followed by the valid name: Andrena chippewaensis Mitchell 1960 = A. (Simandrena) wheeleri Graenicher 1904; Osmia hendersoni Cockerell 1907 = O.

During the wall-following task, the CFLC inputs measure the distance between the ultrasonic sensors and the wall, and the outputs of the CFLC are the robot's left-wheel and right-wheel speeds. A cost function is defined to evaluate the performance of the CFLC in the wall-following task. The cost function includes three control factors (CF) which are defined as follows: maintaining a user-defined robot-wall distance, avoiding robot-wall collision, and ensuring that the robot can successfully negotiate the venue. The original artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) simulates the intelligent foraging behavior of honey-bee swarms, which are good at exploration but poor at exploitation. An improved ABC algorithm, the IABC algorithm, is proposed that adopts the mutation strategies of differential evolution to balance exploration and exploitation. The IABC algorithm applies a new reward-based roulette wheel selection where an obtained a better solution by gains a reward during the learning stage. To demonstrate the performance of the IABC designed CFLC, the method was compared with other population-based algorithms with respect to the efficiency of the wall-following task. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

To uncover the neural mechanisms underlying the encoding of distance information in the waggle dance follower, we investigated morphology, physiology, and immunohistochemistry of interneurons arborizing in the primary auditory center of the honeybee (Apis mellifera). We identified major interneuron types, named DL-Int-1, DL-Int-2, and bilateral DL-dSEG-LP, that responded with different spiking patterns to vibration pulses applied to the antennae.

We examined the route-choice behavior of foraging honeybees when they encountered a barrier which could be traversed by flying through one of two apertures, positioned side by side. When the bees’ choice behavior was averaged over the entire tested population, the two apertures were chosen with equal frequency when they were equally wide. When the apertures were of different width, the bees, on average, showed a preference for the wider aperture, which increased sharply with the difference between the aperture widths. Thus, bees are able to discriminate the widths of oncoming gaps and choose the passage which is presumably safer and quicker to transit. Examination of the behavior of individual bees revealed that, when the two apertures were equally wide, ca. 55% of the bees displayed no side bias in their choices. However, the remaining 45% showed varying degrees of bias, with one half of them preferring the left-hand aperture, and the other half the right-hand aperture. The existence of distinct individual biases was confirmed by measuring the times required by biased bees to transit various aperture configurations: The transit time was longer if a bee’s intrinsic bias forced it to engage with the narrower aperture. Our results show that, at the population level, bees do not exhibit ‘handedness’ in choosing routes; however, individual bees display an idiosyncratic bias that can range from a strong left bias, through zero bias, to a strong right bias. In honeybees, previous studies of olfactory and visual learning have demonstrated clear biases at the population level. To our knowledge, our study is the first to uncover the existence of individually distinct biases in honeybees. We also show how a distribution of biases among individual honeybees can be advantageous in facilitating rapid transit of a group of bees through a cluttered environment, without any centralized decision-making or control. © 2017 Ong et al.

However, there is often intensive use of systemic pesticides in crops, which can be carried to the colony by forage bees through the collection of contaminated pollen and nectar. Inside the colony, pollen loads are stored by bees that add honey and several enzymes to this pollen. Nevertheless, intra-colonial chronic exposure could induce sublethal effects in young bees exposed to a wide range of pesticides present in these pollen loads. This study was aimed to both determine the survival rate and evaluate the sublethal effects on the hepato-nephrocitic system in response to continuous oral exposure to lower concentrations of neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (TXT) and picoxystrobin fungicide (PXT). Exposure to a single chemical and co-exposure to both pesticides were performed in newly emerged honeybee workers. A significant decrease in the bee survival rates was observed following exposure to TXT (0.001 ng a.i./μL) and PXT (0.018 ng a.i./μL), as well as following co-exposure to TXT+PXT/2. After five days of continuous exposure, TXT induced sub-lethal effects in the organs involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, such as the fat body and pericardial cells, and it also induced a significant increase in the hemocyte number. Thus, the hepato-nephrocitic system (HNS) reached the greatest level of activity of pericardial cells as an attempt to eliminate this toxic compound from hemolymph. The HNS was activated at low levels by PXT without an increase in the hemocyte number; however, the mobilization of neutral glycoconjugates from the trophocytes of the fat body was prominent only in this group. TXT and PXT co-exposure induced intermediary morphological effects in trophocytes and pericardial cells, but oenocytes from the fat body presented with atypical cytoplasm granulation only in this group. These data showed that the realistic concentrations of these pesticides are harmful to newly emerged Africanized honeybees, indicating that intra-colonial chronic exposure drastically reduces the longevity of bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticide (TXT) and the fungicide strobilurin (PXT) as in single and co-exposure. Additionally, the sublethal effects observed in the organs constituting the HNS suggest that the activation of this system, even during exposure to low concentrations of theses pesticides, is an attempt to maintain homeostasis of the bees. These data together are alarming because these pesticides can affect the performance of the entire colony. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

Here, we investigate how an entire assemblage of orchid bees responded to the effects of forest habitat loss, isolation and forest canopy degradation induced by a hydroelectric reservoir of Central Brazilian Amazonia. Built in 1986, the Balbina Dam resulted in a vast archipelagic landscape containing 3546 primary forest islands of varying sizes and isolation, surrounded by 3129 km2 of freshwater. Using scent traps, we sampled 34 islands, 14 open-water matrix sites, and three mainland continuous forests, yielding 2870 male orchid bees representing 25 species. Local orchid bee species richness was affected by forest patch area but particularly by site isolation. Distance to forest edges, either within forest areas or into the open-water matrix, was the most important predictor of species richness and composition. Variation in matrix dispersal of individual species to increasingly isolated sites was a key determinant of community structure.

Nest transportation can change the genetic structure of the host population, reducing inbreeding and increasing homogenization. Here, we evaluate the genetic structure of 17 geographic populations of T. angustula in southern Brazil to quantify the level of genetic differentiation between populations. Analyses were conducted on partially sequenced mitochondrial genes and 11 microsatellite loci of 1002 workers from 457 sites distributed on the mainland and on 3 islands. Our results show that T. angustula populations are highly differentiated as demonstrated by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite markers. Of 73 haplotypes, 67 were population-specific. MtDNA diversity was low in 9 populations but microsatellite diversity was moderate to high in all populations. Microsatellite data suggest 10 genetic clusters and low level of gene flow throughout the studied area. However, physical barriers, such as rivers and mountain ranges, or the presence or absence of forest appear to be unrelated to population clusters. Factors such as low dispersal, different ecological conditions, and isolation by distance are most likely shaping the population structure of this species. Thus far, nest transportation has not influenced the general population structure in the studied area. However, due to the genetic structure we found, we recommend that nest transportation should only occur within and between populations that are genetically similar. © 2016 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences",Article,Scopus

In response, insect pollinators show shifts in range and phenology, interactions with plants and other taxa are altered, and in some cases pollination services have diminished. Recent studies show some pollinators are tracking climate change by moving latitudinally and elevationally, while others are not. Shifts in insect pollinator phenology generally keep pace with advances in flowering, although there are exceptions. Recent data demonstrate competition between exotic and native bees, along with rapid positive effects of exotic plant removal on pollinator richness.

The chemical management of pests can affect non-target organisms, including honey bees. Risk assessment is a way to evaluate the cost-benefit of pesticide use to honey bees and involves understanding the exposure routes and hazards posed by each particular pesticide. The effects of insecticides on bees are intuitively recognized, but other types of pesticides can affect honey bees too. Even ""inactive"" ingredients in a pesticide formulation can pose a risk to bees. Bees encounter pesticides as they forage in the environment through direct exposure to pesticide applications, and through contaminated resources such as pollen, nectar, water, comb, and propolis. Pesticides can affect bees in myriad ways. The toxicity of pesticides is highly context-specific, challenging risk assessments. Mortality is the most commonly measured effect of pesticides on bees but sublethal effects range from developmental problems, reduced reproductive fitness, diminished overwintering capacity, and numerous behavioral issues that may not kill the bee outright, but may kill the hives. The pervasiveness of pesticides in the environment means that bees cannot avoid exposure to numerous chemicals. Selecting for bees that are adapted to agrichemical-intensive landscapes may be a short-term solution, but the dynamic evolution of chemical use may prohibit long-term tolerances. Beekeepers and farmers need to work together to create and promote reduced chemical intensive food production systems. This is the only long-term answer for the survival of honey bees and biodiversity in general. Broad scale simplification of the landscape accompanied the rise of industrial-scale food production, and a variety of agrichemicals are used to support these monoculture-based systems. Biodiversity provides substantial resistance to the proliferation of pests in a variety of ways, but this diversity is removed from our food production systems in order to maximize short-term production goals. In the absence of biotic resistance to pest proliferation, land managers rely on pesticides to replace the pest management function provided by diverse biological communities. The downside is these pesticides do not solve the causative problem that produced the pest. Within this context, pests become resistant, and more and new pesticides are required to maintain pests at low densities in a system that is designed for them to excel (i.e., the pesticide treadmill). This is the environment into which honey bees and other pollinators have been inserted, and pesticides inherent in these systems affect pollinators in complex ways. Pesticides are not intended to hurt bees or any other beneficial organisms, but they often do; estimating this harm is called risk assessment. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Book Chapter,Scopus

The innate immune system includes the circulating hemocytes (immune cells) that clear pathogens from hemolymph (blood) by phagocytosis, nodulation or encapsulation. Honey bee hemocyte numbers have been linked to hemolymph levels of vitellogenin. Vitellogenin is a multifunctional protein with immune-supportive functions identified in a range of species, including the honey bee. Hemocyte numbers can increase via mitosis, and this recruitment process can be important for immune system function and maintenance. Here, we tested if hemocyte mediated phagocytosis differs among the physiologically different honey bee worker castes (nurses, foragers and winter bees), and study possible interactions with vitellogenin and hemocyte recruitment. To this end, we adapted phagocytosis assays, which—together with confocal microscopy and flow cytometry—allow qualitative and quantitative assessment of hemocyte performance. We found that nurses are more efficient in phagocytic uptake than both foragers and winter bees. We detected vitellogenin within the hemocytes, and found that winter bees have the highest numbers of vitellogenin-positive hemocytes. Connections between phagocytosis, hemocyte-vitellogenin and mitosis were worker caste dependent. Our results demonstrate that the phagocytic performance of immune cells differs significantly between honey bee worker castes, and support increased immune competence in nurses as compared to forager bees. Our data, moreover, provides support for roles of vitellogenin in hemocyte activity. © 2017 Hystad et al.

However, the impact of short- and long-term temporal resource availability on biodiversity has been less explored. This is highly relevant in tropical agricultural systems for pollinators, as many foraging periods of pollinators extend beyond flowering of any single crop species. In this study, we sought to understand how bee communities in tropical agroecosystems changed between seasons, and if short- and long-term floral resource availability influenced their diversity and abundance. We used a threshold analysis approach in order to explore this relationship at two time scales. This study took place in a region dominated by coffee agroecosystems in Southern Mexico. This was an ideal system because the landscape offers a range of coffee management regimes that maintain heterogeneity in floral resource availability spatially and temporally. We found that the bee community varies significantly between seasons. There were higher abundances of native social, solitary and managed honey bees during the dry season when coffee flowers. Additionally, we found that floral resources from groundcover, but not trees, were associated with bee abundance. Further, the temporal scale of the availability of these resources is important, whereby short-term floral resource availability appears particularly important in maintaining high bee abundance at sites with lower seasonal complementarity. We argue that in addition to spatial resource heterogeneity, temporal resource heterogeneity is critical in explaining bee community patterns, and should thus be considered to promote pollinator conservation. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus

However, little attention has been paid to man-made structures that can moderate spatial processes affecting pollinator communities. In a large-scale study, we explored the importance of railway embankments for the turnover of pollinator species in agricultural landscapes. Because species differ in vulnerability to landscape composition and patch configuration, we also accounted for body size as well as food specialization of pollinators. Location: Kraków area, Poland. Methods: We sampled pollinating insects (bees, butterflies and hoverflies), at 25 study sites located along railway lines in the region of Kraków, Poland. Control grasslands for the embankments included 19 patches, located among crop fields, in which pollinators were sampled. We assessed the relationships between dissimilarity and distance for bee, butterfly and hoverfly trait groups on embankments and grasslands using Moran's Eigenvector Maps. Results: The dissimilarity for food-non-specialized bees on embankments was spatially structured: sites that were closer together were also less dissimilar in their community composition than more distant ones. Dissimilarity was also spatially aligned for large-bodied butterflies and hoverflies on embankments. The species dissimilarity of pollinators divided into trait-based groups was not spatially structured on grasslands. Main conclusion: Our study highlights the potential function of railway embankments as corridors for at least some pollinator populations. Landscape managers should include railways in green networks to improve spatial processes linked with the distribution and turnover of pollinator species in agricultural landscapes. Thus, railway embankments and their correct management may be a good example of man-made alterations in the environment that meet the demands of both civilization and biodiversity conservation. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus

Hedgerows are an important component of the landscape in many farming systems across the world, management of which provides a potential mechanism to enhance ecological intensification. Here we investigate the value of hedgerows in Southern England as a source of functionally important taxa, and how hedgerow quality and local landscape composition impact on their potential contribution to sustainable agriculture in arable landscapes. We show that hedgerows are a source habitat for many natural enemies which spill over into neighbouring fields, and that hedgerows provide a valuable forage resource and corridor for movement of pollinators. Hedgerow quality affects these benefits and continuous unbroken hedgerows, with a high diversity of woody species, are more valuable for the provision of bumblebees and Linyphiid spiders, while the presence of trees within the hedgerow supports Lycosid spiders. Floral resources, beyond the woody hedgerow species themselves, are also a key forage resource for hoverflies. The impact of these hedgerows on invertebrate abundance is moderated by local landscape, and hedgerows are a more valuable forage resource for pollinators in more intensely managed landscapes. Our study shows that in order to support abundant and a broad range of natural enemies and pollinators in agricultural landscapes, both hedgerows and local semi-natural habitats need to be protected and managed. The benefit of hedgerows, as a habitat for functionally important taxa depends on hedgerow quality and management practices such as avoiding gaps, high hedge species diversity and maintaining an abundant understory of plants, can improve their value for ecological intensification. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Serratula tinctoria is a gynodioecious perennial forb of open or semi-shaded habitats including grassland, heath, mire, open woodland and scrub and their ecotones. It is found throughout most of England and Wales but it is very rare in Scotland and absent from Ireland. Serratula tinctoria is found in Europe as far north as southern Sweden and Norway. It is absent from much of the Boreal biogeographical zone, including most of Fennoscandia and northern Poland, Russia and the Baltic States, and from the lowland Mediterranean zone. Serratula tinctoria occurs on soils overlying a wide variety of superficial deposits and sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks, including ultramafic rocks. The pH range of these soils is wide, ranging from acidic to moderately alkaline but with nutrient status classed as oligotrophic, or more rarely mesotrophic. In mire or fen habitats, it occurs in topogenous or soligenous situations with a similar soil water pH range. It is able to tolerate a wide spectrum of soil water-table conditions, ranging from very dry to flooded. Serratula tinctoria is pollinated by various insects of the orders Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera, particularly bumblebees, hoverflies and butterflies. It produces phytoecdysteroids, which mimic a hormone that regulates insect development. The seed has a feathery pappus for wind dispersal and establishment is primarily from seed. However, it has strong dispersal limitation with slow migration rates into restored grasslands of 1 m year−1. The species has a short-term persistent seed bank. Seedling recruitment is enhanced by disturbance that creates bare ground, increasing light flux and lower cover of bryophytes and litter, and reduced by higher nutrient availability and lack of management. Formerly the source of a yellow dye, S. tinctoria has declined in Britain since at least the late 19th Century primarily due to a combination of drainage, ploughing and agricultural improvement and, conversely, lack of management by cutting and grazing in its grassland, heath and mire habitats. There is evidence that the decline slowed or stabilised between the late-1980s and the mid-2000s, in part due to the positive impact of conservation via statutory protection on designated sites and wider measures delivered through agri-environment schemes. © 2017 The Authors.

This species has become naturalized in many zones of Chile and southern Argentina, and may potentially invade other regions and countries in South America. These naturalized populations of B. terrestris have been associated with rapid population declines of the native bee B. dahlbomii Guérin-Méneville. We report new records of the exotic bee B. terrestris in the Region de Arica y Parinacota in the far north of Chile, which includes portions of the Atacama Desert. We used species distribution models (SDMs) and multivariate analyses to evaluate whether these occurrences represent new escapes from managed colonies or natural dispersal of the species from its southern invaded range. These reports of B. terrestris indicate a northward expansion of this bee. In our analyses, these new areas of occurrences have environmental conditions similar to those observed in the species’ southern invaded range, and our SDMs predict that B. terrestris dispersal through the Atacama is possible, although not likely given the occasional flower blooming in that region of Chile. These new occurrences in northern Chile reflect a potential for future invasion into other regions of South America by B. terrestris.

The ability of pollinating insects to discover and evade their predators can affect plant–pollinator mutualisms and have cascading ecosystem effects. Pollinators will avoid flowers with predators, but it is not clear how far away they will move to continue foraging. If these distances are relatively small, the impact of predators on the plant–pollinator mutualism may be lessened. The plant could continue to receive some pollination, and pollinators would reduce the time and energy needed to search for another patch. 2. A native crab spider, Xysticus elegans, was placed on one cluster in a small array of Baccharis pilularis inflorescence clusters, and the preferred short-range foraging distances of naturally visiting pollinators was determined. 3. Nearly all pollinator taxa (honey bees, wasps, other Hymenoptera, and non-bombyliid flies) spent less time foraging on the predator cluster. 4. The key result of this study is that inflorescences within 90 mm of the crab spider were avoided by visiting honey bees and wasps, which spent three- and 18-fold more time, respectively, foraging on more distant flower clusters. 5. Whether honey bees can use olfaction to detect spiders was then tested, and this study provides the first demonstration that honey bees will avoid crab spider odour alone at a food source. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society",Article,Scopus

The quantity and diversity of collected pollen can influence the growth and health of honey bee colonies, but little is known about the influence of landscape structure on pollen diet. In a field experiment, we rotated 16 honey bee colonies across 16 agricultural landscapes, used traps to collect samples of collected pollen and observed intra-colonial dance communication to gain information about foraging distances. DNA metabarcoding was applied to analyze mixed pollen samples. Neither the amount of collected pollen nor pollen diversity was related to landscape diversity. However, we found a strong seasonal variation in the amount and diversity of collected pollen in all sites independent of landscape diversity. The observed increase in foraging distances with decreasing landscape diversity suggests that honey bees compensated for lower landscape diversity by increasing their pollen foraging range in order to maintain pollen amount and diversity. Our results underscore the importance of a diverse pollen diet for honey bee colonies. Agri-environmental schemes aiming to support pollinators should focus on possible spatial and temporal gaps in pollen availability and diversity in agricultural landscapes. © 2017 Danner et al.

However, links between pollinator activity and multiple paternity are generally lacking, especially for plant species that attract functionally diverse floral visitors. In this study, we separated the influence of two functionally distinct floral visitors (hawkmoths and solitary bees) and characterized their impacts on multiple paternity in a self-incompatible, annual forb, Oenothera harringtonii (Onagraceae). We also situated pollinator-mediated effects in a spatial context by linking variation in multiple paternity to variation in plant spatial isolation. We documented pronounced differences in the number of paternal sires as function of pollinator identity: on average, the primary pollinator (hawkmoths) facilitated mating with nearly twice as many pollen donors relative to the secondary pollinator (solitary bees). This effect was consistent for both isolated and nonisolated individuals, but spatial isolation imposed pronounced reductions on multiple paternity regardless of pollinator identity. Considering that pollinator abundance and pollen dispersal distance did not vary significantly with pollinator identity, we attribute variation in realized mating dynamics primarily to differences in pollinator morphology and behaviour as opposed to pollinator abundance or mating incompatibility arising from underlying spatial genetic structure. Our findings demonstrate that functionally distinct pollinators can have strongly divergent effects on polyandry in plants and further suggest that both pollinator identity and spatial heterogeneity have important roles in plant mating dynamics. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus

The European Bee-eater is an insectivorous, distinct hunter of large flying insects and in its Mediterranean habitats it largely prefers Hymenoptera. If the same food preference is also valid for Germany or if Bee-eaters here prefer different flight insects was investigated in three colonies in Rhineland-Palatinate. For this we analyzed prey offer and use. There was a significant difference between the composition of the food supply in the foraging areas and the eaten insects found in pellets of nestlings. In all three colonies about 90% of prey items belonged to Hymenoptera, although the portion of available Hymenoptera was 70% in one colony and between 10% and 20% the two other colonies. These results are in line with results from studies in Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and North Rhine-Westphalia as well as with several studies from East- And South Europe. All of these studies confirm the preference of Hymenoptera and the avoidance of Diptera. By comparing our results with those from literature, we could also demonstrate that the apparent level of preference depends also on methods: 1he Hymenoptera share was higher in pellets and by analyzing stomach contents than in photo documented nestling food.",Article,Scopus

Pollinators utilise different habitats to meet resource requirements throughout their life-span and it is widely accepted that their conservation requires a landscape-scale approach. Information on the mechanisms driving insect pollinators at the landscape scale is, however, lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, this novel study explores how pollinators utilise different habitats within a landscape and how utilisation changes over the season. Floral resources and insect pollinators (i.e. bumblebee, butterflies and hoverflies) were monitored during peak pollinator activity periods on a wide range of agricultural and semi-natural habitats in an intensive grassland landscape. The availability of key foraging resources differed between semi-natural habitats and this was strongly linked to their utilisation by pollinators. Floral resources were most abundant and diverse in road verges, riparian buffer strips and open scrub. These were key habitats for butterflies, with road verges and buffer strips also being important for hoverflies and bumblebees. The relative value of semi-natural habitats in providing floral resources changed throughout the season. Pollinators appeared to respond to changes in key floral resources, dynamically using different semi-natural habitats to meet their requirements. Maintaining landscape heterogeneity and improving the quality of semi-natural habitats to ensure resource diversity and continuity is fundamental to pollinator conservation. Regionally targeting agri-environment spending could result in the simplification of agricultural landscapes with consequences on insect pollinators and biodiversity as a whole. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

One landscape feature of great potential usefulness in view-based navigation is the skyline, the silhouette of terrestrial objects against the sky, as it is distant, relatively stable and easy to detect. The skyline has been shown to be important in the view-based navigation of ants, but no flying insect has yet been shown definitively to use the skyline in this way. Here, we show that honeybees do indeed orient using the skyline. A feeder was surrounded with an artificial replica of the natural skyline there, and the bees' departures toward the nest were recorded from above with a video camera under overcast skies (to eliminate celestial cues). When the artificial skyline was rotated, the bees' departures were rotated correspondingly, showing that the bees oriented by the artificial skyline alone. We discuss these findings in the context of the likely importance of the skyline in long-range homing in bees, the likely importance of altitude in using the skyline, the likely role of ultraviolet light in detecting the skyline, and what we know about the bees' ability to resolve skyline features. © 2017.

Because of its exponential diffusion and its serious threat to the local honey bee colonies and to humans as well, restraint measures are under investigation. Among them, the harmonic radar described in (Ecology and Evolution, 6, 2016 and 2170) already proved to be a quite effective way to follow the hornets to their nests; it is in fact capable of tracking the flying trajectory of these insects, once equipped with a small transponder, in their natural environment. The aforementioned harmonic radar was upgraded after a period of intense experimentation; the capture of the hornets was enhanced as well, and other improvements were adopted in the mounting procedure of the transponder. Thanks to these upgrades, the flying capabilities of the hornets were not reduced and a huge collection of data was recorded. The main upgrade to the radar was the adoption of the vertical polarization of the radiated field, with the consequent redesign and manufacturing of the antennas and the different mounting of the transceiver on the insect. The installation of the radar on a telescopic tower drastically improved the maneuverability of the system and the capability to follow the insects’ preferential flying directions. Eventually, the system was able to produce much more continuous traces with a clear indication of the most probable position of the nest.

We carried out observations of floral biology, as well as on the frequency and behaviour of pollinators visiting flowers in a population of T. gardneriana in the Chaco vegetation of Brazil. We conducted experimental pollinations to determine the maternal fertility of female plants and whether they were pollen-limited, and we also conducted aerobiological experiments to provide evidence of how environmental factors influence atmospheric pollen dispersal.

We studied a dimorphic population located in the southern “Wienerwald”-region to obtain frequencies of inter- and intra-morph pollinator switches. Pollinia were marked using dye powder to observe pollen flow, i.e. the spatial distribution of pollen, pollen export and deposition (i.e. male and female reproductive success) as well as the transport distances from donator to receptor plants. For analysing the switching behaviour of pollinators, we labelled yellow- and purple-flowering individuals morph-specifically using two different dye colours. In our study system, yellow-flowering plants were dominant (70% in 2006; 67% in 2014). We labelled 582 pollinia from yellow- and 239 from purple-flowering individuals reflecting the yellow-dominance (71%). In total, 473 marked pollinia were exported, of which 72.3% originated from yellow flowers. We found that movements of pollinators from yellow to yellow (YY) flowers dominate (93 of all 155 deposits of labelled pollen) the four possible pollination events by far. Even given the dominance of yellow-flowering plants in our study population, only 70 respective events (out of 155) would have been expected, if switching behaviour was by chance. Therefore, the assumption that pollinators alternate randomly between colour morphs was not supported by our results. The longest pollen transport distance observed was 237m. Moreover, 135 manually conducted cross-pollinations on 47 individuals were evaluated: seed viability analyses indicated no differences between the four possible crosses.

We tested the hypothesis that tremble followers and waggle followers exhibit the same dance-following behavior. If correct, this could unify our understanding of dance following, provide insight into dance information transfer, and offer a way to identify the signal receivers of tremble dance information. Followers showed similar initial attraction to and tracking of dancers. However, waggle dancers were faster than tremble dancers, and follower-forward, -sideways, and - angular velocities were generally similar to the velocities of their respective dancers. Waggle dancers attracted followers from 1.3-fold greater distances away than tremble dancers. Both follower types were attracted to the lateral sides of dancers, but tremble followers were more attracted to the dancer's head, and waggle followers were more attracted to the dancer's abdomen. Tremble dancers engaged in 4-fold more brief food exchanges with their followers than waggle dancers. The behaviors of both follower types are therefore relatively conserved.

Persistence in fragmented landscapes depends on the maintenance of connectivity among populations, without which genetic diversity may decrease and lead to population declines. Bees are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of low genetic diversity so it is important to understand patterns of dispersal for native bees living in fragmented areas. I used population genetic techniques to characterize patterns of genetic diversity and dispersal for the orchid bee Euglossa imperialis within and among forest fragments in southern Costa Rica, in which the furthest two fragments were 226 km from one another. In addition, I compared results of population genetic analyses conducted with all bees sampled, and results from analyses conducted with a reduced dataset containing only one individual per full sibling family from each site. For both datasets genetic diversity was low within forest fragments, with expected heterozygosity averaging 0.28 for the full dataset and 0.29 for the dataset containing only one full sibling per site. I found no evidence that deforested areas restricted dispersal; pairwise estimates of genetic differentiation FST′ among forest fragments averaged 0.01 for the full dataset, and 0 for the dataset containing only one full sibling per site. Genetic distance among sites within forest fragments was significantly correlated to geographic distance for the full dataset, but there was no significant correlation for the dataset that contained only one individual from each full sibling family. This suggests that family structure can drive results of analyses of genetic structure, although reductions in sample sizes following removal of full siblings may have reduced power to detect genetic structure. Despite no evidence for restricted dispersal, the low genetic diversity found suggests that E. imperialis may be an important candidate for future conservation monitoring. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Article,Scopus

Unfortunately, the movements of bees are difficult to measure directly at ecologically relevant scales. A common strategy for quantifying the foraging ranges of social bees is to sample the genotypes of foragers across a landscape. Individual foragers can be assigned to colonies with polymorphic genetic markers, and the dispersion of siblings in space can be used to make inference about colony locations and foraging movements. Several previous studies have sampled sibling genotypes at discrete locations (for example, at regular points along a transect), rather than in continuous space. Restricting the collection of bees to discrete locations presents a number of considerations for sampling design and data analysis. In this paper, we develop a spatially-explicit, model-based framework for the simulation and estimation of foraging ranges. Using these tools, we simulated experiments to characterise the efficacy of different sampling strategies, and provide an example with actual data that demonstrates the advantages of our method over an approach based on regression. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Article,Scopus

To assess success in restoring not only biodiversity, but also functionality of communities, we should take into account the re-assembly of species trait composition across taxa. Attaining such functional restoration would depend on the landscape context, vegetation structure, and time since restoration. We assessed how trait composition of plant and pollinator (bee and hoverfly) communities differ between abandoned, restored (formerly abandoned) or continuously grazed (intact) semi-natural pastures. In restored pastures, we also explored trait composition in relation to landscape context, vegetation structure, and pasture management history. Abandoned pastures differed from intact and restored pastures in trait composition of plant communities, and as expected, had lower abundances of species with traits associated with grazing adaptations. Further, plant trait composition in restored pastures became increasingly similar to that in intact pastures with increasing time since restoration. On the contrary, the trait composition of pollinator communities in both abandoned and restored pastures remained similar to intact pastures. The trait composition for both bees and hoverflies was influenced by flower abundance and, for bees, by connectivity to other intact grasslands in the landscape. The divergent responses across organism groups appeared to be mainly related to the limited dispersal ability and long individual life span in plants, the high mobility of pollinators, and the dependency of semi-natural habitat for bees. Our results, encompassing restoration effects on trait composition for multiple taxa along a gradient in both time (time since restoration) and space (connectivity), reveal how interacting communities of plants and pollinators are shaped by different trait–environmental relationships.

Average bee head width significantly correlated with average nectar standing crop volume but did not significantly change throughout the day.

To evaluate the extent to which H. communis behaves as a generalist and would be able to adapt to novel North American environments, we compare the breadth of its climatic, floral, habitat, and nesting preferences between its native European range and sites where it was first discovered in southern Québec, Canada. Specifically, we calculate the paired difference index, which approximates species generalism, from a set of bipartite networks linking Hylaeus Fabricius, 1793 species to their respective floral hosts and habitats. Results indicate that H. communis is the most adaptable bee of the European Hylaeus fauna and will likely acclimate to its new environment, being a greater generalist than an already widely established exotic bee, H. hyalinatus Smith, 1842. In southern Québec, we find that, despite visiting a wide variety of flowering species, it exhibits a strong association with non-native plants and resides almost exclusively in urban settings. We hypothesise that H. communis will be able to spread widely throughout North America via multiple human-mediated but accidental dispersal events and by following the distribution of European weeds and horticultural plants. © Entomological Society of Canada 2017.",Article,Scopus

The rich angiosperm diversity stems from several factors including variations in geographical distribution and floral morphology, which tend to correlate with different pollinator preference in many taxa. Pollinator diversity varies among different regions, thus range shifts can play an important role in increasing divergence by predisposing clades to floral shifts. Antirrhineae is an ideal model to examine the effect of range shifts and pollination modes on diversification, because the tribe is distributed in the Old World and the New World with representatives exhibiting hummingbird pollination in the New World, and bee pollination in the Old World and the New World. Using ancestral reconstructions and phylogenetic modeling, this study investigated the effects of geographic distribution and pollination modes on the macroevolution of the tribe Antirrhineae. Our age-range correlation analysis showed young nodes had more range overlap than older nodes in the phylogeny, suggesting sympatric speciation as a contributing factor to the diversification of the tribe. We observed similar rates of diversification throughout time with no evident rate shifts within the tribe. Old World and New World lineages have similar speciation rates in Antirrhineae, and pollination mode did not have a significant effect on the diversification of the tribe. However, we found evidence for increased diversification rates through long-distance dispersal events, which occurred between the Old World and the New World four times throughout the evolutionary history of Antirrhineae. Therefore, we conclude that long-distance dispersal was a strong contributor to the diversity within Antirrhineae. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",Article,Scopus

An optical tracking system is designed based on the principle of stereo vision with high-precision and low cost. This system uses optical infrared LEDs that are installed on the surgical instrument as markers and a near-infrared filter is added in front of the Bumblebee2 stereo camera lens to eliminate the interference of ambient light. The algorithm based on the region growing method is designed and used for the marker's pixel coordinates' extraction. In this algorithm, the singular points are eliminated and the gray centroid method is applied to solve the pixel coordinate of the marker's center. Then, the marker's matching algorithm is adopted and three-dimensional coordinates' reconstruction is applied to derive the coordinates of the surgical instrument tip in the world coordinate system. In the simulation, the stability, accuracy, rotation tests, and the tracking angle and area range were carried out for a typical surgical instrument and the miniature surgical instrument. The simulation results show that the proposed optical tracking system has high accuracy and stability. It can meet the requirements of surgical navigation. © The Authors.

Maximizing their potential is likely to be of increasing importance to the human food supply. We explored the potential of waggle dance data to determine the spatial ecology of honey bees sited in a crop under commercial pollination. Over two springs, we video recorded and then decoded 834 waggle dances from colonies located in two apple and pear farms in Kent, U.K. We also obtained pollen samples from returning foragers and quantified the insects visiting apple and pear flowers. The vast majority (84%) of dances were for locations outside of the orchards in which our colonies were located. Accounting for the distance of orchards and oilseed rape fields from the study colonies, the amount of foraging per hectare in oilseed rape fields was greater than in orchards. The results of the present study indicate that maximizing the pollination services of managed honey bee colonies requires an landscape level approach that takes into account farm and foraging scale, as well as competing floral sources. The data also suggest that oilseed rape is a significant competitor to apple and pear flowers for honey bee visits. © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society",Article,Scopus

We tentatively identified them as E. coerulescens (Lepeletier de Saint Fargeau) because of the uncertainty surrounding the limits of this taxon and hypothesized that they were members of a persistent bee population, rather than long-distance transient vagrants. The goals of this paper are to clarify the identity of these specimens, assess the species limits of E. coerulescens, and to evaluate suitability of habitats in the USA for this adventive species. Herein, we revise the species in the coerulescens group using morphological features of both sexes and confirm that the specimens of Eufriesea from the USA are E. coerulescens. We recognize the following six species in the coerulescens group: E. coerulescens, E. micheneri Ayala & Engel, E. simillima (Moure & Michener), which is reinstated from synonym with E. coerulescens, and three new species from Mexico (E. barthelli Gonzalez & Griswold, sp. n., E. engeli Gonzalez & Griswold, sp. n., and E. oliveri Gonzalez & Griswold, sp. n.). To facilitate the identification of these taxa, we present a fully illustrated account of the species, comparative diagnoses, descriptions, and an updated key to all Mexican species of Eufriesea. Our analyses using species distribution modelling show an absence of suitable habitat for E. coerulescens in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico, thus favoring the long-distance dispersal hypothesis. The analyses also suggest high suitability of habitats across the Caribbean and some areas in Florida, as well as in other regions in Mexico and Central America.

Studies completed on the macro- and micro-contents from dung deposited in a mountain cave in Catalonia during the 1970–1980s, preceding the socio-economic changes in the area, was supplemented by the testimony of the last shepherd alive in the area. This information was also compared with evidence from aerial photographs of the area surrounding the cave taken in 1956 and 2009. Although taphonomic distortion of the dung shape precluded its assignment to its producers based on morphology, information from the organic remains reflects the agro-pastoral activities in the mountainous area of the Catalan coast. A lack of calcium phosphate and abundant phytolith and epidermal remains from wild species indicates that the dung was excreted by ovicaprines, who sheltered in the cave during spells of adverse weather. These indicators also signify that the animals fed only on natural vegetation. Insect remains in the dung include fragments of chafers, dung and ground beetles, bees and ants, and whilst the latter may have foraged in the cave, the others may have been accidentally ingested by herbivores. The nannofossils and diatoms found in the dung derive from tertiary crops 4 km away from the cave but within the range of the ovicaprine herd. The lack of cereal and vegetable remains in the dung is consistent with the ethnographic record that shepherds and farmers could not afford to supplement the herds’ diet with fodder crops or grain, a consequence of the low productivity of the local subsistence agriculture. This study further discusses the socio-economic impacts of the introduction of intensive farming, industrialisation and tourism in Catalonia during the latter part of the last century and how they are represented in the dung. © 2016, © Association for Environmental Archaeology 2016.",Article,Scopus

Honey bees can tolerate high levels of many of these toxic compounds, including the alkaloid nicotine, in their diet without incurring apparent fitness costs. Very little is known about the underlying detoxification processes mediating this tolerance. We examined the metabolic fate of nicotine in newly emerged worker bees using radiolabeled nicotine and LC-MS/MS analysis to determine the kinetic distribution profile of nicotine as well as the absence or presence and identity of any nicotine-derived metabolites. Nicotine metabolism was extensive; virtually no unmetabolised nicotine were recovered from the rectum. The major metabolite found was 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl) butanoic acid, the end product of 2′C-oxidation of nicotine. It is the first time that 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl) butanoic acid has been identified in an insect as a catabolite of nicotine. Lower levels of cotinine, cotinine N-oxide, 3′hydroxy-cotinine, nicotine N-oxide and norcotinine were also detected. Our results demonstrated that formation of 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl) butanoic acid is quantitatively the most significant pathway of nicotine metabolism in honey bees and that the rapid excretion of unmetabolised nicotine does not contribute significantly to nicotine tolerance in honey bees. In nicotine-tolerant insects that do not rely on the rapid excretion of nicotine like the Lepidoptera, it is possible that the 2′C-oxidation of nicotine is the conserved metabolic pathway instead of the generally assumed 5′C-oxidation pathway. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

Impacts on local plants are well documented; however effects on native pollinators have gained less attention. We examine these issues in habitat fragments of the endangered oak-savannah ecosystem in British Columbia, Canada. We measured pollen collection by native bumble bees (Bombus Latreille; Hymenoptera: Apidae) and the introduced honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus; Hymenoptera: Apidae) foraging on two common native plants in habitat fragments with varying invasive (Cytisus scoparius (Linnaeus) Link; Fabaceae) density. The Bombus species with the largest workers had higher proportions of invasive pollen on their bodies and in their corbiculae than smaller workers. Honey bees rarely collected C. scoparius pollen. While some native bumble bees species collect an increasing proportion of C. scoparius pollen with increasing C. scoparius density, this did not translate into an increased potential for pollination. Rather, measures of effective pollination decline with C. scoparius density. Overall, our results suggest that some bee species may be better at finding resources at highly invaded sites. Apis mellifera is likely not playing a major role in facilitating the spread of C. scoparius in our region. Rather C. scoparius is visited by a complement of native bumble bees that are similar to pollinators in the native range of this plant. © 2017 Entomological Society of Canada.",Article,Scopus

A major cause of this decline is habitat loss due to agricultural intensification. A range of global and national initiatives aimed at restoring pollinator habitats and populations have been developed. However, the success of these initiatives depends critically upon understanding how landscape change affects key population-level parameters, such as survival between lifecycle stages, in target species. This knowledge is lacking for bumblebees, because of the difficulty of systematically finding and monitoring colonies in the wild. We used a combination of habitat manipulation, land-use and habitat surveys, molecular genetics and demographic and spatial modelling to analyse between-year survival of family lineages in field populations of three bumblebee species. Here we show that the survival of family lineages from the summer worker to the spring queen stage in the following year increases significantly with the proportion of high-value foraging habitat, including spring floral resources, within 250-1,000 m of the natal colony. This provides evidence for a positive impact of habitat quality on survival and persistence between successive colony cycle stages in bumblebee populations.

Using microsatellite markers, we assessed historical gene flow by the quantification of regional-scale genetic structure and isolation by distance among 18 populations, and contemporary gene flow by the estimation of recent migration rates among populations. To assess bee-mediated pollen dispersal on a smaller scale, we conducted paternity analyses within a focal population, and quantified within-population spatial genetic structure in four populations. Gene flow was limited to certain nearby populations within continuous forest blocks, whereas drift appeared to dominate on larger scales. Limited long-distance gene flow was supported by within-population patterns; gene flow was biased towards nearby plants, and significant small-scale spatial genetic structure was detected within populations. These findings suggest that, although female euglossine bees might be effective at moving pollen within populations, and perhaps within forest blocks, their contribution to gene flow on the regional scale seems too limited to counteract genetic drift in patchily distributed tropical plants.

We describe a novel pollinator model predicting flower visitation rates by wild central-place foragers (e.g., nesting bees) in spatially explicit landscapes. The model goes beyond existing approaches by: (1) integrating preferential use of more rewarding floral and nesting resources; (2) considering population growth over time; (3) allowing different dispersal distances for workers and reproductives; (4) providing visitation rates for use in crop pollination models. We use the model to estimate the effect of establishing grassy field margins offering nesting resources and a low quantity of flower resources, and/or late-flowering flower strips offering no nesting resources but abundant flowers, on bumble bee populations and visitation rates to flowers in landscapes that differ in amounts of linear seminatural habitats and early mass-flowering crops. Flower strips were three times more effective in increasing pollinator populations and visitation rates than field margins, and this effect increased over time. Late-blooming flower strips increased early-season visitation rates, but decreased visitation rates in other late-season flowers. Increases in population size over time in response to flower strips and amounts of linear seminatural habitats reduced this apparent competition for pollinators. Our spatially explicit, process-based model generates emergent patterns reflecting empirical observations, such that adding flower resources may have contrasting short- and long-term effects due to apparent competition for pollinators and pollinator population size increase. It allows exploring these effects and comparing effect sizes in ways not possible with other existing models.

Here, we use an SNP-based assay using the plant DNA barcoding locus matK to characterize pollen carriage between cultivated Brassica napus and wild Brassica rapa in three sites across southern England. The assay differentiated B. napus and B. rapa pollen carried by honey bees (Apis melifera), bumblebees (Bombus spp.), mining bees (Andrena spp.) and hoverflies (Syrphidae) captured on B. napus plants 1–2 m from wild B. rapa, and on B. rapa plants at various distances from the crop. Apis individuals foraging on B. rapa and carrying B. napus pollen were rarely found beyond 10 m from the crop. However, Bombus and Andrena individuals captured on B. rapa occasionally carried crop pollen up to 300 m from the source field. Hoverflies carried less pollen overall but featured high proportions of B. napus pollen even at the most distant capture points. We predict that different pollinator species will evoke markedly different patterns of interspecific hybrid formation. We conclude that more exhaustive surveys of this kind will help parameterize future mechanistic models to predict the distribution of hybrids between Genetically Modified B. napus and B. rapa on a landscape scale. © 2017 Gesellschaft für Ökologie",Article,Scopus

These declines may have significant ecological consequences, because bumblebees pollinate a large range of plant species. Our study was carried out in heathlands, open semi-natural habitats that have decreased considerably due to human activities. We analysed how floral resources affect bumblebee communities throughout the colony lifetime at three scales: plot scale, heathland patch scale, and landscape scale. Floral density at the plot scale and spruce plantations at the landscape scale influenced bumblebee communities. The abundance of bumblebees on ericaceous species was higher when the landscape included a substantial proportion of unsuitable foraging habitat (i.e., spruce plantations). Both life history traits and colony life cycle stage influenced bumblebee responses to the availability of floral resources. Bumblebees were more affected by floral resources during the colony development phase than during the nest-foundation or mating phases. Moreover, bumblebees of species that form large colonies needed larger quantities of favourable foraging habitat, compared with small-colony bees, and their proportion decreased in habitats dominated by spruce plantations. In conclusion, the conservation of plant–bumblebee interactions will require management at a larger spatial scale than the restricted protected habitats. Moreover, at the landscape scale, both quantity of favourable foraging patches and their ecological continuity are important to conserve both small- and large- colony species. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Article,Scopus

The current study aimed to estimate the diversity and population size of euglossine bees using short-term surveys and the mark–recapture method. We also compared short-term surveys with monthly surveys over a 1-year period (long-term surveys) to assess the species diversity. The study occurred in seven forest formations of the Brazilian savanna. We collected 14 species and marked 375 males but recaptured only 23 (6.1%).

The diversity indices achieved through the short-term surveys were similar to or higher than those obtained from long-term studies. The low recapture rate of euglossine males seems to be the result of their long-distance dispersal capacity.

There was a close correspondence between the phenology of flowering and the detection of plants within the honey. Within the study area there were 437 genera of plants in flower during April and May, but only 11% of these were used. Thirty-nine plant taxa were recorded from three hives but only ten at greater than 1%. All three colonies used the same core set of native or near-native plants, typically found in hedgerows and woodlands. The major plants were supplemented with a range of horticultural species, with more variation in plant choice between the honey bee colonies.

However, our understanding of the flow conditions that animals experience outdoors and how these impact flight performance remains limited. Here, we combine laboratory and field experiments to characterize wind conditions encountered by foraging bumblebees in outdoor environments and test the effects of these conditions on flight. We used radio-frequency tags to track foraging activity of uniquely identified bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) workers, while simultaneously recording local wind flows. Despite being subjected to a wide range of speeds and turbulence intensities, we find that bees do not avoid foraging in windy conditions. We then examined the impacts of turbulence on bumblebee flight in a wind tunnel. Rolling instabilities increased in turbulence, but only at higher wind speeds. Bees displayed higher mean wingbeat frequency and stroke amplitude in these conditions, aswell as increased asymmetry in stroke amplitude— suggesting that bees employ an array of active responses to enable flight in turbulence, which may increase the energetic cost of flight. Our results provide the first direct evidence that moderate, environmentally relevant turbulence affects insect flight performance, and suggest that flying insects use diverse mechanisms to cope with these instabilities. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Thus, there is increasing interest in their use as managed pollinators in regions where they occur naturally, including Australia. Here, we use a mark and release method to estimate the homing range of the most commonly propagated species of Australian stingless bee, Tetragonula carbonaria (Smith), where homing range serves as a proxy for foraging flight range.

Concerns at these declines have led to the development of flower-rich agri-environment schemes as a way to enhance bee diversity and abundance. Whilst the effect of these schemes on bumblebee species (Bombus spp.) has been well studied, their impact on the wider bee community is poorly understood. We used direct observations of foraging bees and pollen load analysis to quantify the relative contribution that sown flowers (i.e. those included in agri-environment scheme seed mixes) make to the pollen diets of wild solitary bees on Higher Level Stewardship farms (HLS) implementing pollinator-focused schemes and on Entry Level Stewardship farms (ELS) without such schemes in southern England, UK. HLS management significantly increased floral abundance, and as the abundance of sown flowers increased, these sown plants were utilized for pollen by a greater proportion of the solitary bee species present. However, the overall proportion of pollen collected from sown plants was low for both direct observations (27·0%) and pollen load analysis (23·3%). At most only 25 of the 72 observed species of solitary bee (34·7%) were recorded utilizing sown plants to a meaningful degree. The majority of solitary bee species did not collect pollen from flower species sown for pollinators. Total bee species richness was significantly associated with plant species richness, but there was no difference in the total species richness of either bee or flowering plant species between HLS and ELS farms. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that the majority of solitary bee species present on farmland in the south-east of England collect most of their pollen from plants that persist unaided in the wider environment, and not from those included in agri-environment schemes focused on pollinators. If diverse bee communities are to be maintained on farmland, existing schemes should contain an increased number of flowering plant species and additional schemes that increase the diversity of flowering plants in complementary habitats should be studied and trialled. © 2016 The Authors.

But it has not been clear if observed benefits of floral enhancements result from greater population growth, which is critical for the long-term success of conservation, or from mobile foragers aggregating in high-resource locations. Experimental evidence is only beginning to emerge in favor of the former mechanism and it is not well-established how different aspects of floral resources affect population growth. For example, bumble bee colonies may benefit from greater overall floral abundance, richness, or relative dominance of resource species. Because bumble bees are highly mobile, resource variability in the surrounding landscape is also important for colonies and may mediate local-scale effects. We experimentally assessed the growth and reproduction of bumble bee colonies (Bombus impatiens) deployed in grasslands in different local- and landscape-scale resource environments. We found that floral dominance, rather than the overall abundance or richness of floral resources, was the most important local factor for colony growth and reproduction. This may reflect more efficient foraging on a few numerically dominant and abundant resource species. Local- and landscape-scale predictor variables had interacting effects on colony growth and reproduction, suggesting that foraging distance depends on where in the landscape efficiently used resources are located. Our results provide further evidence that conservation strategies aimed at enhancing floral resources can increase bumble bee population growth. However, the most effective form of floral enhancement may vary among bee species. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

It has since spread very rapidly and has caused significant mortality among honeybees and native entomofauna. It also poses a risk to humans because its sting provokes allergic reactions. The objectives of this study were the following: (i) to disentangle the roles played by human-mediated dispersal and self-mediated dispersal in the species' rapid range expansion and (ii) to estimate the intensity of control measures in France and determine what needs to be done to slow the hornet's spread and dramatically reduce its population densities. A mathematical model was developed to describe the hornet's potential spread. This model included parameters describing the population growth rate, carrying capacity, self-mediated dispersal, human-mediated dispersal and the efficacy of control measures (i.e. the destruction of detected nests). Model parameters were estimated using 2004–2009 occurrence data for France and the model was then validated using 2013 occurrence data. Several scenarios were tested: human-mediated dispersal was present or absent and control intensity varied. Then, the species' spread in coming years was simulated (from 2013 to 2020). Despite some uncertainty on the value of the parameters, this model is relatively robust. Human-mediated dispersal may not be necessarily responsible for the hornet's rapid range expansion; the species could spread rapidly on its own. It is likely that to date, an average of 30–40% of detected nests have been destroyed each year. Increasing the percentage of destroyed nests from 30 to 60% could reduce the species' spread by 17% and its nest density by 29%. If 95% of nests are destroyed, the species' spread and nest density could decline by 43% and 53%, respectively. Synthesis and applications. The mathematical model developed in this study shows that human-mediated dispersal of the invasive yellow-legged hornet may not be the only factor explaining the hornet's rapid range expansion and that controlling this invasive pest is still possible. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reduce self-mediated dispersal and to intensify and improve control measures to diminish the species' impact and prevent its further spread. Control measures could combine the mechanical removal and destruction of individuals or infested materials with biological control techniques. © 2016 The Authors.

In this paper, I outline a time-efficient procedure to collect data on flower-visiting animals. The objectives were, first, to model diel activity rhythms by using cosine-based mixed-effects regression models (cosinor method) on data from an established automatic video monitoring system and, secondly, to test the use of a cheap off-the-shelf digital camera modified for automated monitoring of flower visitors. Two different model systems were studied: foraging bumblebees visiting focal white clovers, monitored around-the-clock (193 h) to model diel activity; and honeybees visiting thistles, monitored over a shorter period (5 h) to test the applicability and reliability of a new method for monitoring pollinators. The data were automatically entered and processed using R-scripts after manual filtering of the images, obviating the need for manual data entry prior to analysis. For diel activity in bumblebees, the model that gave the best fit included the 24-h fundamental period and one harmonic, a 12-h period to modulate the signal, together with temperature. The bumblebees were exclusive diurnal, with activity starting about 5 h after sunrise, peaking sharply in the afternoon and ending about 1 h before sunset. In addition to time of day, activity also increased with temperature. The off-the-shelf digital camera, Canon PowerShot®, with motion detection script, was triggered by every flower-visiting honeybee. In addition to recorded visitor frequency and visitor duration, it enabled high-resolution images, which could be important for species identification. Automatic camera recording is advantageous for close-up monitoring, compared with continuous video recording, because the latter demands more time and effort in reviewing the material. It could be used to study a range of different species such as pollinators, on-plant behaviour of herbivorous animals, cavity dwellers or cavity breeders. Moreover, the procedures for automatic data entry, data processing and statistical analysis for modelling diel activity rhythms could have great relevance for researchers using other types of camera monitoring systems operating 24 h per day. © 2016 The Author.

The diversity of understory honey plants determines visitation rate of pollinators such as honey bee (Apis mellifera) as they provide rich food resources. Since the flower visitation and foraging activity of pollinators lead to the provision of pollination service, it also means the enhancement of plant-pollinator relationship. Therefore, an appropriate management scheme for understory vegetation is essential in order to conserve pollinator population that is decreasing due to habitat destruction and disease infection. This research examined the diversity of understory honey plant and studied how it is related to environmental variables such as (1) canopy density, (2) horizontal heterogeneity of canopy surface height, (3) slope gradient, and (4) distance from roads. Vegetation survey data of 39 plots of mixed forests in Chuncheon, Korea, were used, and possible management practices for understory vegetation were suggested. Results: This study found that 113 species among 141 species of honey plant of the forests were classified as understory vegetation. Also, the understory honey plant diversity is significantly positively correlated with distance from the nearest road and horizontal heterogeneity of canopy surface height and negatively correlated with canopy density. Conclusions: The diversity of understory honey plant vegetation is correlated to vegetation structure and human impact. In order to enhance the diversity of understory honey plant, management of density and height of canopy is necessary. This study suggests that improved diversity of canopy cover through thinning of overstory vegetation can increase the diversity of understory honey plant species. © The Author(s). 2017.",Article,Scopus

Agent based models (ABM) allow us to model individuals that may quite simple in themselves, but who interact in ways that produce coherent behaviours at scale. Animal communication is a key example of a behaviour pattern that can only be understood as a group phenomonon. In this study we model the famous waggle dance of the honeybee. The software platform Netlogo is used to see how helpful it can be to biologists who may not be expert in computer science. Bees are modeled as finite-state machines, and there can be hundreds of them in the colony. They leave the hive to search for food sources (flowers) and return to communicate their direction and distance to other bees. In order to check the value of the waggle dance, it can be turned on or off in the artificial bee population. We find that the communication is indeed valuable to helping the bees locate food more quickly, and especially when it is not plentiful. We find that the component of direction is more useful to the bees than distance, although honeybees use both in real life.

For crops that are bee-pollinated, model predictions of outcrossing rates depend on the movement hypothesis used for the pollinators. Previous work studying pollen spread by honeybees, the most important pollinator worldwide, was based on the assumption that honeybee movement can be well approximated by Brownian motion. A number of recent studies, however, suggest that pollinating insects such as bees perform Lévy flights in their search for food. Such flight patterns yield much larger rates of spread, and so the Brownian motion assumption might significantly underestimate the risk associated with GM pollen outcrossing in conventional crops. In this work, we propose a mechanistic model for pollen dispersal in which the bees performtruncated Lévy flights. This assumption leads to a fractional- order diffusion model for pollen that can be tuned to model motion ranging from pure Brownian to pure Lévy. We parametrize our new model by taking the samepollen dispersal dataset used in Brownianmotionmodelling studies. By numerically solving themodel equations,we showthat the isolation distances required to keep outcrossing levels belowa certain threshold are substantially increased by comparison with the original predictions, suggesting that isolation distances may need to be much larger than originally thought. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The study aimed to investigate the intensity of heavy metal contents at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 km from the cement factory by determining, quantifying and measuring certain heavy metal contents in honey, bee collected-pollen and forager bee samples from the hybrid Carniolan honey bee, Apis mellifera carnica Pollmann colonies. Values of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) in honey, bee pollen and forager bees were variable and significantly dependent on the distance from the cement factory. The largest values of tested heavy metals were obtained from samples collected from the 1st location (3 km), except for Cu in honey, and Cu and Ni in forager bees collected from the 2nd location (6 km). In addition, these values were variable and significantly dependent on the type of product. The largest values of Mn, Zn and Cu were obtained from forager bees, while the maximum values of Fe and Ni were found in bee-pollen. On the other hand, harmful elements including lead (Pb), cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) were not detected in any of the samples. From results obtained in this study, it can be concluded that heavy metal pollution was most intense in zones closest to the cement-industry area. Finally, honey bees and their products can be used as an indicator of environmental pollution. © 2017 Kansas Entomological Society.",Article,Scopus

Once established, random fluctuations in birth and death rates may reduce the diversity of ecologically equivalent species if local populations are not replenished by immigrating individuals. Consequently, three key processes drive community assembly: dispersal limitation, ecological filtering, and ecological drift. However, disentangling the relative contribution of these processes remains a challenge in community ecology. We used a binomial generalized linear mixed model to test whether the occurrences of solitary bees within 46 communities in southeast Norway were driven by (1) dispersal limitation, that is, the geographic distance to the nearest site where conspecifics occurred; (2) ecological filtering, that is, if forb species richness selected for non-Ericaceae-affiliated species; and (3) ecological drift, that is, if small, isolated communities were dominated by regionally common species. The regression slopes from the model for each potential driver of community composition were compared with those expected under a null model, in which species were treated as ecologically equivalent. Both dispersal limitation and ecological filtering influenced the probability of species occurring within communities. The occurrence of species decreased with elevation, and this relationship depended on the relative commonness of species and their floral preferences. For non-Ericaceae-affiliated species, the patterns of occurrence mirrored that expected under the null (neutral) model, resulting in the same patterns as would be expected under ecological drift. In contrast, the response of Ericaceae-affiliated species differed from what would be expected from the null model. Our results also indicate that processes leading to neutral dynamics in species compositions drive a large part of the gradient in species richness in Norwegian bee communities. These processes seem related to sampling effects so that large and interconnected communities have a higher probability of including regionally rare species than small, isolated communities. Our results suggest that targeting habitats-where the influence of ecological filtering is expected to be greater than that of neutral dynamics-can increase the success of habitat management plans aimed at promoting rare species. © 2017 Sydenham et al.",Article,Scopus

The level of heavy metal pollution in the Trieste city was monitored using foraging bees of Apis mellifera ligustica from hives owned by beekeepers in two sites strategically located in the suburban industrial area and urban ones chosen as control. The metal concentration in foraging bees was determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The chemical analysis has identified and quantified 11 trace elements accumulated in two different rank orders: Zn> Cu > Sr > Bi > Ni > Cr > Pb = Co > V > Cd > As in foraging bees from the suburban site and Zn > Cu > Sr > Cr > Ni > Bi > Co = V > Pb > As > Cd in bees from urban site. Data revealed concentrations of Cr and Cu significantly higher and concentration of Cd significantly lower in bees from urban sites. The spatial difference and magnitude order in heavy metal accumulation along the urban-suburban gradient are mainly related to the different anthropogenic activity within sampled sites and represent a risk for the human health of people living in the city.

However, the popular conventional clustering algorithms have shortcomings such as dependency on center initialization, slow convergence rate, local optima trap, etc. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is one of the popular swarm based algorithm inspired by intelligent foraging behaviour of honeybees that helps to minimize these shortcomings.

The high genetic differentiation among populations of Encholirium horridum L.B.Sm. indicates low gene flow for this species that occurs exclusively on granitic inselbergs in South-east Brazil. Here we describe reproductive and pollination attributes of this bromeliad assessing how they influence the current degree of genetic isolation among populations. The mating system, estimated using five microsatellites markers, indicated allogamy and low pollen pool structure. The breeding system assessed by hand-pollination treatments supported partial self-incompatibility combined with inbreeding depression. Flowers of E. horridum are bell-shaped with crepuscular/nocturnal anthesis, and high nectar production, suggesting chiropterophily. Its pollination system was actually generalist but bats and hummingbirds were more frequent than hawkmoths and crepuscular bees. The high local abundance and large floral display per individual plant contributed to short distance pattern of pollen movement by pollinators. At the intra-population level, this pollinator foraging pattern, with inbreeding depression, promotes low seed viability and individual variations on outcrossing rate. At the inter-population level, those features led to low gene flow. Overall, heterozygosity, maintained by self-incompatibility and inbreeding depression, and pollination by vertebrates described here for E. horridum are consistent with other attributes that are predicted for inselberg plants by the OCBIL theory, such as reduced dispersability and genetic isolation among populations. Those characteristics contribute to the isolation of E. horridum populations and heighten the importance of population-based conservation strategies for taxa that occur exclusively in those naturally fragmented inselbergs. © CSIRO 2017.",Article,Scopus

Strong disproof of yeast ubiquity comes from studies on yeasts associated with beetles, drosophilids, bees, and short-lived flowers. The current knowledge suggests that geographical barriers, insect vectors, and host plants are important factors determining distribution of yeasts in their natural habitats.

In northern regions oilseed rape belongs to the main forage crops that is mostly cultivated by means of intensive agriculture, including several pesticide treatments. However, in addition to the focal forage crops, pesticides from non-forage crops can spread to wild flowers around fields, and thus the residues in honey would reflect the whole range of pesticides used in the agricultural landscape. The aim of our study was to clarify which currently used pesticides are present in honey gathered from heterogeneous agricultural landscapes after the end of flowering of oilseed crops. Honey samples (N = 33) were collected from beehives of Estonia during 2013 and 2014, and analysed for residues of 47 currently used agricultural pesticides using the multiresidue method with HPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS and a single residue method for glyphosate, aminopyralid and clopyralid. Residues of eight different active ingredients with representatives from all three basic pesticide classes were determined. Although no correlation was detected between the cumulative amount of pesticide residues and percent of oilseed crops in the foraging territory, most of the residues are those allowed for oilseed rape treatments. Among all pesticides, herbicide residues prevailed in 2013 but not in 2014. Despite the relatively small agricultural impact of Estonia, the detected levels of pesticide residues sometimes exceeded maximum residue level; however, these concentrations do not pose a health risk to consumers, also acute toxicity to honey bees would be very unlikely. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

Studies of its biological and ecological properties in the context of the breeding system of various populations may help to understand the evolutionary mechanism of this process. We investigated some aspects of the breeding system, diversity and foraging behavior of the visitors, and relationship between population properties and fruit set in three populations from NE Poland. We found distinct compatibility systems in two studied populations and showed that if a population is self-compatible (SC), selfing is mediated by insects via geitonogamous pollen transfer. Despite the population properties (compatibility, visitor diversity and activity, population size, density, or floral display), P. caeruleum is not pollen limited and pollinators are highly important as a key factor determining the high reproductive success. Visitor assemblages (including key pollinators, bumblebees, and honey bees) and their foraging behavior on inflorescences vary between the populations, which may influence differences in the breeding system. The selfincompatible population was visited by a more diverse group of insects from Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Heteroptera, and Coeloptera, which may favor effective cross-pollen transfer, whereas the SC population was pollinated mainly by Apis mellifera, which may promote mixed-mating.

Differences in dispersion capacity, which is greater in B. morio, likely influence their phylogeographic patterns. This study asks which processes best explain the patterns of genetic variation observed in B. morio and B. pauloensis, shedding light on the phenomena that shaped the range of local populations and the spatial distribution of intra-specific lineages. Results: Results suggest that Pleistocene climatic oscillations directly influenced the population structure of both species. Correlative species distribution models predict that the warmer conditions of the Last Interglacial contributed to population contraction, while demographic expansion happened during the Last Glacial Maximum. These results are consistent with physiological data suggesting that bumblebees are well adapted to colder conditions. Intra-specific mitochondrial genealogies are not congruent between the two species, which may be explained by their documented differences in dispersal ability. Conclusions: While populations of the high-dispersal B. morio are morphologically and genetically homogeneous across the species range, B. pauloensis encompasses multiple (three) mitochondrial lineages, and show clear genetic, geographic, and morphological differences. Because the lineages of B. pauloensis are currently exposed to distinct climatic conditions (and elevations), parapatric diversification may occur within this taxon.

Although many plausible drivers have been hypothesized, the cause(s) of this phenomenon remain debated. Here, genetic diversity in recent versus historical populations of bumblebee species was investigated by selecting four currently restricted and four currently widespread species. Specimens from five locations in Belgium were genotyped at 16 microsatellite loci, comparing historical specimens (1913-1915) with recent ones (2013-2015). Surprisingly, our results showed temporal stability of genetic diversity in the restricted species. Furthermore, both historical and recent populations of restricted species showed a significantly lower genetic diversity than found in populations of co-occurring widespread species. The difference in genetic diversity between species was thus already present before the alleged recent drivers of bumblebee decline could have acted (from the 1950's). These results suggest that the alleged drivers are not directly linked with the genetic variation of currently declining bumblebee populations. A future sampling in the entire distribution range of these species will infer if the observed link between low genetic diversity and population distribution on the Belgium scale correlates with species decline on a global scale. © The Author(s) 2016.",Article,Scopus

Most named taxa in this group (24 available names, from a total of 49 published names) were described originally from small differences in the colour pattern of the hair, many as parts (e.g. subspecies) of just one species. Subsequent taxonomic treatments recognised multiple species, but have described very few morphological characters, most of which are in the male genitalia. We examined 4413 specimens representing all of the named taxa from throughout the group's global range to describe variation in DNA, in skeletal morphology, and in the colour patterns of the hair. Using Bayesian inference of the phylogeny from an evolutionary model for the fast-evolving COI gene, and fitting either general mixed Yule/coalescent models or Poisson tree process models, we identify COI gene coalescents, which are expected to characterise species as evolutionarily independent lineages. None of the conditions most likely to compromise this interpretation (biased sampling, paralogy, introgression, heteroplasmy, incomplete lineage sorting) appears to be a substantial problem in this case. In an integrative analysis, we show that colour patterns are often variable within these groups and do not diagnose the same groups as we recognise from genes; in contrast, the groups recognised from gene coalescents can also be diagnosed from differences we identify in morphology. We infer that the 12 groups with coalescents in the COI gene that are corroborated by morphology constitute species, whereas many of these species are polymorphic in colour pattern. Lectotypes are designated for 15 taxa in order to reduce uncertainty in the identity and application of the names. We provide new morphological keys and distribution maps for the species. Then we use four genes (fast-evolving mitochondrial COI and 16S; and slower nuclear PEPCK and opsin) to obtain an absolute chronogram of phylogenetic relationships among the species. From published estimates that the most recent common ancestor of the subgenus Mendacibombus diverged from the other bumblebees at the beginning of the Oligocene, our results support the crown group of Mendacibombus as having diversified in the late Miocene, events that both appear to have been associated with periods of climate cooling. Relative conservatism in the alpine/subalpine climate niche of Mendacibombus, as compared with the much more diversified climate niches in the sister group of all other bumblebees, may have contributed to constraining the number of Mendacibombus species to just one twentieth of the total number of extant bumblebee species.

Bee diet breadth has been associated with sensitivity to agricultural intensification, but much of this analysis has been conducted at the categorical level of generalist or specialist, and it is not clear to what extent the level of generalisation within generalist species is also associated with species persistence. We used pollen load analysis to quantify the pollen diets of wild solitary bees on 19 farms across southern England, UK. A total of 72 species of solitary bees were recorded, but only 31 species were abundant enough to allow for formal diet characterisation. The results broadly conformed to existing literature with the majority of species polylectic and collecting pollen from a wide range of plants. Pollen load analysis consistently identified pollens from more plant species and families from each bee species than direct observation of their foraging behaviour. After rarefaction to standardise pollen load sample sizes, diet breadth was significantly associated with frequency of occurrence, with more generalist bees present on more farms than less generalist bees. Our results show that the majority of bee species present on farmland in reasonable numbers are widely variable in their pollen choices, but that those with the broadest diet were present on the greatest number of farms. Increasing the diversity of plants included in agri-environment schemes may be necessary to provide a wider range of pollen resources in order to support a diverse bee community on farmland. © 2016, The Author(s).",Article,Scopus

Depth information, from visual scale, or other modality such as laser ranging, can improve the quality of homing. While insects are not well equipped for stereovision, stereovision is an effective robot sensor. We describe the challenges involved in using stereovision derived depth in visual homing and our proposed solutions. Our algorithm, Homing with Stereovision (HSV), utilizes a stereo camera mounted on a pan-tilt unit to build composite wide-field stereo images and estimate distance and orientation from the robot to the goal location.

The effect of the resulting trait variation on pollination effectiveness at the level of different species has received considerable attention, while the effect of intra-specific trait variation at the population level is largely unexplored. We examined the impact of body size variation in the Red Mason bee Osmia rufa on the yield of oilseed rape in a caged field experiment. Crop yield was positively correlated to mean individual body size. Comparison with control plots showed that only large individuals increased yield to a level above pollinator-free variation. Small individuals, in contrast, even decreased yield compared to the variation within controls. Thus, the fitness of pollinator populations significantly affects pollination services, because adult body size is determined by the resource availability at the larval stage. Our results emphasize the need for complementing investigations on pollinator communities by analyses of the individual species involved. We conclude that only the availability of sufficient floral resources enables wild bee foragers to produce large, persistent offspring constituting effective pollinators for sustainable pollination services in the following season. © 2016 Gesellschaft für Ökologie",Article,Scopus

The model detects bees using background subtraction and colour thresholding, producing a binary image showing the bees as blobs. The blobs are then analysed to estimate the bees' positions, which are then used to track the bees in successive video frames. However, in the 50Hz video, bees move a significant distance from one frame to the next. Assuming that a bee's velocity is constant over three succesive frames, the bee position in the third frame can be predicted from the positions in the previous two frames. To track multiple bees in each frame, the predictions and detections are paired using the Hungarian method, which minimises the distances between the predicted positions and the actual detected positions. However, in 2D video, when several bees merge into one blob, it is hard to track the bees correctly when they separate in following frames. The bounding box information from the blob analysis is used to track bees when they separate after merging in the video image. Experiments indicate that single bee tracking is about 99% accurate while merged bee tracking is about 72% accurate. © 2015 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

We therefore developed a software tool, BEESCOUT, to theoretically examine how bees might explore a landscape and distribute their scouting activities over time and space. An image file can be imported, which is interpreted by the model as a “forage map” with certain colours representing certain crops or habitat types as specified by the user. BEESCOUT calculates the size and location of these potential food sources in that landscape relative to a bee colony. An individual-based model then determines the detection probabilities of the food patches by bees, based on parameter values gathered from the flight patterns of radar-tracked honeybees and bumblebees. Various “search modes” describe hypothetical search strategies for the long-range exploration of scouting bees. The resulting detection probabilities of forage patches can be used as input for the recently developed honeybee model BEEHAVE, to explore realistic scenarios of colony growth and death in response to different stressors. In example simulations, we find that detection probabilities for food sources close to the colony fit empirical data reasonably well. However, for food sources further away no empirical data are available to validate model output. The simulated detection probabilities depend largely on the bees’ search mode, and whether they exchange information about food source locations. Nevertheless, we show that landscape structure and connectivity of food sources can have a strong impact on the results. We believe that BEESCOUT is a valuable tool to better understand how landscape configurations and searching behaviour of bees affect detection probabilities of food sources. It can also guide the collection of relevant data and the design of experiments to close knowledge gaps, and provides a useful extension to the BEEHAVE honeybee model, enabling future users to explore how landscape structure and food availability affect the foraging decisions and patch visitation rates of the bees and, in consequence, to predict colony development and survival. © 2016",Article,Scopus

Their nest contains food stores in the form of honey and pollen, as well as the brood, the queen and the bees themselves. These resources have to be defended against a wide range of predators and parasites, a task that is performed by specialized workers, called guard bees. Guards tune their response to both the nature of the threat and the environmental conditions, in order to achieve an efficient trade-off between defence and loss of foraging workforce. By releasing alarm pheromones, they are able to recruit other bees to help them handle large predators. These chemicals trigger both rapid and longer-term changes in the behaviour of nearby bees, thus priming them for defence. Here, we review our current understanding on how this sequence of events is performed and regulated depending on a variety of factors that are both extrinsic and intrinsic to the colony.

Here, we tested whether the initial onset of an infection negatively impacts the flight behaviour of honey bee workers, which is an energetically demanding behaviour and a key component of foraging activities. To do this, we infected workers with the widespread fungal pathogen Nosema apis, which is recognised and killed by the honey bee immune system. We compared their survival and flight behaviour with non-infected individuals from the same cohort and colony using radio frequency identification tags (RFID). We found that over a time frame of four days post infection, Nosema did not increase mortality but workers quickly altered their flight behaviour and performed more flights of shorter duration.

Despite the ecological and economic importance of wild bees and the fact that several species are now managed for pollination services worldwide, little is known about how land use and beekeeping practices jointly influence gene flow. Using stingless bees as a model system, containing wild and managed species that are presumed to be particularly susceptible to habitat degradation, here we examine the main drivers of tropical bee gene flow. We employ a novel landscape genetic approach to analyse data from 135 populations of 17 stingless bee species distributed across diverse tropical biomes within the Americas. Our work has important methodological implications, as we illustrate how a maximum-likelihood approach can be applied in a meta-analysis framework to account for multiple factors, and weight estimates by sample size. In contrast to previously held beliefs, gene flow was not related to body size or deforestation, and isolation by geographic distance (IBD) was significantly affected by management, with managed species exhibiting a weaker IBD than wild ones. Our study thus reveals the critical importance of beekeeping practices in shaping the patterns of genetic differentiation across bee species. Additionally, our results show that many stingless bee species maintain high gene flow across heterogeneous landscapes. We suggest that future efforts to preserve wild tropical bees should focus on regulating beekeeping practices to maintain natural gene flow and enhancing pollinator-friendly habitats, prioritizing species showing a limited dispersal ability. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus

Due to these perceived concerns, the use of the three neonicotinoids imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam has been temporarily suspended in the European Union for seed treatment, soil application and foliar treatment in crops attractive to bees.

Adding honeybees suppressed bumblebee densities in field borders and road verges in homogeneous landscapes whereas no such effect was detected in heterogeneous landscapes. The proportional abundance of bumblebee species with small foraging ranges was lower at honeybee sites than at control sites in heterogeneous landscapes, whereas bumblebee communities in homogeneous landscapes were dominated by a single species with long foraging range irrespective of if honeybees were added or not.

Although causes of the declines remain unclear, environmental factors may be responsible. We focused on the potential environmental determinants of local populations of wild honeybees, Apis cerana japonica, in Japan. This subspecies has little genetic variation in terms of its mitochondrial DNA sequences, and genetic variations at nuclear loci are as yet unknown. We estimated the genetic structure and environmental determinants of local genetic diversity in nuclear microsatellite genotypes of fathers and mothers, inferred from workers collected at 139 sites. The genotypes of fathers and mothers showed weak isolation by distance and negligible genetic structure. The local genetic diversity was high in central Japan, decreasing toward the peripheries, and depended on the climate and land use characteristics of the sites. The local genetic diversity decreased as the annual precipitation increased, and increased as the proportion of urban and paddy field areas increased. Positive effects of natural forest area, which have also been observed in terms of forager abundance in farms, were not detected with respect to the local genetic diversity. The findings suggest that A. cerana japonica forms a single population connected by gene flow in its main distributional range, and that climate and landscape properties potentially affect its local genetic diversity. © 2016 Nagamitsu et al.

Little is known about what exactly is learned when an animal seeks to become familiar with the environment. Navigating animals explore the environment for safe return to an important place (e.g., a nest site) and to travel between places [4]. Flying central-place foragers like honeybees (Apis mellifera) extend their exploration into distances from which the features of the nest cannot be directly perceived [5–10]. Bees perform short-range and long-range orientations flights. Short-range flights are performed in the immediate surroundings of the hive and occur more frequently under unfavorable weather conditions, whereas long-range flights lead the bees into different sectors of the surrounding environment [11]. Applying harmonic radar technology for flight tracking, we address the question of whether bees learn landscape features during their first short-range or long-range orientation flight. The homing flights of single bees were compared after they were displaced to areas explored or not explored during the orientation flight. Bees learn the landscape features during the first orientation flight since they returned faster and along straighter flights from explored areas as compared to unexplored areas.

We first explored whether bumblebees can learn a nonnatural object manipulation task by using string pulling to access a reward that was presented out of reach. Only a small minority “innovated” and solved the task spontaneously, but most bees were able to learn to pull a string when trained in a stepwise manner. In addition, naïve bees learnt the task by observing a trained demonstrator from a distance. Learning the behavior relied on a combination of simple associative mechanisms and trial-and-error learning and did not require “insight”: naïve bees failed a “coiled-string experiment,” in which they did not receive instant visual feedback of the target moving closer when tugging on the string. In cultural diffusion experiments, the skill spread rapidly from a single knowledgeable individual to the majority of a colony’s foragers. We observed that there were several sequential sets (“generations”) of learners, so that previously naïve observers could first acquire the technique by interacting with skilled individuals and, subsequently, themselves become demonstrators for the next “generation” of learners, so that the longevity of the skill in the population could outlast the lives of informed foragers. This suggests that, so long as animals have a basic toolkit of associative and motor learning processes, the key ingredients for the cultural spread of unusual skills are already in place and do not require sophisticated cognition. © 2016 Alem et al.",Article,Scopus

Pesticide exposure may cause behavioural changes that interfere with these processes, with consequences for colony persistence and delivery of pollination services. We investigated the impact of chronic exposure (5–43 days) to field-realistic levels of a neonicotinoid insecticide (2·4 ppb thiamethoxam) on foraging ability, homing success and colony size using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in free-flying bumblebee colonies. Individual foragers from pesticide-exposed colonies carried out longer foraging bouts than untreated controls (68 vs. 55 min). Pesticide-exposed bees also brought back pollen less frequently than controls indicating reduced foraging performance. A higher proportion of bees from pesticide-exposed colonies returned when released 1 km from their nests; this is potentially related to increased orientation experience during longer foraging bouts.

Despite a trend for control colonies to produce more new workers earlier, we found no overall impacts of pesticide exposure on whole colony size. Synthesis and applications.

Limitations are expected both on acuity, and thus on the ability to detect objects from a distance, as well as on sensitivity, and thus on the foraging time window at dusk and dawn. In this study, we determined light intensity thresholds for flight under dim light conditions in eight stingless bee species in relation to body size in a Neotropical lowland rainforest.

Further, we measured eye size, ocelli diameter, ommatidia number, and facet diameter. All parameters significantly correlated with body size. A disproportionately low light intensity threshold in the minute Trigonisca pipioli, together with a large eye parameter Peye suggests specific adaptations to circumvent the optical constraints imposed by the small body size. We discuss the implications of body size in bees on foraging behavior. © 2016, The Author(s).",Article,Scopus

We examine here one of the largest bee genera, the genus Megachile – the dauber and leafcutting bees. Besides presenting a phylogeny based on five nuclear genes (5480 aligned nucleotide positions), we attempt to use the phylogenetic signal of mitochondrial DNA barcodes, which are rapidly accumulating and already include a substantial proportion of the known species diversity in the genus. We used barcodes in two ways: first, to identify particularly divergent lineages and thus to guide taxon sampling in our nuclear phylogeny; second, to augment taxon sampling by combining nuclear markers (as backbone for ancient divergences) with DNA barcodes. Our results indicate that DNA barcodes bear phylogenetic signal limited to very recent divergences (3–4 my before present). Sampling within clades of very closely related species may be augmented using this technique, but our results also suggest statistically supported, but incongruent placements of some taxa. However, the addition of one single nuclear gene (LW-rhodopsin) to the DNA barcode data was enough to recover meaningful placement with high clade support values for nodes up to 15 million years old. We discuss different proposals for the generic classification of the tribe Megachilini. Finding a classification that is both in agreement with our phylogenetic hypotheses and practical in terms of diagnosability is particularly challenging as our analyses recover several well-supported clades that include morphologically heterogeneous lineages. We favour a classification that recognizes seven morphologically well-delimited genera in Megachilini: Coelioxys, Gronoceras, Heriadopsis, Matangapis, Megachile, Noteriades and Radoszkowskiana. Our results also lead to the following classification changes: the groups known as Dinavis, Neglectella, Eurymella and Phaenosarus are reestablished as valid subgenera of the genus Megachile, while the subgenus Alocanthedon is placed in synonymy with M. (Callomegachile), the subgenera Parachalicodoma and Largella with M. (Pseudomegachile), Anodonteutricharaea with M. (Paracella), Platysta with M. (Eurymella), and Grosapis and Eumegachile with M. (Megachile) (new synonymies). In addition, we use maximum likelihood reconstructions of ancestral geographic ranges to infer the origin of the tribe and reconstruct the main dispersal routes explaining the current, cosmopolitan distribution of this genus. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus

Nectar is a resource that exists along a continuum of quality in terms of sugar concentration and is the primary energy source for bees. Alternative sugar sources exist, including fruit juice, which generally has lower energetic value than nectar. We observed many honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata) foraging on juice from fallen guava (Psidium guajava) fruit near others foraging on nectar. To investigate whether fruit and nectar offered contrasting benefits of quality and quantity, we compared honeybee foraging performance on P. guajava fruit versus two wildflowers growing within 50 m, Richardia brasiliensis and Tridax procumbens. Bees gained weight significantly faster on fruit, 2.72 mg/min, than on either flower (0.17 and 0.12 mg/min, respectively). However, the crop sugar concentration of fruit foragers was significantly lower than for either flower (12.4% vs. 37.0% and 22.7%, respectively). Fruit foragers also spent the most time handling and the least time flying, suggesting that fruit juice was energetically inexpensive to collect. We interpret honeybee foraging decisions in the context of existing foraging models and consider how nest-patch distance may be a key factor for central place foragers choosing between resources of contrasting quality and quantity. We also discuss how dilute solutions, such as fruit juice, can help maintain colony sugar–water balance. These results show the benefits of feeding on resources with contrasting quality and quantity and that even low-quality resources have value. © 2016 The Authors.

Bumblebees forage and land under a broad range of light intensities and while their behavior during the final moments of landing has been described in detail in bright light, little is known about how this is affected by decreasing light intensity. Here, we investigate this by characterizing the performance of bumblebees, B. terrestris, landing on a flat platform at two different orientations (horizontal and vertical) and at four different light intensities (ranging from 600 lx down to 19 lx). As light intensity decreased, the bees modified their body position and the distance at which they extended their legs, suggesting that the control of landing in these insects is visually mediated. Nevertheless, the effect of light intensity was small and the landings were still well controlled, even in the dimmest light. We suggest that the changes in landing behavior that occurred in dim light might represent adaptations that allow the bees to perform smooth landings across the broad range of light intensities at which they are active. © 2016 Reber, Dacke, Warrant and Baird.",Article,Scopus

However, knowledge of how the proteome controls MG development and functionality at the different physiological stages of worker bees is still lacking. We characterized and compared the proteome across different ages of MGs in Italian bees (ITBs) and Royal Jelly (RJ) bees (RJBs), the latter being a line bred for increasing RJ yield, originating from the ITB. All 2000 proteins that were shared by differently aged MGs in both bee lines (>4000 proteins identified in all) were strongly enriched in metabolizing protein, nucleic acid, small molecule, and lipid functional groups. The fact that these shared proteins are enriched in similar groups in both lines suggests that they are essential for basic cellular maintenance and MG functions. However, great differences were found when comparing the proteome across different MG phases in each line. In newly emerged bees (NEBs), the unique and highly abundant proteins were enriched in protein synthesis, cytoskeleton, and development related functional groups, suggesting their importance to initialize young MG development. In nurse bees (NBs), specific and highly abundant proteins were mainly enriched in substance transport and lipid synthesis, indicating their priority may be in priming high secretory activity in lipid synthesis as larval nutrition. The unique and highly abundant proteins in forager bees (FBs) were enriched in lipid metabolism, small molecule, and carbohydrate metabolism. This indicates their emphasis on 2-heptanone synthesis as an alarm pheromone to enhance colony defense or scent marker for foraging efficiency. Furthermore, a wide range of different biological processes was observed between ITBs and RJBs at different MG ages. Both bee stocks may adapt different proteome programs to drive gland development and functionality. The RJB nurse bee has reshaped its proteome by enhancing the rate of lipid synthesis and minimizing degradation to increase 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid synthesis, a major component of RJ, to maintain the desired proportion of lipids in increased RJ production. This study contributes a novel understanding of MG development and lipid metabolism, and a potential starting point for lipid or pheromone biochemists as well as developmental geneticists. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",Article,Scopus

However, it is unknown how increasing areas of mass-flowering crops like oilseed rape (Brassica napus; OSR) or a decrease of seminatural habitats (SNH) change the temporal and spatial availability of pollen resources for honey bee colonies, and thus foraging distances and firequency in different habitat types. We studied pollen foraging of honey bee colonies in 16 agricultural landscapes with independent gradients of OSR and SNH area within 2 km and used waggle dances and digital geographic maps with major land cover types to reveal the distance and visited habitat type on a landscape level. Mean pollen foraging distance of 1347 decoded bee dances was 1015 m (± 26 m; SEM). In spring, increasing area of flowering OSR within 2 km reduced mean pollen foraging distances from 1324 m to only 435 m. In summer, increasing cover of SNH areas close to the colonies (within 200 m radius) reduced mean pollen foraging distances from 846 to 469 m. Frequency of pollen foragers per habitat type, measured as the number of dances per hour and hectare, was equally high for SNH, grassland, and OSR fields, but lower for other crops and forests. In landscapes with a small proportion of SNH a significantly higher density of pollen foragers on SNH was observed, indicating that pollen resources in such simple agricultural landscapes are more limited. Overall, we conclude that SNH and mass-fowering crops can reduce foraging distances of honey bee colonies at different scales and seasons with possible benefits for the performance of honey bee colonies. Further, mixed agricultural landscapes with a high proportion of SNH reduce foraging densities of honey bees in SNH and thus possible competition for pollen resources. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus

There is compelling evidence that small species are more susceptible than large species. The impact of habitat fragmentation on intraspecific body-size distribution, however, is yet unexplored. Objectives: We tested habitat fragmentation, a major driver of pollinator loss, for its impact on intraspecific body-size distributions of solitary wild-bee species. Subsequently, we tested individual body size for its impact on pollination services. Methods: We sampled 1272 individuals of the four most common Andrena wild bee species in 22 newly established flowering fields (0.21–0.41 ha) in Hessen, Central Germany, over two consecutive years. Study sites were located in a ca. 80 ha landscape context of increasing habitat fragmentation. We analysed the pollen loads of the most abundant species. Results: Body size within local populations of the two medium-sized bees increased with fragmentation, suggesting intraspecific selection for higher dispersal capacity. Pollen analysis carried out for the most common species revealed that larger individuals visited a significantly smaller plant spectrum. Habitat fragmentation may thus alter pollination services without necessarily affecting species richness or composition. Conclusions: Systematic body-size variation at the population level thus explains the considerable variability between simple community measures and ecosystem functioning. Filtering processes at the individual level require increased understanding for targeting pollination services under current and future land-use change. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Article,Scopus

Individual honeybees trained to collect sucrose solution from four artificial flowers arranged within 10 m of the hive location developed repeatable visitation sequences both in the laboratory and in the field. A 10-fold increase of between-flower distances considerably intensified this routing behaviour, with bees establishing more stable and more efficient routes at larger spatial scales.

Virus infection induces changes in plant volatile emission profiles, and this can make plants more attractive to insect herbivores, such as aphids, that act as viral vectors. However, it is unknown if virus-induced alterations in volatile production affect plant-pollinator interactions. We found that volatiles emitted by cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-infected tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and Arabidopsis thaliana plants altered the foraging behaviour of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Virus-induced quantitative and qualitative changes in blends of volatile organic compounds emitted by tomato plants were identified by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. Experiments with a CMV mutant unable to express the 2b RNA silencing suppressor protein and with Arabidopsis silencing mutants implicate microRNAs in regulating emission of pollinator-perceivable volatiles. In tomato, CMV infection made plants emit volatiles attractive to bumblebees. Bumblebees pollinate tomato by ‘buzzing’ (sonicating) the flowers, which releases pollen and enhances self-fertilization and seed production as well as pollen export. Without buzz-pollination, CMV infection decreased seed yield, but when flowers of mock-inoculated and CMV-infected plants were buzz-pollinated, the increased seed yield for CMV-infected plants was similar to that for mock-inoculated plants. Increased pollinator preference can potentially increase plant reproductive success in two ways: i) as female parents, by increasing the probability that ovules are fertilized; ii) as male parents, by increasing pollen export. Mathematical modeling suggested that over a wide range of conditions in the wild, these increases to the number of offspring of infected susceptible plants resulting from increased pollinator preference could outweigh underlying strong selection pressures favoring pathogen resistance, allowing genes for disease susceptibility to persist in plant populations. We speculate that enhanced pollinator service for infected individuals in wild plant populations might provide mutual benefits to the virus and its susceptible hosts. © 2016 Groen et al.",Article,Scopus

Quantity of pollinator visits to a native may increase, decrease, or change nonlinearly, while visit quality is likely to decrease with greater interspecific pollen movement. How visit quantity and quality contribute to the effect on reproductive success at each invasion stage has not been measured. METHODS: We simulated four stages of invasion by Brassica nigra by manipulating the neighborhood of potted plants of the native Phacelia parryi in a field experiment. Stages were far from the invasion, near the invasion, intermixed with the invasive at low density, and intermixed at high density. We measured pollinator visitation, conspecific and invasive pollen deposition, and seed set for P. parryi at each stage. KEY RESULTS: Native individuals near invasive plants and within areas of low invasive density showed greatest seed production, as expected from concurrent changes in conspecific and invasive pollen deposition. Those plants experienced facilitation of visits and received more conspecific pollen relative to plants farther from invasives. Native individuals within high invasive density also received frequent visits by many pollinators (although not honeybees), but the larger receipt of invasive pollen predicted interference with pollen tubes that matched patterns in seed set. CONCLUSIONS: Pollinator visitation was highest when exotic plants were nearby. Detrimental effects of heterospecific pollen deposition were highest at high exotic density.

Pollen is the primary source of proteins and lipids for bees, and the concentrations of these nutrients in pollen can vary widely among host-plant species. Therefore we hypothesized that foraging decisions of bumble bees are driven by both the protein and lipid content of pollen. By successively reducing environmental and floral cues, we analyzed pollen-foraging preferences of Bombus impatiens in (i) host-plant species, (ii) pollen isolated from these host-plant species, and (iii) nutritionally modified single-source pollen diets encompassing a range of protein and lipid concentrations. In our semifield experiments, B. impatiens foragers exponentially increased their foraging rates of pollen from plant species with high protein: lipid (P:L) ratios; the most preferred plant species had the highest ratio (∼4.6:1). These preferences were confirmed in cage studies where, in pairwise comparisons in the absence of other floral cues, B. impatiens workers still preferred pollen with higher P:L ratios. Finally, when presented with nutritionally modified pollen, workers were most attracted to pollen with P:L ratios of 5:1 and 10:1, but increasing the protein or lipid concentration (while leaving ratios intact) reduced attraction. Thus, macronutritional ratios appear to be a primary factor driving bee pollen-foraging behavior and may explain observed patterns of host-plant visitation across the landscape. The nutritional quality of pollen resources should be taken into consideration when designing conservation habitats supporting bee populations. © 2016, National Academy of Sciences.

The knowledge of relatedness among the males attending the aggregations and the distance that they disperse from their natal nests to aggregations may provide important data to effectively conserve these bees. Here, we estimated these properties for Tetragonisca angustula (Latreille, 1811) males. Microsatellite molecular markers were used to genotype bees sampled from local nests and in mating swarms in order to identify the nests of origin of males and maternal genotypes of concerning queens. The distances from assigned nests to the mating swarms allowed us to estimate the distances travelled by males. A genetic relationship analysis was conducted to verify whether T. angustula males were closely related to nests where they aggregated. A pairwise relatedness analysis was also performed among all T. angustula males in each mating swarm. Our results demonstrated that T. angustula mating swarms received dozens to hundreds of males from several colonies (up to 70). Only two of the five mating swarms contained any males that were closely related to the bees from the new nests in construction. The relatedness among males was also extremely low. Yet, dispersal distance of T. angustula males ranged hundreds of meters up to 1.6 km, with evidence of reaching 2.25 km according to their flight radius obtained from their foraging area for locality. These data indicate a highly efficient mating system with minimal inbreeding in this bee species, with a great dispersal capability not previously found for stingless bee males. © 2016 The Entomological Society of Japan.",Article,Scopus

Thermal tolerance of diverse organisms often varies predictably with latitude, with upper thermal limits changing little and lower thermal limits decreasing with latitude. Despite similarly steep gradients in environmental temperatures across altitude, few studies have investigated altitudinal variation in critical thermal limits. We estimated critical thermal minimum (CTmin), critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and recovery temperature (Trec) by tracking righting response of three bumble bee species during thermal ramps: Bombus huntii collected from 2180 m asl, and Bombus bifarius and Bombus sylvicola collected from 3290 m asl in Wyoming, USA. Overall, larger bees could tolerate more extreme temperatures, likely due to a thermal inertia driven lag between core body temperatures and air temperatures. Despite their smaller size, high altitude bumble bees tolerated colder air temperatures: they had ~1 °C lower CTmin and recovered from cold exposure at ~3-4 °C lower air temperatures. Conversely, low altitude bees tolerated ~5 °C hotter air temperatures. These altitudinal differences in thermal tolerance parallel differences in average daily minimum (1.2 °C) and maximum (7.5 °C) temperatures between these sites. These results provide one of the few measurements of organism thermal tolerance across altitude and the first evidence for geographical differences in tolerance of temperature extremes in heterothermic bumble bees. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Several studies have examined the impact of forest proximity on plant pollination ecology, but concentrated on single crop species. However, it can be more informative to investigate multiple crop and pollinator species in a community, because different pollinator groups may respond differently to forest distance. We evaluated flower visitor diversity, visitation frequency, and fruit set for three crop species (rambutan, durian and mango) in 10 pairs of mixed fruit orchards. Each pair consisted of one orchard near to (< 1 km) and one orchard far from (> 7 km) the forest edge. Rambutan fruit set was significantly influenced by distance to forest. The main visitors of rambutan flowers were stingless bees. In contrast, the dominant visitors to durian and mango flowers were nectarivorous bats and flies, respectively, and the fruit set of these crops were not significantly influenced by distance to forest. However, durian fruit set was negatively affected by distance to the nearest cave inhabited by nectarivorous bats. This study demonstrates that both caves and forests can be important pollinator sources for agricultural crops, and that the dispersal success of pollinators is related to isolation from source habitats. Maintaining forest patches and limestone karsts may provide stepping stones across fragmented landscapes, and attract greater numbers of pollinators to agricultural areas. © 2016 Cambridge University Press.",Article,Scopus

Because polyploidy can induce an array of phenotypic changes, there can be cascading eff ects on interactions with other species. These interactions, in turn, can have reciprocal eff ects on polyploid plants, potentially impacting their establishment and persistence. Although there is a wealth of information on the genetic and phenotypic effects of polyploidy, the study of species interactions in polyploid plants remains a comparatively young fi eld. Here we reviewed the available evidence for how polyploidy may impact many types of species interactions that range from mutualism to antagonism. Specifi cally, we focused on three main questions: (1) Does polyploidy directly cause the formation of novel interactions not experienced by diploids, or does it create an opportunity for natural selection to then form novel interactions? (2) Does polyploidy cause consistent, predictable changes in species interactions vs. the evolution of idiosyncratic diff erences? (3) Does polyploidy lead to greater evolvability in species interactions? From the scarce evidence available, we found that novel interactions are rare but that polyploidy can induce changes in pollinator, herbivore, and pathogen interactions. Although further tests are needed, it is likely that selection following whole-genome duplication is important in all types of species interaction and that there are circumstances in which polyploidy can enhance the evolvability of interactions with other species. © 2016 Botanical Society of America.",Article,Scopus

The temporal polyethism schedule is sensitive to colony perturbations that may lead to adaptive changes in task allocation, maintaining colony homeostasis. Though social insects can be infected by a range of parasites, little is known of how these parasites impact within-colony behaviour and the temporal polyethism schedule. We use honey bees (Apis mellifera) experimentally infected by two of their emerging pathogens, Deformed wing virus (DWV), which is relatively understudied concerning its behavioural impact on its host, and the exotic microsporidian Nosema ceranae. We examined parasite effects on host temporal polyethism and patterns of activity within the colony. We found that pathogens accelerated the temporal polyethism schedule, but without reducing host behavioural repertoire. Infected hosts exhibited increased hyperactivity, allocating more time to self-grooming and foraging-related tasks. The strength of behavioural alterations we observed was found to be pathogen specific; behavioural modifications were more pronounced in virus-treated hosts versus N. ceranae-treated hosts, with potential benefits for the colony in terms of reducing within-colony transmission. Investigating the effects of multiple pathogens on behavioural patterns of social insects could play a crucial role in understanding pathogen spread within a colony and their effects on colony social organisation. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus

Consequences may range from reproductive competition to facilitation, but the ecological drivers determining the type and magnitude of such indirect interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the role of the spatial scale of invader presence and spatially contingent behavioural responses of different pollinator groups as potential key drivers, using the invasive Oxalis pes-caprae and the self-incompatible native annual Diplotaxis erucoides as a model system. Three treatments were assigned to native focal plants: (1) invader present at the landscape scale (hectares) but experimentally removed at the floral neighbourhood scale (pa); (2) invader present at both scales (pp); (3) invader absent at both scales (aa). Interestingly, we found pronounced spatially contingent differences in the responses of pollinators: honeybees and bumblebees were strongly attracted into invaded sites at the landscape scale, translating into native plant visitation facilitation through honeybees, while bumblebees almost exclusively visited Oxalis. Non-corbiculate wild bees, in contrast, showed less pronounced responses in foraging behavior, primarily at the floral neighborhood scale. Average heterospecific (Oxalis) pollen deposition onto stigmas of Diplotaxis was low (<1 %), but higher in the pp than in the pa treatment. Hand-pollination of Diplotaxis with Oxalis and conspecific pollen, however, reduced seed set by more than half when compared to hand-pollination with only conspecific pollen. Seed set of Diplotaxis, finally, was increased by 14 % (reproductive facilitation) in the pp treatment, while it was reduced by 27 % (reproductive competition) in the pa treatment compared to uninvaded populations.

In the remnant fragments of tropical dry forest in Mayotte (Comoros Archipelago, Indian Ocean), the clarification of the reproductive strategies of the orphan leafless Vanilla humblotii Rchb. f. will provide a better understanding of its fine-scale spatial genetic structure. Approaches combining reproductive biology and fine-scale spatial genetic structure analyses using ten microsatellite markers in 49 individuals sampled in the only remaining large population of V. humblotii were employed to unravel the reproductive strategies of this species. The results showed that V. humblotii displays unscented flowers and is allogamous and pollinator-dependent although also self-compatible.

A high genotypic diversity (G/N = 0.88) and a phalanx clonal growth are detected, and seed dispersal is higher than pollen dispersal. The phalanx distribution of the repeated genotypes (ramets arisen from the same genet) is responsible for significant autocorrelations detected at small distances.

Since so far the evidence for monocausal explanations is equivocal, involvement of multiple stressors is generally assumed. We here focus on various aspects of forage availability, which have received less attention than other stressors because it is virtually impossible to explore them empirically. We applied the colony model BEEHAVE, which links within-hive dynamics and foraging, to stylized landscape settings to explore how foraging distance, forage supply, and “forage gaps”, i.e. periods in which honeybees cannot find any nectar and pollen, affect colony resilience and the mechanisms behind. We found that colony extinction was mainly driven by foraging distance, but the timing of forage gaps had strongest effects on time to extinction. Sensitivity to forage gaps of 15 days was highest in June or July even if otherwise forage availability was sufficient to survive. Forage availability affected colonies via cascading effects on queen's egg-laying rate, reduction of new-emerging brood stages developing into adult workers, pollen debt, lack of workforce for nursing, and reduced foraging activity. Forage gaps in July led to reduction in egg-laying and increased mortality of brood stages at a time when the queen's seasonal egg-laying rate is at its maximum, leading to colony failure over time. Our results demonstrate that badly timed forage gaps interacting with poor overall forage supply reduce honeybee colony resilience. Existing regulation mechanisms which in principle enable colonies to cope with varying forage supply in a given landscape and year, such as a reduction in egg-laying, have only a certain capacity. Our results are hypothetical, as they are obtained from simplified landscape settings, but they are consistent with existing empirical knowledge. They offer ample opportunities for testing the predicted effects of forage stress in controlled experiments. © 2015 The Authors",Article,Scopus

By attaching altitude loggers to nesting Purple Martins and collecting prey delivered to their nestlings, we determined the flight altitudes of ants and other insects. We then tested hypotheses relating ant body size and reproductive ecology to flight altitude. Purple Martins flew up to 1,889 meters above ground, and nestling provisioning trips ranged up to 922 meters. Insect communities were structured by body size such that species of all sizes flew near the ground but only light insects flew to the highest altitudes. Ant maximum flight altitudes decreased by 60% from the lightest to the heaviest species. Winged sexuals of social insects (ants, honey bees, and termites) dominated the Purple Martin diet, making up 88% of prey individuals and 45% of prey biomass. By transferring energy from terrestrial to aerial food webs, mating swarms of social insects play a substantial role in aerial ecosystems.

This is particularly true for distance communication. Here, we trained individually marked bees from three colonies to forage at feeders of known distances and monitored their dances to determine individual communication variation. We found that each honey bee possesses her own calibration: individual duration-distance calibrations varied significantly in both slopes and intercepts. The variation may incur a cost for communication, such that a dancer and recruit may misunderstand the communicated distance by as much as 50%.

However, high honey bee densities may have an impact on local pollen and nectar availability, which in turn may negatively affect other pollinators. This is exacerbated by the ability of honey bees to recruit foragers to highly rewarding flower patches. We measured floral resource consumption in rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris) in 21 plots located at different distances from apiaries in the scrubland of Garraf Natural Park (Barcelona), and related these measures to visitation rates of honey bees, bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and other pollinators. In the same plots, we measured flower density, and used pan traps to characterize the wild bee community. Flower resource consumption was largely explained by honey bee visitation and marginally by bumblebee visitation. After accounting for flower density, plots close to apiaries had lower wild bee biomass. This was due to a lower abundance of large bee species, those more likely to be affected by honey bee competition. We conclude that honey bees are the main contributors to pollen/nectar consumption of the two main flowering plants in the scrubland, and that at the densities currently occurring in the park (3.5 hives/km2) the wild bee community is being affected. Our study supports the hypothesis that high honey bee densities may have an impact on other pollinators via competition for flower resources. © 2015 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Article,Scopus

These signals are often visually complex with a colour pattern that contrasts between outer and central parts. The significance of this colour complexity for the pollination success of flowers of deceptive orchids has scarcely been investigated. We tested the effects of the colour patterns of the food-deceptive orchid Paphiopedilum micranthum on bumblebee visitation choices and pollination success using behavioural experiments in a community context. Using comparative phylogenetic analysis and a bee vision model, we also compared the colour patterns of P. micranthum with those of its congeners and sympatric food flowers. The probability of both long-range approach and close-up choice by bumblebees to orchids was all enhanced in communities with food flowers similar in colour pattern to the orchid. Probability of long-range approach and close-up choice was negatively correlated with colour distance between orchid and food flowers in floral outer and centre, respectively. Flowers of P. micranthum that were manipulated to reduce visual complexity had reduced male and female pollination success. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the outer floral colour of P. micranthum is apomorphic and thus likely represents an evolutionary innovation, whereas the central colour is plesiomorphic and thus likely to function in the bumblebee pollination system as an exaptation. The contrast between the inner and outer colours appears to exploit visual preferences of bumblebees acquired during foraging on local food plants with similar colour patterns. This study highlights the adaptive significance of colour patterns in successful food deception and the importance of complex signals in facilitating interspecific interactions. © 2016 British Ecological Society.",Article,Scopus

In this context, we examined the effect of heterogeneous landscapes surrounding and including commercial apple orchards on pollinator visitation and foraging distance during bloom period from 2011 to 2013 in Pennsylvania. Our results showed that the frequency of feral honeybees and solitary bee visits within an apple orchard depends on the proximity of the orchard to an unmanaged habitat (primarily comprised of forest). At the landscape scale, we found that the Mean Proximity Index, the Largest Patch Index, and the Number of Patches positively correlated with the visitation rate of dominant bee taxa (Apis mellifera, Bombus spp., and solitary bees) visiting apple flowers at low spatial scales (up to 500 m around the orchards). The Mean Proximity Index at 500 m was related to bee visitation patterns, especially for solitary bees and A. mellifera. Bees in all our study sites preferred to forage in areas with large homogenous patches up to 500 m around an apple orchard. This effect can be attributed to the mass flowering of apples that formed the largest proportion of the 500 m spatial scale. The Number of Patches at 250 m spatial scale was positively correlated with bee visitation, especially Bombus spp., probably because these areas had more habitats and more resources required by these bees. We conclude that retaining unmanaged habitats closer to commercial apple orchards will maintain biodiversity within the landscapes and insure pollination services to apples. © 2016 Joshi, Otieno, Rajotte, Fleischer and Biddinger.",Article,Scopus

Species respond to such environmental modifications by adapting to new conditions or by shifting their geographic distributions towards more suitable areas. The latter might be constrained by species' functional traits that influence their ability to move, reproduce or establish. Here, we show that functional traits related to dispersal, reproduction, habitat use and diet have influenced how three pollinator groups (bees, butterflies and hoverflies) responded to changes in climate and land-use in the Netherlands since 1950. Across the three pollinator groups, we found pronounced areal range expansions (>53%) and modelled range shifts towards the north (all taxa: 17-22 km), west (bees: 14 km) and east (butterflies: 11 km). The importance of specific functional traits for explaining distributional changes varied among pollinator groups. Larval diet preferences (i.e. carnivorous vs. herbivorous/detritivorous and nitrogen values of host plants, respectively) were important for hoverflies and butterflies, adult body size for hoverflies, and flight period length for all groups. Moreover, interactions among multiple traits were important to explain species' geographic range shifts, suggesting that taxon-specific multi-trait analyses are needed to predict how global change will affect biodiversity and ecosystem services.!",Article,Scopus

The bivoltine bee Andrena bicolor is reported to be polylectic and oligolectic (on Campanula) in the spring and summer generations, respectively. Neurological constraints are assumed to govern pollen diet in bees. However, evidence comes predominantly from studies with oligolectic bees. We have investigated how sensory constraints influence the innate foraging behavior of A. bicolor and have tested whether bees of different generations evolved behavioral and sensory polyphenism to cope better with the host flowers available in nature when they are active. Results: Behavioral and sensory polyphenisms were tested in choice assays and electroantennographic analyses, respectively. In the bioassays, we found that females of both generations (1) displayed a similar innate relative reliance on visual and olfactory floral cues irrespective of the host plants tested; (2) did not prefer floral cues of Campanula to those of Taraxacum (or vice versa) and (3) did not display an innate preference for yellow and lilac colors. In the electroantennographic analyses, we found that bees of both generations responded to the same set of compounds. Conclusion: Overall, we did not detect seasonal polyphenism in any trait examined. The finding that bees of both generations are not sensory constrained to visit a specific host flower, which is in strict contrast to results from studies with oligolectic bees, suggest that also bees of the second generation have a flexibility in innate foraging behavior and that this is an adaptive trait in A. bicolor. We discuss the significance of our findings in context of the natural history of A. bicolor and in the broader context of host-range evolution in bees. © 2016 Milet-Pinheiro et al.",Article,Scopus

Their contribution to this essential ecosystem service has been threatened over recent decades by changes in land use, which have led to declines in their populations. In order to design effective conservation measures, it is important to understand the effects of variation in landscape composition and structure on the foraging activities of worker bumble bees. This is because the viability of individual colonies is likely to be affected by the trade-off between the energetic costs of foraging over greater distances and the potential gains from access to additional resources. We used field surveys, molecular genetics, and fine resolution remote sensing to estimate the locations of wild bumble bee nests and to infer foraging distances across a 20-km2 agricultural landscape in southern England, UK. We investigated five species, including the rare B. ruderatus and ecologically similar but widespread B. hortorum. We compared worker foraging distances between species and examined how variation in landscape composition and structure affected foraging distances at the colony level. Mean worker foraging distances differed significantly between species. Bombus terrestris, B. lapidarius, and B. ruderatus exhibited significantly greater mean foraging distances (551, 536, and 501 m, respectively) than B. hortorum and B. pascuorum (336 and 272 m, respectively). There was wide variation in worker foraging distances between colonies of the same species, which was in turn strongly influenced by the amount and spatial configuration of available foraging habitats. Shorter foraging distances were found for colonies where the local landscape had high coverage and low fragmentation of seminatural vegetation, including managed agri-environmental field margins. The strength of relationships between different landscape variables and foraging distance varied between species, for example the strongest relationship for B. ruderatus being with floral cover of preferred forage plants. Our findings suggest that management of landscape composition and configuration has the potential to reduce foraging distances across a range of bumble bee species. There is thus potential for improvements in the design and implementation of landscape management options, such as agri-environment schemes, aimed at providing foraging habitat for bumble bees and enhancing crop pollination services. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus

Because of its exponential diffusion and its serious threat to the local honeybee colonies (and to humans as well), restraint measures are currently under investigation. We developed and tested an harmonic radar capable of tracking the flying trajectory of these insects, once equipped with a small transponder, in their natural environment. Several hornets were captured close to a small cluster of honeybee hives, tagged with different transponders and then released in order to follow the flight toward their nest. On-field testing proved an initial maximum detection range of about 125 m in a hilly and woody area. A number of detections were clearly recorded, and preferential directions of flight were identified. The system herein described is intended as a first low-cost harmonic radar; it proved the capability to track the hornets while flying and it permitted to test the tagging techniques. Several upgrades of the system have been identified during this work and are extensively described in the last chapter. The designed system has three major advantages over conventional harmonic radars. First and most importantly, it adopts advanced processing techniques to suppress clutter and to improve target detection. Second, it allows radar operations in complex environments, generally hilly and rich in vegetation. Finally, it can continuously track tagged insects (24/7) and in any meteorological condition, providing an effective tool in order to locate the nests of the yellow-legged Asian hornet. © 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,Scopus

However, colony density and arrangement strategies are not generally based on replicated scientific trials, so there is considerable uncertainty regarding effectiveness of different practices. We address this problem with experiments in almond orchards in south-east Australia, considering impacts on honeybee pollen foraging and fruit set. We examined the effect of distance from colony location on the depletion rate of pollen from flowers near (~40 m) and far (260-490 m) from colonies in almond orchards. We assessed pollen loads of 950 flowers in total, collected at four times of day (9-9:30 h, 11-11:30 h, 13-13:30 h and 15-15:30 h), from 8 near: far pairs. We also surveyed fruit set on nearly 900 trees in replicated transects over two seasons to determine the effect of distance from colony when using large placements of colonies (~120 colonies, N = 581 trees), and effect of colony density when using smaller placements of colonies (N = 313 trees). Flowers near colonies maintained an approximately constant mean pollen load over the course of the day, indicating that the rate of pollen released by flowers was matched by the rate of pollen collection by bees. Flowers far from colonies increased in pollen load over the course of the day, indicating relatively less pollen-collecting activity, so that by 15:30 h they had, on average, 46% more than flowers near colonies. Fruit set declined with distance by 22% over 850 m, consistent with the observation that pollen foraging declines over distance from colony. Fruit set also declined with colony density from 46% at 6·8 colonies per ha to 33% at 2·8 colonies per ha. Synthesis and applications. Pollen-collecting activity is relatively low at flowers far from honeybee colonies, creating a risk of lost yield through underpollination. Fruit set declines if colony density is reduced below 6·8 colonies per ha. Pollination outcomes in terms of fruit set are improved when fewer colonies are used per placement (<100) and placements of colonies are arranged with shorter distances (<700 m) between them, so that more trees are within 400 m of colonies.

Pollinator-dependent crops rely on mobile animals like bees for crop production, and the spatial relationship between floral resources and nest location for these central-place foragers influences the delivery of pollination services. Current models that map pollination coverage in agricultural regions utilize landscape-level estimates of floral availability and nesting incidence inferred from expert opinion, rather than direct assessments. Foraging distance is often derived from proxies of bee body size, rather than direct measurements of foraging that account for behavioral responses to floral resource type and distribution. The lack of direct measurements of nesting incidence and foraging distances may lead to inaccurate mapping of pollination services. We examined the role of local-scale floral resource presence from hedgerow plantings on nest incidence of ground-nesting bees in field margins and within monoculture, conventionally managed sunflower fields in California's Central Valley. We tracked bee movement into fields using fluorescent powder. We then used these data to simulate the distribution of pollination services within a crop field. Contrary to expert opinion, we found that ground-nesting native bees nested both in fields and edges, though nesting rates declined with distance into field. Further, we detected no effect of field-margin floral enhancements on nesting. We found evidence of an exponential decay rate of bee movement into fields, indicating that foraging predominantly occurred in less than 1% of medium-sized bees' predicted typical foraging range. Although we found native bees nesting within agricultural fields, their restricted foraging movements likely centralize pollination near nest sites. Our data thus predict a heterogeneous distribution of pollination services within sunflower fields, with edges receiving higher coverage than field centers. To generate more accurate maps of services, we advocate directly measuring the autecology of ecosystem service providers, which vary by crop system, pollinator species, and region. Improving estimates of the factors affecting pollinator populations can increase the accuracy of pollination service maps and help clarify the influence of farming practices on wild bees occurring in agricultural landscapes. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus

These relationships are often phylogenetically shared; thus quantifying allometric relationships may allow for estimating difficult-to-measure traits across species. One such trait, proboscis length in bees, is assumed to be important in structuring bee communities and plantpollinator networks. However, it is difficult to measure and thus rarely included in ecological analyses. We measured intertegular distance (as a measure of body size) and proboscis length (glossa and prementum, both individually and combined) of 786 individual bees of 100 species across 5 of the 7 extant bee families (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila). Using linear models and model selection, we determined which parameters provided the best estimate of proboscis length. We then used coefficients to estimate the relationship between intertegular distance and proboscis length, while also considering family. Using allometric equations with an estimation for a scaling coefficient between intertegular distance and proboscis length and coefficients for each family, we explain 91% of the variance in species-level means for bee proboscis length among bee species. However, within species, individual-level intertegular distance was a poor predictor of individual proboscis length. To make our findings easy to use, we created an R package that allows estimation of proboscis length for individual bee species by inputting only family and intertegular distance. The R package also calculates foraging distance and body mass based on previously published equations. Thus by considering both taxonomy and intertegular distance we enable accurate estimation of an ecologically and evolutionarily important trait. © 2016 Cariveau et al.

Attributes of resilience, adaptability and vigour which engender the hybrids for wood production, may also exacerbate the risk they present from gene flow to native species gene pools or to local ecologies as weeds. To determine the biological and genetic factors that influence the extent of hybridisation, we examine the distribution and genealogy of wildlings surrounding plantings of locally-exotic Corymbia torelliana (Section Cadageria) near native C. henryi (Section Maculatae) in northern New South Wales. Our study showed pre-mating and pre- and post-zygotic barriers were incomplete, with in situ generation and natural establishment of both F1 hybrids (n=3) and advanced generation hybrids under the disturbed conditions bordering native forest. As hybrids were located on alluvial flats exposed to frost, they also likely have an extended ecological range relative to native C. henryi. Despite the likely generation of large viable seed crops on F1 trees at the site over many years, establishment success and survival of advanced generation hybrids may be low, as only 5 immature and no mature advanced generation hybrids were identified. Propagation and genetic analysis of a seed crop from one F1 wildling showed early survival and vigour of seedlings in cultivation was high, and that at least for some F1 in some seasons, backcrossing to the recurrent native C. henryi parent is favoured (60%), whereas selfing (10%) and crossing with other F1 (30%) was less frequent. Transport of seed by stingless bees probably accounted for long distance dispersal from C. torelliana, but this mechanism does not appear to supplement gravity-dispersal of seed from the F1. Coupled with other evidence from studies of bee behaviour, controlled pollination in Corymbia sp., and long-term fitness in second generation eucalypt hybrids, we anticipate gene flow via pollen rather than seed will be the greater challenge for managing the risk of introgression of C. torelliana ancestry into native species from the planted F1 hybrid. If large sources of F1 pollen become available to compete with native pollen, gene flow will probably be frequent and hybrids may establish in disturbed conditions and in habitats beyond the ecological range of their native parent. Further study is needed to determine the degree to which outbreeding depression and poor survival inhibits on-going gene flow. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",Article,Scopus

This unique foraging behaviour has been computationally realized as an algorithmic tool named the Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) algorithm to solve different types of Combinatorial Optimization Problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In order to enhance the performance of the BCO algorithm, it is integrated with a local optimization approach and a pruning strategy named as the Frequency-based Pruning Strategy (FBPS), which allows a subset of bees to undergo the local optimization and hence reduces the high processing overhead of the local optimization. Although the local optimization and the FBPS enhance the performance of the BCO algorithm, the FBPS becomes not scalable when building blocks in various sizes are considered in its pruning operation. This paper proposes a pruning strategy which employs the bi-directional extension (BIDE) based frequent closed pattern mining algorithm. It is named as the Frequent-closed-pattern-based Pruning Strategy (FCPBPS). The FCPBPS consists of two major operations: solutions accumulation and pruning operation. Solutions generated by bees are accumulated throughout the BCO algorithm execution. Based on the accumulated solutions, a set of frequent closed patterns in various sizes is mined using the BIDE algorithm. This set of frequent closed patterns is used in the FCPBPS pruning operation such that only relatively better bees (i.e. bees that produce solution which contains many of these frequent closed patterns) are allowed to undergo the local optimization. A total of 18 selected symmetric TSP benchmark problems range from 318 cities to 1291 cities are used as the testbed of this research. On average, the experimental results show that the FCPBPS requires 20.2% lesser computational time compared to the FBPS, to yield similar best-so-far TSP tour lengths. © 2015 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Twelve honeybee colonies were used per treatment group, 4 each located at the field edge (on-field site), at approximately 500m and 1000m from the field. A total of nearly 300 newly emerged bees per colony were fitted (tagged) with Mic3 radio frequency identification (RFID) transponders and introduced into each of the 36 study hives. The RFID readers fitted to the entrances of the test colonies were used to monitor the activity of the tagged bees for the duration of the 5-wk flowering period of the crop. These activity data were analyzed to assess any impact on flight activity of bees foraging on the treated compared with untreated crops. Honeybees were seen to be actively foraging within all 3 treatment groups during the exposure period. The data for the more than 3000 RFID-tagged bees and more than 90000 foraging flights monitored throughout the exposure phase for the study follow the same trends across the treatment and controls and at each of the 3 apiary distances, indicating that there were no effects from foraging on the treated crop. Under the experimental conditions, there was no effect of foraging on thiamethoxam-treated oilseed rape on honeybee flight activity or on their ability to return to the hive.

To investigate the effects of changing conditions on fitness, we conducted field experiments using the central-place-foraging alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundata), examining the changes in sex allocation when presented with changes in flight distance required to obtain resources. The results suggest that changes in flight distance to resources during the year’s flight season altered subsequent allocation decisions: mothers experiencing long flight distance to resources early in the season and short flight distance later in the season generated a greater proportion of female offspring than mothers experiencing the opposite. During the second half of the season, however, it was current experimental conditions significantly impacting decisions with those mothers residing near the resources producing a greater portion of female offspring than those far from resources, regardless of flight distances experienced earlier in the year. These results show that sex allocation decisions may change dynamically during a female’s lifetime in response to ecological changes. We also looked at these results through the contradicting hypotheses marginal value theorem and sex ratio theory, finding that the latter may be in play depending on an individual’s past and/or present condition. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus

For example, pollinators may limit species’ ranges if floral abundance or floral attractiveness is reduced at range margins, thus causing lower pollinator visitation and reduced reproductive output. METHODS: To test if pollinators influence the altitudinal distribution of Erythronium montanum (Liliaceae) at Mount Rainier National Park, we asked whether (1) seed production in this species relies on pollinators, (2) seed production and pollen limitation is greatest at range limits, and (3) pollinator visitation rates (either overall or by individual taxonomic groups) reflect patterns of seed production and pollen limitation. RESULTS: From this three-year study, we established that this plant does rely on pollinators for fruit set and we found that pollen limitation trended toward being higher at the upper range limit in some years, but not consistently year to year. Insect visitation rates did not mirror spatial patterns of pollen limitation, but annually variable pollinator composition suggested differential importance of some pollinator taxonomic groups (specifically, bumblebees may be better pollinators than syrphid flies). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that while pollinators are critical for the reproductive success of this high mountain wildflower, plant-pollinator interactions do not obviously drive the distribution of this species. Nonetheless, high spatio-temporal variability in range-wide plant-pollinator dynamics may complicate responses to climate change. © 2016 Botanical Society of America.",Article,Scopus

The cultivation of lulo outside of its native range, for example in European glasshouses, requires the presence of efficient pollinators to enable high fruit set and yield. Until now, the suitability of Bombus terrestris L., native to Europe and commonly used in agriculture, has been untested for this purpose. In this study, the pollen-collecting behaviour of B. terrestris when visiting lulo flowers was investigated. It was shown that B. terrestris adopted the lulo as a pollen source, and on average visited three flowers per minute, had five buzzing events per stay and foraged for 15 s on a single flower, independently of the previous number of visits and level of bruising to the anthers. The pollination efficiency of five different treatments was evaluated: (i) exclusion of bees, (ii) single and (iii) multiple visits of B. terrestris, (iv) self- and (v) cross-pollination by hand. The results clearly demonstrated that, for fruit set, pollination is crucial. It was also found that lulo flowers can be successfully self-pollinated, but give 25% fewer fruit set compared with pollination via multiple bumblebee visits, or cross-pollination by hand. Fruit set, seed set and fruit size were as high with pollination by B. terrestris as with cross-pollination by hand, indicating that this bumblebee is an appropriate pollinator for lulo. However, B. terrestris was conspicuously less effective when a flower was visited only once. Therefore, when growing lulos commercially, multiple bumblebee visits should be encouraged, but it is likely that the behaviour of B. terrestris would ensure this anyway. Our results indicate that B. terrestris is a suitable and efficient pollinator for the production of lulo fruits. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",Article,Scopus

The age of an insect strongly influences many aspects of behavior and reproduction. The interaction of age and behavior is epitomized in the temporal polyethism of honey bees in which young adult bees perform nurse and maintenance duties within the colony, while older bees forage for nectar and pollen. Task transition is dynamic and driven by colony needs. However, an abundance of precocious foragers or overage nurses may have detrimental effects on the colony. Additionally, honey bee age affects insecticide sensitivity. Therefore, determining the age of a set of individual honey bees would be an important measurement of colony health. Pteridines are purine-based pigment molecules found in many insect body parts. Pteridine levels correlate well with age, and wild caught insects may be accurately aged by measuring pteridine levels. The relationship between pteridines and age varies with a number of internal and external factors among many species. Thus far, no studies have investigated the relationship of pteridines with age in honey bees. Methods. We established single-cohort colonies to obtain age-matched nurse and forager bees. Bees of known ages were also sampled from colonies with normal demographics. Nurses and foragers were collected every 3-5 days for up to 42 days. Heads were removed and weighed before pteridines were purified and analyzed using previously established fluorometric methods. Results. Our analysis showed that pteridine levels significantly increased with age in a linear manner in both single cohort colonies and colonies with normal demography. Pteridine levels were higher in foragers than nurses of the same age in bees from single cohort colonies. Head weight significantly increased with age until approximately 28-days of age and then declined for both nurse and forager bees in single cohort colonies. A similar pattern of head weight in bees from colonies with normal demography was observed but head weight was highest in 8-day old nurse bees and there was no relationship of head weight with age of foragers. Discussion. Although the relationship between pteridine levels and age was significant, variation in the data yielded a +4-day range in age estimation. This allows an unambiguous method to determine whether a bee may be a young nurse or old forager in colonies with altered demographics as in the case of single cohort colonies. Pteridine levels in bees do not correlate with age as well as in other insects. However, most studies used insects reared under tightly controlled laboratory conditions, while we used freeliving bees. The dynamics of head weight change with age is likely to be due to growth and atrophy of the hypopharyngeal glands. Taken together, these methods represent a useful tool for assessing the age of an insect. Future studies utilizing these methods will provide a more holistic view of colony health. © 2016 Rinkevich et al.",Article,Scopus

Flower colour is responsible for attraction from a distance, whereas contrasting colour patterns within flowers aid orientation of flower visitors after approaching the flowers. Due to the striking differences in colour vision systems and neural processing across animal taxa, flower colours evoke specific behavioural responses by different flower visitors. We tested whether and how yellow flowers differ in their spectral reflectance depending on the main pollinator. We focused on bees and birds and examined whether the presence or absence of the widespread UV reflectance pattern of yellow flowers predicts the main pollinator. Most bee-pollinated flowers displayed a pattern with UV-absorbing centres and UV-reflecting peripheries, whereas the majority of bird-pollinated flowers are entirely UV- absorbing. In choice experiments we found that bees did not show consistent preferences for any colour or pattern types. However, all tested bee species made their first antennal contact preferably at the UV-absorbing area of the artificial flower, irrespective of its spatial position within the flower. The appearance of UV patterns within flowers is the main difference in spectral reflectance between yellow bee- and bird-pollinated flowers, and affects the foraging behaviour of flower visitors.

Forage bee flora was compared with respect to species richness, diversity, and evenness indices. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to characterize relationship between species composition and environmental variables. The bee forage species richness and abundance were significantly greater on railway embankments than on road verges. The composition of species varied considerably; the number of bee forage species common to both habitats was only approximately 38% in entire data set. Most good-value bee forage species were recorded along the embankments of railways with an intermediate traffic volume. Bee forage species diversity benefits from the location of habitat elements (forests or meadows), primarily if the distance is <50 m.

High plant diversity could favor short foraging trips, which in turn would enhance bee fitness. In addition to plant diversity, greater temporal stability of floral resources in diverse communities could favor pollinator fitness because such communities are likely to occupy the phenological space more broadly, increasing floral availability for pollinators throughout the season. In addition, this potential effect of flower diversity on bee reproduction could be stronger for generalist pollinators because they can use a broader floral spectrum. Based on above arguments we predicted that pollinator reproduction would be positively correlated to flower diversity, and to temporal stability in flower production, and that this relationship would be stronger for the most generalized pollinator species. Materials and Methods: Using structural equation models, we evaluated the effect of these variables and other ecological factors on three estimates of bee reproduction (average number of brood cells per nest per site, total number of brood cells per site, and total number of nests per site), and whether such effects were modulated by bee generalization on floral resources. Results: Contrary to our expectations, flower diversity had no effect on bee reproduction, stability in flower production had a weakly negative effect on one of the bee reproductive variables, and the strength of the fitness-diversity relationship was unrelated to bee generalization. In contrast, elevation had a negative effect on bee reproduction, despite the narrow elevation range encompassed by our sites. Discussion: Flower diversity did not affect the reproduction of the solitary bees studied here. This result could stem from the context dependence of the diversity-stability relationship, given that elevation had a positive effect on flower diversity but a negative effect on bee reproduction. Although high temporal stability in flower production is expected to enhance pollinator reproduction, in our study it had a weakly negative-instead of positive-effect on the average number of brood cells per nest. Other environmental factors that vary with elevation could influence bee reproduction. Our study focused on a small group of closely-related bee species, which cautions against generalization of our findings to other groups of pollinators.

Currently, mutualistic interactions among plants and animals are recognized for their paramount importance in biodiversity maintenance, especially in tropical ecosystems. In this chapter, we review the literature and present unpublished data on the ecology of mutualistic interactions among free-living species in Brazilian megadiverse montane Rupestrian Grasslands, the Campo Rupestre. We focus on interactions between plants and their pollinators and seed dispersers, and also interactions between ants, myrmecophilous plants and trophobiont insects. We provide basic information on mutualistic interactions, including data on natural history in addition to more advanced studies using network-based approaches. Only in the past decade mutualistic interactions have become intensively studied in Campo Rupestre, but information is still scattered and concentrated for a few localities. Pollination is an important process for reproduction of most plant species studied so far, with bees and hummingbirds acting as the main pollinators. Seemingly, animal pollination is more important than seed dispersal for gene flow across plant populations. Most vertebrate seed dispersal is carried out by non-specialized avian frugivorous, but also by short-distance seed dispersers such as ants and lizards. Moreover, ants are diversified and abundant group that seem to play a major role in these ecosystems, acting as secondary seed dispersers, as nectar thieves, and as bodyguards of plants and insects. We conclude this chapter by pointing out some gaps in our knowledge and proposing avenues for future research. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Book Chapter,Scopus

Tropical mountain building, in turn, leads to highland ""cloud forest"" microclimates with increased rainfall, lower diurnal temperatures, and diverse microclimates. I have previously emphasized how the geologically recent growth of mountains has been localized in Central America and that this is likely a factor in the high diversity and endemism in those highlands. This paper will show that Andean uplift accelerated at ~15 Ma ago and ~5 Ma BP and continues to this day. This process evolved geographically among the cordilleras of the region. Givnish and others recently presented phylogenomic evidence that the diversity of many epiphytic orchids, including tribes found in the neotropics, also accelerated during this time interval. Phylogenetic investigations of tropical orchid pollinators have shown that acceleration in speciation in such pollinators as hummingbirds, orchid bees, and flies occurred over this same time frame, suggesting that geologically driven environmental changes may have acted in concert with changes in orchid biology to speed up orchid diversity in these highlands. I also review some of the long-distance dispersal processes of orchids in the tropical Americas. River systems draining the Colombian Andes discharge into the Caribbean Sea and current-driven log-raft drifts and air suspension during cyclonic storms transport plants and animals from east to the west.

However, the persistence of invaders in a wide range of ecological communities may mean that they provide resources and refuge for threatened native species, or supplement ecosystem services. Location: Agroecosystems in the USA. Methods: We use a 2-year field experiment to explore the potential positive and negative impacts of an invasive thistle (Carduus acanthoides) on the composition of the resident community of foraging insects. The presence or absence of the thistle was the only difference in experimental and control plots comprising a background community of ten flowering annual species. Results: We demonstrate that the invasive thistle is both highly visited and strongly preferred by bees relative to other flowering species. Bee abundance was 302% higher and bee species richness 35% higher in habitat patches where the thistle was present compared to where it was absent. In addition, the abundance of Bombus species, a native group recently found to be in decline, was 479% higher when the thistle was present. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that, despite causing significant problems, the invasion of this non-native species may also provide crucial benefits via floral resources for pollinators. Benefits, such as the floral resources that invaders provide to pollinators, should also be taken into account in conservation and invader management plans. Eradication or complete removal of invasive species which provision insects with floral resources could have unintended negative impacts on the associated pollinator community. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus

They are unusual in maintaining helping at a low level; only 11% of sons help and, when they do, they feed at nests of one or both parents, nestmate brothers, or rarely, grandfathers. On average, only 7% of pairs have helpers, although the range is 3-16% depending upon the year (Dickinson et al. 1996). Helping is facultative, with males able to switch from helping to breeding and back again within a season (Dickinson and Akre 1998). While their most common behavior is to breed in pairs, three characteristics render western bluebirds useful for understanding the evolution and maintenance of helping behavior as a facultative trait. First, the mode of helping is unusually fluid: in addition to the typical “stay-at-home” helpers, which delay dispersal, remain on their natal territory, and then help as yearlings, western bluebirds have “redirected helpers,” which help mid-season after their mate is killed or their nest fails (Figure 2.1). This makes the territorial system of western bluebirds more similar to that of colonial white-fronted bee-eaters (Merops bullockoides) in Kenya (Emlen and Wrege 1989) or Galápagos mockingbirds (Mimus parvulus; Curry and Grant 1990) than to the acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) with which they often share cavity trees and space (Chapter 13). Western bluebirds also have a third type of helper, “simultaneous breeder-helpers,” which breed adjacent to their parents and feed at both their parents’ nest and their own nest within a single day. This cross-territorial helping was our first hint that western bluebirds favor kin even while living on different territories. A strength of the study system is that we have been able to follow birds as they adopt these different options to gain important insights into each option’s relative fitness benefits. Second, although western bluebirds are marginal cooperative breeders in spring, they exhibit high levels of kin-based sociality in winter, living in stable family groups on their territories (Kraaijeveld and Dickinson 2001). This has afforded us the opportunity to examine the drivers and fitness consequences of delayed and localized dispersal, which we hypothesize provide the permissive conditions for kin-based helping. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",Book Chapter,Scopus

Bumblebees provide a useful model system to explore how different lifestyles are reflected in learning abilities, because their (female but sterile) workers and males engage in fundamentally different behaviour routines. Bumblebee males, like workers, embark on active flower foraging but in contrast to workers they have to trade off their feeding with mate search, potentially affecting their abilities to learn and utilize floral cues efficiently during foraging. We used a serial colour-learning task with freely flying males and workers to compare their ability to flexibly learn visual floral cues with reward in a foraging scenario that changed over time. Male bumblebees did not differ from workers in both their learning speed and their ability to overcome previously acquired associations, when these ceased to predict reward. In all foraging tasks we found a significant improvement in choice accuracy in both sexes over the course of the training. In both sexes, the characteristics of the foraging performance depended largely on the colour difference of the two presented feeder types. Large colour distances entailed fast and reliable learning of the rewarding feeders whereas choice accuracy on highly similar colours improved significantly more slowly. Conversely, switching from a learned feeder type to a novel one was fastest for similar feeder colours and slow for highly different ones. Overall, we show that behavioural sex dimorphism in bumblebees did not affect their learning abilities beyond the mating context. We discuss the possible drivers and limitations shaping the foraging abilities of males and workers and implications for pollination ecology. We also suggest stingless male bumblebees as an advantageous alternative model system for the study of pollinator cognition. © 2015 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

For this purpose, we developed a mechanistic, energetics-based model for a single day of nectar foraging in complex landscape mosaics. Net energetic efficiency determined resource patch choice. In one version of the model a single optimal patch was selected each hour. In another version, recruitment of foragers was simulated and several patches could be exploited simultaneously. Resource availability changed during the day due to depletion and/or intrinsic properties of the resource (anthesis). The model accounted for the impact of patch distance and size, resource depletion and replenishment, competition with other nectar foragers, and seasonal and diurnal patterns in availability of nectar-providing crops and wild flowers. From the model we derived simple rules for resource patch selection, e.g., for landscapes with mass-flowering crops only, net energetic efficiency would be proportional to the ratio of the energetic content of the nectar divided by distance to the hive. We also determined maximum distances at which resources like oilseed rape and clover were still energetically attractive. We used the model to assess the potential for pesticide exposure dilution in landscapes of different composition and complexity. Dilution means a lower concentration in nectar arriving at the hive compared to the concentration in nectar at a treated field and can result from foraging effort being diverted away from treated fields. Applying the model for all possible hive locations over a large area, distributions of dilution factors were obtained that were characterised by their 90-percentile value. For an area for which detailed spatial data on crops and off-field semi-natural habitats were available, we tested three landscape management scenarios that were expected to lead to exposure dilution: providing alternative resources than the target crop (oilseed rape) in the form of (i) other untreated crop fields, (ii) flower strips of different widths at field edges (off-crop in-field resources), and (iii) resources on off-field (semi-natural) habitats. For both model versions, significant dilution occurred only when alternative resource patches were equal or more attractive than oilseed rape, nearby and numerous and only in case of flower strips and off-field habitats. On an area-base, flower strips were more than one order of magnitude more effective than off-field habitats, the main reason being that flower strips had an optimal location. The two model versions differed in the predicted number of resource patches exploited over the day, but mainly in landscapes with numerous small resource patches. In landscapes consisting of few large resource patches (crop fields) both versions predicted the use of a small number of patches. ï¿½ 2016 Baveco et al.",Article,Scopus

The Nordic region of Europe is not currently one of them, but it could be. The drone brood in particular constitute an untapped source of delicious, nutritious and potentially sustainable food. Currently, it is removed by many beekeepers as part of a strategy to lower the population of the destructive Varroa mite (Varroa destructor) in the hive, but most often it is disposed of. A descriptive sensory analysis of drone brood was conducted, using larvae and pupae from four hives, three in Denmark and one in Norway, from locations spanning a range of urban/rural and monocultural/polycultural surroundings. Data were collected with a panel of 10 subjects using fast sensory methods, and were analysed with analysis of variance-partial least squares regression. The first dimension accounted for 40% of the variance, and correlated closely with differences in developmental stage between larvae and pupae; the second dimension accounted for 16% of the variance, and most closely grouped samples from three of the locations apart from those of the fourth. Developmental stage was thus found to be the primary determinant of sensory profile, followed by variations in locality, possibly related to local forage. Further studies should investigate the different parameters of sensory profile in more detail to develop a more complex picture of drone brood's taste and culinary potential - an important part of developing strategies to diversify our food sources and realise certain insects' ecological, culinary, and economic potential for local food systems. © 2016 Wageningen Academic Publishers.",Article,Scopus

By enhancing habitat heterogeneity and ecological connectivity, riparian buffer strips have the potential to promote insect pollinators in intensively managed landscapes. Insect pollinators and flowering plants were investigated on a range of riparian margins, and their adjacent grassland fields, to determine the main physical and botanical attributes driving pollinator diversity.Irrespective of whether they were fenced or not, riparian margins had richer plant assemblages and supported more pollinators than grassland fields. While the erection of fences did not enhance the richness or diversity of flowers, fenced riparian buffer strips supported more even and diverse assemblages of bumblebees and a greater number of butterflies than unfenced riparian margins. More bumblebees and butterflies were recorded in wide buffer strips (i.e. over 5. m wide) than in unfenced margins or narrow buffer strips (i.e. ≤3.5. m wide) and butterfly assemblages in wide buffer strips were richer and more diverse. There was a strong positive relationship between floral resources and the abundance, richness and diversity of bumblebee and butterfly assemblages. Pollinators only foraged on a small number of the flower species present and impacts of fencing and buffer strip width could not solely be attributed to the area and/or species richness of flowers.Fenced riparian buffer strips, particularly when over 5. m wide, have the potential to provide resources for insect pollinators in intensively grazed systems. Management to enhance floristic diversity (to provide a more continuous supply of pollen and nectar) and tussock forming grasses (to provide shelter for pollinators and nesting locations for bumblebees) could further increase their value to insect pollinators. In grassland systems, restricted grazing is easier to implement than mowing. It is, however, important that grazing management does not unduly interfere with other ecosystem services derived from riparian buffer strips (e.g. diffuse pollution mitigation). Widespread fencing of watercourses at the catchment level could result in the simplification of these inherently dynamic and complex habitats. Buffer strips should therefore be strategically placed to optimise benefits such as ecological connectivity and diffuse pollution mitigation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",Article,Scopus

However, it also identified a summer foraging 'hotspot' in agricultural land at 2-3. km distance. Unfortunately, dance decoding does not yield precise foraging locations or information on the flower species visited. Therefore, we surveyed this hotspot during July and August 2012 and 2013 in order to identify the habitats and flower species used by honey bees and other flower-visiting insects (FVI).The hotspot area consisted predominantly of four habitat types potentially attractive to FVI: pasture fields, field margins/hedgerows of arable fields, set-aside and a National Nature Reserve. We surveyed three fields within each habitat type. The abundance of flowers was found to be a key determent of FVI abundance per field (p= 0.002). Field margins/hedgerows were the most flower abundant habitat type (p= 0.002) and had more than twice (235%) the FVI abundance (p= 0.001) and species richness (p= 0.035) per unit area than did pasture fields. Areas with long grass had greater flower abundance (p< 0.001) and FVI species richness (p= 0.009) than those with short grass (≤30 cm). The five plants on which we recorded the greatest number of FVI were species considered to be agricultural weeds.Honey bees represented 19% of all FVI, showing that dance decoding had located a hotspot that was an important foraging location not just for honey bees but also for other types of FVI. Honey bee abundance, per transect, was strongly correlated with that of other FVI (p= 0.001), particularly bumble bees (p < 0.001). However, FVI groups were not found uniformly across our study site and honey bee abundance was only weakly linked to overall species richness (p= 0.069). © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

We investigated how exposing colonies to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid affect flight capacity of foragers. Flight distance, time and speed of foragers were measured in flight mills to assess the relative and interactive effects of high V. destructor load and a field-realistic, chronic sub-lethal dose of imidacloprid. Foragers from colonies exposed to high levels of V. destructor flew shorter distances, with a larger effect when also exposed to imidacloprid. Bee body mass partly explained our results as bees were heavier when exposed to these stressors, possibly due to an earlier onset of foraging. Our findings contribute to understanding of interacting stressors that can explain colony losses. Reduced flight capacity decreases the food-collecting ability of honeybees and may hamper the use of precocious foraging as a coping mechanism during colony (nutritional) stress. Ineffective coping mechanisms may lead to destructive cascading effects and subsequent colony collapse. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

Such pressures are not expected to affect all species identically; rather, they are likely to be mediated by the species' ecological traits. Understanding which types of species are most vulnerable under which land uses is an important step towards effective conservation planning. We collated occurrence and abundance data for 257 bee species at 1584 European sites from surveys reported in 30 published papers (70 056 records) and combined them with species-level ecological trait data. We used mixed-effects models to assess the importance of land use (land-use class, agricultural use-intensity and a remotely-sensed measure of vegetation), traits and trait × land-use interactions, in explaining species occurrence and abundance. Species' sensitivity to land use was most strongly influenced by flight season duration and foraging range, but also by niche breadth, reproductive strategy and phenology, with effects that differed among cropland, pastoral and urban habitats. Synthesis and applications. Rather than targeting particular species or settings, conservation actions may be more effective if focused on mitigating situations where species' traits strongly and negatively interact with land-use pressures. We find evidence that low-intensity agriculture can maintain relatively diverse bee communities; in more intensive settings, added floral resources may be beneficial, but will require careful placement with respect to foraging ranges of smaller bee species. Protection of semi-natural habitats is essential, however; in particular, conversion to urban environments could have severe effects on bee diversity and pollination services. Our results highlight the importance of exploring how ecological traits mediate species responses to human impacts, but further research is needed to enhance the predictive ability of such analyses.

However, it is unclear whether foragers tune their excitatory and inhibitory signalling according to food value and predation risk. We therefore studied the signals that honeybee foragers perform before and after being attacked by live predators (wasps and spiders) or a robo-predator at a nectar source. Predator attacks significantly reduced recruitment dancing and increased stop signalling, which inhibits dancing for the dangerous resource. Attack equally reduced dancing for all sucrose concentrations. However, foragers factored travel costs into their positive signalling. At the feeder with greater travel cost (100. m), bees danced less when they responded more severely to attacks. At the low travel cost feeder (1. m), there was no significant effect of attack response severity upon dancing. Attacks increased inhibitory signal production. Live and robo-predator attacks elicited 131-fold more stop signals from foragers as compared to control treatments of freshly dead predators that did not attack. However, food profitability, distance and sucrose concentration did not alter stop signalling. We suggest that this pattern may generally characterize excitatory/inhibitory signal pairs in group foraging. Foragers tune positive signalling (recruitment) to food quality and peril, and this is countered by an inhibitory signal that is tuned to danger but not resource value. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Article,Scopus

Recent concerns about the declines of both domestic and wild bees, calls for measures to promote wild pollinator populations in farmland. However, to be able to efficiently promote and prioritize between measures that benefit pollinators, such as modified land use, agri-environment schemes, or specific conservation measures, it is important to have a tool that accurately predicts how bees use landscapes and respond to such measures. In this paper we compare an existing model for predicting pollination (the ""Lonsdorf model""), with an extension of a general model for habitat use of central place foragers (the ""CPF model""). The Lonsdorf model has been shown to perform relatively well in simple landscapes, but not in complex landscapes. We hypothesized that this was because it lacks a behavioral component, assuming instead that bees in essence diffuse out from the nest into the landscape. By adding a behavioral component, the CPF model in contrast assumes that bees only use those parts of the landscape that enhances their fitness, completely avoiding foraging in other parts of the landscape. Because foraging is directed toward the most rewarding foraging habitat patches as determined by quality and distance, foraging habitat will include a wide range of forage qualities close to the nest, but a much narrower range farther away. We generate predictions for both simple and complex hypothetical landscapes, to illustrate the effect of including the behavioral rule, and for real landscapes. In the real landscapes the models give similar predictions for visitation rates in simple landscapes, but more different predictions in heterogeneous landscapes. We also analyze the consequences of introducing hedgerows near a mass-flowering crop field under each model. The Lonsdorf model predicts that any habitat improvement will enhance pollination of the crop. In contrast, the CPF model predicts that the hedgerow must provide good nesting sites, and not just foraging opportunities, for it to benefit pollination of the crop, because good forage quality alone may drain bees away from the field. Our model can be used to optimize pollinator mitigation measures in real landscapes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

This “honey at departure” is used as a material to build pollen loads (glue honey) as well as fuel during flight in pollen foragers. We investigated the relationship between the size of pollen loads that a forager collected and the amount of honey at departure in the Western honeybee, Apis mellifera. Dancing pollen foragers increased honey at departure with the size of collected pollen loads. Analysis of the waggle-run duration revealed that the size of pollen load affected the rate of increase of honey at departure with food source distance in dancers. The increase rate was significantly higher in dancers that had returned to the hive with large pollen loads versus nectar-collecting dancers, but not in those with smaller pollen loads. The higher increase rate may reflect additional fuel carried for the return trip in pollen-foraging specialists that do not use collected nectar as fuel. Although honey carried by departing dance followers also increased significantly with the size of pollen load carried by dancers, the adjustment was different from that of dancers. These results suggest that recruited bees adjust the amount of honey at departure, including glue honey, based on communicated information and modify the amount of honey load subsequently based on their own experience. © 2015, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).",Article,Scopus

Two study areas were employed: a pollen donor area composed of a clonal stand of a single pollen donor clone (PD) and a pollen sink (PS) area composed of a mixed clonal stand of two other clones (PS1 and PS2). In the pollen sink area four plots with 30 trees each, located at 25, 200, 400 and 550. m from the PD were established as sink islands. Before flowering, the entire clonal stands of clones PS1 and PS2, with exception of the sink islands were clear cut. Seeds were harvested from five randomly sampled trees in each sink island and the paternity of 15 seedlings per tree, 75 seedlings per island totaling a sample of 300 seedlings, was determined with PD as the alleged father. The self-pollination rate in the sink islands varied from zero to 24%. Paternity assignment to the PD was highest in the island at 25. m (17.3%) and rapidly decreased to 4.0% at 200. m and 2.7% at 550. m, suggesting a pattern of isolation by distance, while revealing a large pollen contribution from unaccounted sources across all islands. Our results in a fragmented clonal site agree with previous estimates of general pollen movement in eucalypt seed orchards, showing that pollination will take place by and large at relatively short distances of less than 200. m, consistent with the expected range of flight of pollinator bees. Nevertheless the exponential distribution observed also indicates that low levels of pollination success are to be expected over longer distances. Our data provide useful guidelines regarding the distance at which seed orchards should be established away from potentially large pollen pressure of clonal stands to minimize unwanted pollen introgression.

However, genetic diversity may not vary with stand size because insufficient time has passed since stands were established or pollen and propagule dispersal are sufficient to overwhelm the effects of genetic drift and founder events. We tested the predictions that, despite the potential of mangroves for dispersal of propagules by water and long distance dispersal of pollen by honeybees, fragmentation and localized foraging by honeybees causes small stands of A. marina to display reduced genetic diversity and elevated inbreeding. Using four microsatellite markers, we quantified the genetic and genotypic diversity present within samples of 20 adults taken from three large (&gt;1500 trees), intermediate (300–500 trees) and small (&lt;50 trees) stands within each of two urbanized estuaries and estimated mating system parameters using progeny arrays for sets of five adults within the large and small stands.

In contrast, our analysis of progeny arrays revealed that, while all stands displayed high levels of biparental inbreeding, an expected consequence of pollination by honeybees, current outcrossing rates (tm) were significantly lower in small (0.55) as compared to large (0.75) stands. The genetic makeup of the adult populations imply that stands are interconnected and suggest little impact of habitat fragmentation, while the progeny arrays suggest that plants within small stands may display reduced fitness. © 2015, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.",Article,Scopus

In addition, the relative effects of landscape composition (landscape heterogeneity) and landscape configuration (distance from seminatural grassland) on wild plant pollination, and the interaction between these landscape effects, have not been studied using landscape-level replication. We performed a field experiment to disentangle these landscape effects on the pollination of a native herb, the sticky catchfly (Lychnis viscaria), while accounting for the proportion of oilseed rape across landscapes and the local abundance of bee forage flowers. We measured pollen limitation (the degree to which seed set is pollen-limited), seed set, and seed set stability using potted plants placed in landscapes that differed in heterogeneity (composition) and distance from seminatural grassland (configuration). Pollen limitation and seed set in individual plants did not respond to landscape composition, landscape configuration, or proportion of oilseed rape. Instead, seed set increased with increasing local bee forage flower cover. However, we found within-plant variability in pollen limitation and seed set to increase with increasing distance from seminatural pasture. Our results suggest that average within-plant levels of pollen limitation and seed set respond less swiftly than the within-plant variability in pollen limitation and seed set to changes in landscape configuration.

Wild bees that nest or forage within agroecosystems may be exposed to numerous pesticides applied throughout their life cycles, with potential additive or synergistic effects. In pollinator-dependent crops, pesticides may reduce bee populations, creating trade-offs between pest management and crop pollination. In this three-year study, we examined the effects of pesticides on the abundance and species richness of wild bees within apple orchards of southern Wisconsin. We additionally deployed colonies of Bombus impatiens, a native and common species, in order to relate colony performance to orchard pesticide use. Utilizing grower spray records, we developed “toxicity scores” as a continuous index of pesticide use for each orchard, a measure that incorporated each pesticide’s relative toxicity to bees, its residual activity, and its application rate. While there was no relationship between total wild bee abundance and species richness with toxicity scores, there was a significant, negative effect on sweat bees, Lasioglossum spp. Many of these sweat bees are small-bodied, have short foraging ranges, are social, and have long foraging periods, all traits that could increase bee exposure or sensitivity to orchard pesticides. In addition, sentinel bumble bee colonies at orchards with high toxicity scores produced fewer, and smaller, workers. Bumble bees may also have a greater sensitivity and exposure to orchard pesticides due to their sociality and long foraging periods. Our results demonstrate that certain bee taxa may have a higher exposure or sensitivity to on-farm pesticide applications, and could therefore be vulnerable in agroecosystems. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA).",Article,Scopus

Pollination mutualisms depend greatly on pollinator behaviour, and many pollinators are attacked by a wide range of parasites and parasitoids. 3. To investigate whether parasites affect pollination service via changes in host behaviour, natural variation in conopid fly parasitism was used to investigate the relationship between infection and Bombus impatiens Cresson behaviour foraging on arrays of Trifolium pretense L. flowers in the laboratory. The consequences of infection for seed set and seed mass were also examined. 4. Conopid parasitism was not related to any measured behavioural response; however, flowers visited by conopid-parasitised bees set significantly heavier seeds than those visited by unparasitised bees.

Linear spectral unmixing and Change Vector Analysis (CVA) were used on the bi-temporal AISA/Eagle data to produce a hard cover map showing the spatial distribution, abundance and short-term flowering cycle of melliferous plants. Overall accuracies were slightly higher in the February 2013 imagery at the prime flowering period; all flowering plant groups together (""All"") could be mapped with an overall accuracy of 83% (. n=. 512). The ""White forbs"" flowering plant group was most accurately mapped in both AISA/Eagle acquisition dates. Based on Duncan's inter-class similarity test, the ""White forbs"" group was also most distinct from other flowering plant groups. There is a need to investigate the effect of spectral endmember variability and upscaling options for space-borne monitoring of the floral cycle at key sites in Africa. Floral cycle maps can help decision makers and bee keepers to understand how bee colonies interact with the floral environment and what to expect from an apiary in terms of honey flow. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus

Nevertheless, the wide scope and generality of this phenomenon remain underestimated by the scientific community. This limited appreciation for the pervasiveness of recursive movement can be attributed to its study by parallel lines of research, with different methodologies and nomenclature, and almost no cross referencing among them. Among these lines of studies are traplining behavior in foraging ecology, path recursions in movement ecology and the ecology of fear in predator-prey studies. We synthesize these three lines of research, to underline the mechanisms driving these patterns and create a conceptual model for recursive movement behavior across species and spatio-temporal scales. The emergence and complexity of recursive movement patterns are determined by the rate of resource recovery, environmental heterogeneity, the predictability of resource recovery, and the animal's cognitive capabilities. Our synthesis can be used to generate predictions within and among systems, as well as to promote the sharing of knowledge and methodologies gained in each sub-field. Such sharing can greatly advance our understanding of behavioral and ecological processes and provide novel opportunities for future research. © 2015 Berger-Tal and Bar-David.",Article,Scopus

Presented here is the design, development, and analysis of a novel biosurfactant protein we call Surfactant Resisting Foam formatioN (SRFN). Starting with the Tungara frog's foam forming protein Ranaspumin-2, we have engineered a new surfactant protein with a destabilized hinge region to alter the kinetics and equilibrium of the protein structural transition from aqueous globular form to an extended surfactant structure at the air/water interface. SRFN is capable of approximately the same total surface tension reduction, but with the unique property of forming quickly collapsible foams. The difference in foam formation is attributed to the destabilizing glycine substitutions engineered into the hinge region. Surfactants used specifically to increase wettability, such as those used in agricultural applications would benefit from this new proteosurfactant since foamed liquid has greater wind resistance and decreased dispersal. Indeed, given growing concern of organsilicone surfactant effects on declining bee populations, biological surfactant proteins have several unique advantages over more common amphiphiles in that they can be renewably sourced, are environmentally friendly, degrade readily into non-toxic byproducts, and reduce surface tension without deleterious effects on cell membranes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

Recently, a new type of estimator, known as the minimum mean OSPA (MMOSPA) estimator, which minimizes the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) metric, was proposed. Unfortunately, the MMOSPA estimator is unable to deliver a closed form solution when the objects, represented as a random finite set (RFS), are multidimensional or when the underlying posterior density is non-Gaussian; also, the existing MMOSPA estimators have not bee used to estimate unknown numbers of objects.

To determine from how far these wasps can return to their nests, we transported foragers blindfold and released them at gradually increasing distances from their nests in four cardinal directions. Their homing success was determined by checking their presence on their nests on three consecutive nights. All foragers (56 individuals, 115 releases) returned back from an area of 0.73 ± 0.25 km2 on the day of release (minimal homing area), whereas 83.8 % of the foragers (217 individuals, 420 releases) returned when we enlarged the area of release to 6.22 ± 0.66 km2 around their nests (maximal homing area). Of 66 releases, no wasps returned from beyond the maximal homing area.

We compared melissopalynology, where pollen grains retrieved from honey are identified morphologically, with a DNA metabarcoding approach using the rbcL DNA barcode marker and 454-pyrosequencing. We compared nine honeys supplied by beekeepers in the UK. DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology were able to detect the most abundant floral components of honey. There was 92% correspondence for the plant taxa that had an abundance of over 20%. However, the level of similarity when all taxa were compared was lower, ranging from 22-45%, and there was little correspondence between the relative abundance of taxa found using the two techniques. DNA metabarcoding provided much greater repeatability, with a 64% taxa match compared to 28% with melissopalynology. DNA metabarcoding has the advantage over melissopalynology in that it does not require a high level of taxonomic expertise, a greater sample size can be screened and it provides greater resolution for some plant families. However, it does not provide a quantitative approach and pollen present in low levels are less likely to be detected. We investigated the plants that were frequently used by honey bees by examining the results obtained from both techniques. Plants with a broad taxonomic range were detected, covering 46 families and 25 orders, but a relatively small number of plants were consistently seen across multiple honey samples. Frequently found herbaceous species were Rubus fruticosus, Filipendula ulmaria, Taraxacum officinale, Trifolium spp., Brassica spp. and the non-native, invasive, Impatiens glandulifera. Tree pollen was frequently seen belonging to Castanea sativa, Crataegus monogyna and species of Malus, Salix and Quercus.We conclude that although honey bees are considered to be supergeneralists in their foraging choices, there are certain key species or plant groups that are particularly important in the honey bees environment. The reasons for this require further investigation in order to better understand honey bee nutritional requirements. DNA metabarcoding can be easily and widely used to investigate floral visitation in honey bees and can be adapted for use with other insects. It provides a starting point for investigating how we can better provide for the insects that we rely upon for pollination. Copyright © 2015 Hawkins et al.",Article,Scopus

The phylogeny of Megabombus bumblebees shows that speciation was concentrated in two periods. Speciation in the first period (ca 4.25-1.5 Ma) is associated with the late rise of the Hengduan Mountains at the eastern end of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. Speciation in the second period (1.2-0.3 Ma) is associated with climatic cooling in the northern forests. The most extreme food-specialist species belong to the second period, which may point to climate as a factor in specialisation. These extreme specialist species occur either in the far north (Bombus consobrinus), or at high elevations (Bombus gerstaeckeri), in situations where long tongues coincide with the shortest nesting seasons. Species with the longest tongues but occurring further south (even at high elevations) use a broader range of food plants. Copyright: © 2015 Huang et al.",Article,Scopus

Here we report an experiment using the plant Antirrhinum majus and the bumblebee Bombus terrestris to investigate how prior learning experience may affect pollinator preferences between floral types when these are presented together. We trained naive bumblebees to forage freely on flowering individuals of either A. majus pseudomajus (magenta flowers) or A. majus striatum (yellow flowers) in a flight cage. We then used a Y-maze device to expose trained bumblebees to a dual choice between the floral types. We tested the influence of training on their choice, depending on the type of plant signals available (visual signals, olfactory signals, or both). Bumblebees had no innate preference for either subspecies. Bumblebees trained on the yellow-flowered subspecies later preferred the yellow type, even when only visual or only olfactory signals were available, and their preference was not reinforced when both signal types were available. In contrast, bumblebees trained on the magenta-flowered subspecies showed no further preference between floral types and took slightly more time to make their choice. Since pollinator constancy has been observed in wild populations of A. majus with mixed floral types, we suggest that such constancy likely relies on short-term memory rather than acquired preference through long-term memory induced by prior learning. © 2015 Jaworski et al.

This mite was originally a parasite of A. cerana in Asia but managed to spill over into colonies of A. mellifera which had been introduced to this continent for honey production. To date, only two almost clonal types of V. destructor from Korea and Japan have been detected in A. mellifera colonies. However, since both A. mellifera and A. cerana colonies are kept in close proximity throughout Asia, not only new spill overs but also spill backs of highly virulent types may be possible, with unpredictable consequences for both honeybee species. We studied the dispersal and hybridisation potential of Varroa from sympatric colonies of the two hosts in Northern Vietnam and the Philippines using mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers. We found a very distinct mtDNA haplotype equally invading both A. mellifera and A. cerana in the Philippines. In contrast, we observed a complete reproductive isolation of various Vietnamese Varroa populations in A. mellifera and A. cerana colonies even if kept in the same apiaries. In light of this variance in host specificity, the adaptation of the mite to its hosts seems to have generated much more genetic diversity than previously recognised and the Varroa species complex may include substantial cryptic speciation.

Such behavioral sequences can be of critical ecological importance, for example relating to resource acquisition, predator evasion, and sexual selection. The role of sequential behaviors in ecology, however, is understudied, in substantial part due to the difficulty of quantifying complex sequences. Here, we present a modified version of determinism (DET) from recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) as a standard metric for quantifying sequential behaviors. We focus on a case study of trapline foraging, a taxonomically widespread behavioral strategy in which animals repeatedly visit spatially fixed resources in a predictable order. Using a bumble bee movement dataset, we demonstrate how to calculate DET and create and interpret recurrence plots, which visually demonstrate patterns in foraging sequences. We show a new method for statistical comparisons of DET scores and assess the sensitivity of DET to resource density using simulated foraging sequences. We find that DET complements and offers distinct advantages over previously available methods for many questions and datasets since it does not depend on any particular resource arrangement or experimental setup and is relatively insensitive to resource density. These features make DET a powerful tool for comparing sequential behaviors between differing environments in a range of ecologically important contexts. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus

So far, the use of olfaction for food detection among raptors has only been demonstrated for Cathartes vultures. The Oriental honey buzzard (Pernis orientalis) is a resident and migrant in Taiwan and regularly forages in apiaries. One of its foods in apiaries is yellow pollen dough, a softball-sized mixture of pollen, soybeans, and sugar that beekeepers provide as a supplementary food for bees. Given that pollen dough is not similar to any naturally occurring food, we hypothesized that buzzards identify the dough's nutritious contents using olfaction, perhaps in combination with vision. Using a series of choice experiments in which individuals could choose between two doughs, we showed that (1) buzzards almost unerringly chose pollen-containing over pollen lacking doughs when otherwise the doughs were identical in size, shape, and yellow color; (2) buzzards always preferred yellow over black or green doughs if both doughs contained pollen; (3) buzzards still preferred pollen-containing over pollen-lacking doughs when both doughs were black, but at a lower rate than in (1).We statistically excluded the possible influences of the dough's relative brightness or of repeat visits by the same individuals. Our experiments thus suggest the use of a ""multi-modal foraging strategy"" among buzzards whereby olfaction and vision are likely to be both used in identifying food at close distances.We also estimated the olfactory receptor gene repertoire size in the buzzard's genome which is almost five times as large as that of three other raptor species. Therefore, olfaction is likely of far greater ecological importance to this species than to other raptor species. We suggest that olfaction should be considered in the design of behavioral and genetic studies to better understand the use of multiple senses in avian behaviors. © 2015 Yang et al.

These observations lend support to the 'Lévy flight foraging hypothesis' which asserts that natural selection should have led to adaptations for Lévy flight foraging, because Lévy flights can optimize search efficiencies. The hypothesis stems from a rigorous theory of one-dimensional searching and from simulation data for two-dimensional searching. The potential effectiveness of three-dimensional Lévy searches has not been examined but is central to a proper understanding of marine predators and T cells which have provided the most compelling empirical evidence for LW. Here I extend Lévy search theory from one to three dimensions. The new theory predicts that three-dimensional Lévy searching can be advantageous but only when targets are large compared with the perceptual range of the searchers, i.e. only when foragers are effectively blind and need to come into contact with a target to establish its presence. This may explain why effective blindness is a common factor among three-dimensional Lévy walkers. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

Whilst several studies have investigated how bees and wasps (aculeates) respond to management at the scale of the scheme (i.e. within the flower patch) there has been little assessment of how schemes affect diversity at the farm scale. In the current work we assessed whether farms implementing flower-rich schemes had richer aculeate communities than farms without such habitats. A total of 104 species of bee and 44 species of aculeate wasp were recorded. Farms providing flower-rich habitats had significantly greater floral abundance but there were no differences in the total number of aculeate or flowering plant species recorded compared to farms without these habitats. After accounting for differences in sample size, and contrary to expectations, farms without flower-rich habitats were significantly richer in aculeate and flowering plant species. Bumblebees (. Bombus spp.) and honeybees (. Apis mellifera) foraged strongly from sown flowers, but the majority of bee species preferred wild plants that are not included in flower-rich schemes such as Heracleum sphondylium, Hypochaeris radicata and Tripleurospermum inodorum. The creation of pollinator-friendly habitats has not increased the diversity of flowering plants and such schemes will consequently only benefit a limited suite of aculeate species.

Research oriented towards a better understanding of the joint effects of land use and climate change over the provision of specific ecosystem services is therefore essential to safeguard such services. Here we propose a methodological framework, which integrates species distribution forecasts and graph theory to identify key conservation areas, which if protected or restored could improve habitat connectivity and safeguard ecosystem services. We applied the proposed framework to the provision of pollination services by a tropical stingless bee (Melipona quadrifasciata), a key pollinator of native flora from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and important agricultural crops. Based on the current distribution of this bee and that of the plant species used to feed and nest, we projected the joint distribution of bees and plants in the future, considering a moderate climate change scenario (following IPPC). We then used this information, the bee's flight range, and the current mapping of Atlantic Forest remnants to infer habitat suitability and quantify local and regional habitat connectivity for 2030, 2050 and 2080. Our results revealed north to south and coastal to inland shifts in the pollinator distribution during the next 70 years. Current and future connectivity maps unraveled the most important corridors, which if protected or restored, could facilitate the dispersal and establishment of bees during distribution shifts. Our results also suggest that coffee plantations from eastern São Paulo and southern Minas Gerais States could suffer a pollinator deficit in the future, whereas pollination services seem to be secured in southern Brazil. Landowners and governmental agencies could use this information to implement new land use schemes. Overall, our proposed methodological framework could help design novel conservational and agricultural practices that can be crucial to conserve ecosystem services by buffering the joint effect of habitat configuration and climate change.

The better placement increases the productivity. This article introduces a new algorithm to design and optimize a fixed area cellular layout problem by using an artificial bee colony (ABC) technique which is based on the intelligent foraging behavior of a honeybee. The objective of this article is to determine the physical arrangement of work centers by minimizing the total traveling distance of the product. Volume of the product and distance between the work centers are the important factors that affect layout design. Some relative importance factors like priority of products, hazardous moves, and back-tracking moves are considered in this article. Layout moment ratio helps to compare the different proposed layouts. The higher layout moment ratio is the more desirable layout. Also this article compares the results of ABC technique with genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm based on the total moment value, layout moment ratio, number of iterations, computation time, and back-tracking movements. Finally, it concluded that ABC is a better technique to solve fixed area cellular layout problems than the mentioned algorithms with high dimensionality. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.",Article,Scopus

Unfortunately, bumblebees are challenged by various stress factors including insecticide applications. Today sublethal effects of various insecticides need to be thoroughly investigated to allow their combined use with pollinators and other beneficial organisms. In this study, we used lambda-cyhalothrin as a model pyrethroid insecticide and investigated lethal and sublethal effects by different dilutions, ranging from 1/10 to 1/100 of its maximum field recommended dosage (MFRC, 37.5 ppm), with the use of a chronic toxicity tests in the laboratory and in flight cages in the greenhouse. In the laboratory, small microcolonies with five bumblebee workers with one being pseudo-queen were used, while in the greenhouse we used queen-right mini-hives where the bumblebees need to fly for pyrethroid-contaminated food. We observed strong sublethal effects in the laboratory with treatments of 1/10 and 1/20 of the MFRC: the nest reproduction was reduced by 49 and 32 %, respectively, and the sugar water consumption by 36 %. With free-flying bumblebees, the toxic effects at 1/10 of the MFRC were more pronounced. A mortality of 88 ± 8 % was observed after only 2 weeks, being twice the mortality in the laboratory microcolonies test (43 ± 11 %). Besides, it should be mentioned that in the greenhouse experiment all queens were dead and most of the workers showed signs of incoordination and convulsion and gradually became apathetic. In conclusion, our results demonstrated the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin with a range of lethal and sublethal effects, both crucial for the development and survival of the B. terrestris colonies. Moreover, this study supports the demand to test insecticide compounds on their safety, especially when the bees have to perform complex tasks such as foraging for their food. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus

Several of those species build their own nests, while others are reported as nest cleptoparasites. Here, the objective was to evaluate whether the inclusion of a strong biotic interaction, such as the presence of a host species, improved the ability of species distribution models (SDMs) to predict the geographic range of the cleptoparasite species. The target species were Aglaecaeruleaand its host species Eulaema nigrita. Additionally, since A. caerulea is more frequently found in the Amazon rather than the Cerrado areas, a secondary objective was to evaluate whether this species is increasing or decreasing its distribution given South American past and current climatic conditions. SDMs methods (Maxent and Bioclim), in addition with current and past South American climatic conditions, as well as the occurrences for A. caerulea and E. nigrita were used to generate the distribution models. The distribution of A. caerulea was generated with and without the inclusion of the distribution of E. nigrita as a predictor variable. The results indicate A. caerulea was barely affected by past climatic conditions and the populations from the Cerrado savanna could be at least 21,000 years old (the last glacial maximum), as well as the Amazonian ones. On the other hand, in this study, the inclusion of the host-cleptoparasite interaction complex did not statistically improve the quality of the produced models, which means that the geographic range of this cleptoparasite species is mainly constrained by climate and not by the presence of the host species. Nonetheless, this could also be caused by unknown complexes of other Euglossini hosts with A. caerulea, which still are still needed to be described by science. © 2015 Silva et al.

However, studies investigating whether oligolectic bees recognize distinct host plants by using shared floral cues are scarce. In the present study, we investigated in a comparative approach the visual and olfactory floral cues of six Campanula species, of which only Campanula lactiflora has never been reported as a pollen source of the oligolectic bee Ch. rapunculi. We hypothesized that the flowers of Campanula species visited by Ch. rapunculi share visual (i.e. color) and/or olfactory cues (scents) that give them a host-specific signature. To test this hypothesis, floral color and scent were studied by spectrophotometric and chemical analyses, respectively. Additionally, we performed bioassays within a flight cage to test the innate color preference of Ch. rapunculi. Our results show that Campanula flowers reflect the light predominantly in the UV-blue/blue bee-color space and that Ch. rapunculi displays a strong innate preference for these two colors. Furthermore, we recorded spiroacetals in the floral scent of all Campanula species, but Ca. lactiflora. Spiroacetals, rarely found as floral scent constituents but quite common among Campanula species, were recently shown to play a key function for host-flower recognition by Ch. rapunculi. We conclude that Campanula species share some visual and olfactory floral cues, and that neurological adaptations (i.e. vision and olfaction) of Ch. rapunculi innately drive their foraging flights toward host flowers.

Urban habitats often support considerable biodiversity and so are of conservation value, even though they are highly modified ecosystems. Urban parks and gardens are rich in flowers that provide food for pollinators, including bees. Here, we use waggle dance decoding to investigate foraging by 3 honey bee hives located in the city of Brighton, UK, over almost an entire foraging season, April to October. Waggle dances were recorded using video cameras and decoded during framewise playback on a computer by measuring the angle and duration of the waggle phase. Foraging was mostly local (mean monthly distances 0.5–1.2 km) and mostly within the surrounding urban area (monthly means 78–92 %) versus the countryside (closest distance 2.2 km) even though this was well within the honey bee maximum foraging range (c. 12 km). These distances were lower than those from a previous study for hives located in a rural area 4.5 km away. Honey bees are very sensitive to foraging economics and foragers make waggle dances only after visiting high-quality feeding locations. Low distances advertised by dances, therefore, indicate sufficient forage nearby and show that urban areas can support honey bees year round. As a corollary, however, urban bees may provide little pollination service to agriculture especially in spring, which had the lowest foraging distances and is when the most economically important animal-pollinated UK crops, apple and oilseed rape, are in bloom. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Article,Scopus

The rate of behavioural development is highly plastic and responsive to changes in colony condition such that forager losses, disease or nutritional stresses accelerate behavioural development and cause an early onset of foraging in workers. It is not clear to what degree the behavioural development of workers can be accelerated without there being a cost in terms of reduced foraging performance. Here, we compared the foraging performance of bees induced to accelerate their behavioural development by treatment with the juvenile hormone analogue methoprene with that of controls that developed at a normal rate. Methoprene treatment accelerated the onset of both flight and foraging behaviour in workers, but it also reduced foraging span, the total time spent foraging and the number of completed foraging trips. Methoprene treatment did not alter performance in a short-range navigation task, however. These data indicate a limitation to the physiological plasticity of bees, and a trade off between forager performance and the speed at which bees begin foraging. Chronic stressors will be expected to reduce the mean age of the foraging force, and therefore also reduce the efficiency of the foraging force. This interaction may explain why honey bee colonies react to sustained stressors with non-linear population decline. © 2015 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.",Article,Scopus

However, whether the use of parallax information is confined to specialised behaviours like these or represents a more general purpose sensory capability, is an open question.We investigate this issue in the foraging swallowtail butterfly Papilio xuthus, which we trained to associate a target presented on a monitor with a food reward.We then tracked the animal's flight in realtime, allowing us to manipulate the size and/or position of the target in a closed-loop manner to create the illusion that it is situated either above or below the monitor surface. Butterflies are less attracted to (i.e. slower to approach) targets that appear, based on motion parallax, to be more distant. Furthermore, we found that the number of abortive descent manoeuvres performed prior to the first successful target approach varies according to the depth of the virtual target, with expansion and parallax cues having effects of opposing polarity. However, we found no evidence that Papilio modulate the kinematic parameters of their descents according to the apparent distance of the target. Thus, we argue that motion parallax is used to identify a proximal target object, but that the subsequent process of approaching it is based on stabilising its edge in the 2D space of the retina, without estimating its distance. © 2015 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Worldwide declines in bee populations have raised awareness about the importance of their ecological role in maintaining ecosystem functioning. The naturally strong philopatric behavior that some bee species show can be detrimental to population viability through increased probability of inbreeding. Furthermore, bee populations found in human-altered landscapes, such as urban areas, can experience lower levels of gene flow and effective population sizes, increasing potential for inbreeding depression in wild bee populations. In this study, we investigated the fine-scale population structure of the solitary bee Colletes inaequalis in an urbanized landscape. First, we developed a predictive spatial model to detect suitable nesting habitat for this ground nesting bee and to inform our field search for nests.We genotyped 18 microsatellites in 548 female individuals collected from nest aggregations throughout the study area. Genetic relatedness estimates revealed that genetic similarity among individuals was slightly greater within nest aggregations than among randomly chosen individuals. However, genetic structure among nest aggregations was low (Nei's G<inf>ST</inf> = 0.011). Reconstruction of parental genotypes revealed greater genetic relatedness among females than among males within nest aggregations, suggesting male-mediated dispersal as a potentially important mechanism of population connectivity and inbreeding avoidance. Size of nesting patch was positively correlated with effective population size, but not with other estimators of genetic diversity. We detected a positive trend between geographic distance and genetic differentiation between nest aggregations. Our landscape genetic models suggest that increased urbanization is likely associated with higher levels of inbreeding. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of density and distribution of suitable nesting patches for enhancing bee population abundance and connectivity in human dominated habitats and highlights the critical contribution of landscape genetic studies for enhanced conservation and management of native pollinators. © 2015 López-Uribe et al.",Article,Scopus

Recent laboratory and semi-field studies on colony-level effects of neonicotinoids assumed exclusive or near-exclusive levels of colony foraging on a treated crop. But is this a realistic assumption? Six honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies were monitored over two springs (April-May 2011/12) in two neighbouring locations (urban and rural) in and near Brighton, UK, to quantify foraging on oilseed rape, the most widespread bee-attractive crop in the UK, by decoding waggle dances and trapping pollen. The study area was representative of the UK agricultural landscape in that the percentage area cover of the blooming oilseed rape fields around the rural location was similar to the national average (3.3-3.9% vs 3.1%). The amount of foraging on oilseed rape fields, as indicated by dance decoding, was variable, but low, 0-0.02% for the urban and 2-26% for the rural location. Almost all foraging, 91-99%, was within 2. km, even though honey bees can forage at distances of over 10. km. Pollen trapping in 2012 supported the dance decoding results, with oilseed rape pollen comprising 14% of pollen pellets collected by foragers from rural and 4% from urban hives.

Honeybees and bumblebees are agriculturally important pollinators for whom the effects of stress are extremely relevant. These pollinators are often transported long distances during which colonies experience severe physical disturbance, causing stress to individuals prior to their release for pollination. Under natural foraging conditions, bees are excellent at learning about the flowers they forage from, including associations between floral stimuli and rewards. However, it is not clear how stress might affect bees' abilities to learn and remember floral features. Here we address the effects of acute stress on learning and memory in the bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. Using the Proboscis Extension Response (PER) protocol, we look at stress effects on learning and memory in three experiments. After being trained to a conditioned stimulus, we addressed: (1) the effect of 24. h and (2) 30. min of stress on the recall of this learned association and (3) the effect of stress on subsequently learning an association. We found that 24. h of stress after learning appeared to improve memory recall, and there was a trend in the same direction for 30. min of stress. However, bees that were stressed prior to learning an association did not differ from unstressed bees in their ability to learn or remember an association. Our finding that stress has effects on memory in the bumblebee could have implications for their use in behavioral experiments and for promoting the success of both managed and wild populations. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus

Social hymenopteran foragers make good models for studying search patterns because their only role is to search for food and bring it back to the nest or hive. Search patterns in ants and bees, the most studied social hymenopterans, consist of loops around the origin of search that expand in size as the search goes on. Different factors influence search structure, including the type and distribution of the resource that is targeted, and the kind and amount of information available for navigation. In the distributions of the lengths of search segments, bees exhibit a Lévy walk pattern, which follows a power law in which occasional long segments are interspersed within many short segments, and yet longer segments are interspersed within the long segments. Such a scale-free and heavy-tailed distribution has been shown to be optimal in searching for sparse targets. Ants on the other hand show a composite Brownian search distribution, composed of two exponential distributions at different scales. We argue that such composite Brownian searches serve to approximate a Lévy walk.

Given that a large number of species are rare, threatened, or endangered, and the entire family is included in Appendix II of CITES, the limited knowledge about their reproductive biology is of major concern. Mammillaria pectinifera is an endangered, small, globose cactus endemic to the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán region in Central Mexico. We aimed to characterize some basic aspects of its reproductive biology in three populations. We described flower morphology and anthesis, identified floral visitors, and evaluated the occurrence of spontaneous self-fertilization and the success of open pollination. Diurnal anthesis in flowers lasted about 4h/day and almost all flowers lasted only one day after opening. The analyses of variance revealed differences in flower morphology among populations. Herkogamy was positive and significantly different among populations. Field experiments revealed that open-pollinated flowers were highly successful in setting fruits and seeds. These results corroborate those reported in other Mammillaria species. Autonomous self-pollination was negligible and ineffective. Bees of the genus Ceratina were dominant among the captured flower visitors, and estimations of their maximum foraging distance indicated successful outcrossing in plants. This study indicates almost complete dependency of M.pectinifera on pollinators for fruits and seeds production. Our results serve as a basis for future research on reproductive biology of M.pectinifera and other rare and endangered cacti. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Complexity results from behavioural responses to external stimuli but can also arise spontaneously in their absence. Drawing on theoretical arguments about decision-making circuitry, we predict that the spontaneous patterns will be scale-free and universal, being independent of taxon and mode of locomotion. To test this hypothesis, we examined the activity patterns of the European honeybee, and multiple species of noctuid moth, tethered to flight mills and exposed to minimal external cues. We also reanalysed pre-existing data for Drosophila flies walking in featureless environments. Across these species, we found evidence of common scale-invariant properties in their movement patterns; pause and movement durations were typically power law distributed over a range of scales and characterized by exponents close to 3/2. Our analyses are suggestive of the presence of a pervasive scale-invariant template for locomotion which, when acted on by environmental cues, produces the movements with characteristic scales observed in nature. Our results indicate that scale-finite complexity as embodied, for instance, in correlatedrandom walk models, may be the result of environmental cues overriding innate behaviour, and that scale-free movements may be intrinsic and not limited to ‘blind’ foragers as previously thought. ©2015 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

Some members of the company or colony prospect for valuable liquid resources. When these are discovered other group members can be recruited to exploit the resource. The recruitment of nestmates to a specific location where there is a patch of flowers should change the economics of scouting, that is, the search for new resource patches. In particular, communication is predicted to make scouting at longer distances worthwhile because a profitable resource patch, once discovered, will enhance the foraging not only of the discoverer but also of nestmates that can be directed to the patch. By virtue of having large colonies and dance communication, honey bees are predicted to be able to profitably scout, and hence forage, at greater distances from the nest than either solitary bees or social bees without communication. We test this hypothesis by first examining existing data on foraging distance to evaluate whether honey bees do indeed forage at greater distances than other bees given their body size. Second, we present a simple cost-benefit analysis of scouting which indicates that communication causes longer range scouting to be more profitable. Overall, our analyses are supportive, but not conclusive, that honey bees forage further than would be expected given their size and that the waggle dance is a cause of the honey bee's exceptional foraging range. © 2015 Ratnieks and Shackleton.",Review,Scopus

(1) Short-range flights are likely to be related to learning the specific features of the hive's immediate surroundings, and were performed significantly more frequently under unfavourable weather conditions. (2) The duration of long-range orientation flights declined from the first to the fourth flight because the bees spent less time inspecting the immediate surroundings of the hive.

In this study, we investigated (1) pollinator nest distributions and estimated colony abundances, (2) the relationship between abundances of foraging workers and the number of nests they represent, (3) pollinator foraging ranges, and (4) the relationship between pollinator abundance and plant reproduction. We examined these questions in an alpine ecosystem in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, focusing on four alpine bumble bee species ( Bombus balteatus, B. flavifrons, B. bifarius, and B. sylvicola), and two host plants that differ in their degrees of pollinator specialization ( Trifolium dasyphyllum and T. parryi ). Using microsatellites, we found that estimated colony abundances among Bombus species ranged from ∼18 to 78 colonies/0.01 km2. The long-tongued species B. balteatus was most common, especially high above treeline, but the subalpine species B. bifarius was unexpectedly abundant for this elevation range. Nests detected among sampled foragers of each species were correlated with the number of foragers caught. Foraging ranges were smaller than expected for all Bombus species, ranging from 25 to 110 m. Fruit set for the specialized plant, Trifolium parryi, was positively related to the abundance of its Bombus pollinator. In contrast, fruit set for the generalized plant, T. dasyphyllum, was related to abundance of all Bombus species. Because forager abundance was related to nest abundance of each Bombus species and was an equally effective predictor of plant fecundity, forager inventories are probably suitable for assessing the health of outcrossing plant populations. However, nest abundance, rather than forager abundance, better reflects demographic and genetic health in populations of eusocial pollinators such as bumble bees. Development of models incorporating the parameters we have measured here (nest abundance, forager abundance, and foraging distance) could increase the usefulness of foraging worker inventories in monitoring, managing, and conserving pollinator populations. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus

The invasive species may thus be released from biotic interactions that can be a major source of density-dependent mortality, referred to as enemy release. We examined for evidence of enemy release in populations of the common wasp (Vespula vulgaris), which attains high densities and represents a major threat to biodiversity in its invaded range. Mass spectrometry prote-omic methods were used to compare the microbial communities in wasp populations in the native (Belgium and England) and invaded range (Argentina and New Zealand). We found no evidence of enemy release, as the number of microbial taxa was similar in both the introduced and native range. However, some evidence of distinctiveness in the microbial communities was observed between countries. The pathogens observed were similar to a variety of taxa observed in honey bees. These taxa included Nosema, Paenibacillus, and Yersina spp. Genomic methods confirmed a diversity of Nosema spp., Actinobacteria, and the Deformed wing and Kashmir bee viruses. We also analysed published records of bacteria, viruses, nematodes and fungi from both V. vulgaris and the related invader V. germanica. Thirty-three different microorganism taxa have been associated with wasps including Kashmir bee virus and entomophagous fungi such as Aspergillus flavus. There was no evidence that the presence or absence of these microorganisms was dependent on region of wasp samples (i.e. their native or invaded range). Given the similarity of the wasp pathogen fauna to that from honey bees, the lack of enemy release in wasp populations is probably related to spill-over or spill-back from bees and other social insects. Social insects appear to form a reservoir of generalist parasites and pathogens, which makes the management of wasp and bee disease difficult. © 2015 Lester et al.",Article,Scopus

However, little evidence is available on how and to what extent the pollen carryover affects the pollen-donor composition and on which insect taxa are effective outcross-pollen transporters under field conditions. In this study, we explored roles of foraging behavior of insect pollinators on pollen-donor composition and subsequent reproductive success in a woody plant. Methods We performed paternity analyses based on microsatellite genotyping of individual pollen grains found on diurnal pollinators (i.e., bumblebee, small bee, fly, small beetle, and honeybee) visiting Castanea crenata trees. Results The outcross-pollen rate was highest in bumblebees (66%), followed by small bees (35%), flies (31%), and small beetles (18%). The effective number of pollen donors, representing pollen carryover, was greater in bumblebees (9.71) than in flies (3.40), small bees (3.32), and small beetles (3.06). The high percentages of pollen from outside the plot on bumblebees (65.4%) and flies (71.2%) compared to small bees (35.3%) and small beetles (13.5%) demonstrated their longer pollen dispersal distances. Conclusions All of the diurnal insects carried outcross-pollen grains for long distances via pollen carryover.

Various endpoints of colony performance and foraging behavior were measured during and after exposure, including winter survival. Imidacloprid residues became diluted or non-detectable within colonies due to the processing of beebread and honey and the rapid metabolism of the chemical. Imidacloprid exposure doses up to 100 μg/kg had no significant effects on foraging activity or other colony performance indicators during and shortly after exposure. Diseases and pest species did not affect colony health but infestations of Varroa mites were significantly higher in exposed colonies. Honey stores indicated that exposed colonies may have avoided the contaminated food. Imidacloprid dose effects was delayed later in the summer, when colonies exposed to 20 and 100 μg/kg experienced higher rates of queen failure and broodless periods, which led to weaker colonies going into the winter. Pooled over two years, winter survival of colonies averaged 85.7, 72.4, 61.2 and 59.2% in the control, 5, 20 and 100 μg/kg treatment groups, respectively. Analysis of colony survival data showed a significant dose effect, and all contrast tests comparing survival between control and treatment groups were significant, except for colonies exposed to 5 μg/kg. Given the weight of evidence, chronic exposure to imidacloprid at the higher range of field doses (20 to 100 μg/kg) in pollen of certain treated crops could cause negative impacts on honey bee colony health and reduced overwintering success, but the most likely encountered high range of field doses relevant for seed-treated crops (5 μg/kg) had negligible effects on colony health and are unlikely a sole cause of colony declines. © 2015, Public Library of Science.

The quantity of individual essential amino acids (EAAs) obtained from dietary protein depends on the protein source, but how the proportion of EAAs in the diet affects nutrient balancing has rarely been studied. Recent research using the Geometric Framework for Nutrition has revealed that forager honeybees who receive much of their dietary EAAs from floral nectar and not from solid protein have relatively low requirements for dietary EAAs. Here, we examined the nutritional requirements for protein and carbohydrates of foragers of the bufftailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris. By using protein (sodium caseinate) or an equimolar mixture of the 10 EAAs, we found that the intake target (nutritional optimum) of adult workers depended on the source and proportion of dietary EAAs. When bees consumed caseinate-containing diets in a range of ratios between 1:250 and 1:25 (protein to carbohydrate), they achieved an intake target (IT) of 1:149 (w/w). In contrast to those fed protein, bees fed the EAA diets had an IT more biased towards carbohydrates (1:560 w/w) but also had a greater risk of death than those fed caseinate. We also tested how the dietary source of EAAs affected free AAs in bee haemolymph. Bees fed diets near their IT had similar haemolymph AA profiles, whereas bees fed diets high in caseinate had elevated levels of leucine, threonine, valine and alanine in the haemolymph. We found that like honeybees, bumblebee workers prioritize carbohydrate intake and have a relatively low requirement for protein. The dietary source of EAAs influenced both the ratio of protein/EAA to carbohydrate and the overall amount of carbohydrate eaten. Our data support the idea that EAAs and carbohydrates in haemolymph are important determinants of nutritional state in insects. © 2015. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Studies on the dance precision of Apis mellifera have shown that the dance is often imprecise. Two hypotheses have been put forward aimed at explaining this imprecision. The first argues that imprecision in the context of foraging is adaptive as it ensures that the dance advertises the same patch size irrespective of distance. The second argues that the bees are constrained in their ability to be more precise, especially when the source is nearby. Recent studies have found support for the latter hypothesis but not for the ""tuned-error"" hypothesis, as the adaptive hypothesis became known. Here we investigate intra-dance variation among Apis species. We analyse the dance precision of A. florea, A. dorsata, and A. mellifera in the context of foraging and swarming. A. mellifera performs forage dances in the dark, using gravity as point of reference, and in the light when dancing for nest sites, using the sun as point of reference. Both A. dorsata and A. florea are open-nesting species; they do not use a different point of reference depending on context. A. florea differs from both A. mellifera and A. dorsata in that it dances on a horizontal surface and does not use gravity but instead ""points"" directly toward the goal when indicating direction. Previous work on A. mellifera has suggested that differences in dance orientation and point of reference can affect dance precision. We find that all three species improve dance precision with increasing waggle phase duration, irrespective of differences in dance orientation, and point of reference. When dancing for sources nearby, dances are highly variable. When the distance increases, dance precision converges. The exception is dances performed by A. mellifera on swarms. Here, dance precision decreases as the distance increases. We also show that the size of the patch advertised increases with increasing distance, contrary to what is predicted under the tuned-error hypothesis. © 2015 Beekman, Makinson, Couvillon, Preece and Schaerf.",Article,Scopus

Whether compensation is possible will depend on functional diversity in the wild bee community and on the distribution of habitat and resources within the landscape surrounding an orchard that affect wild bee abundance. We studied pollination services and bee functional diversity in 20 apple orchards in southern Quebec, Canada. We evaluated pollinator efficacy by studying: apple visitation rates, approach (front or side-working), body size, foraging type (pollen or nectar foraging), sociality, temporal and climatic activity patterns, and pollen carrying habit. Pollination services were measured as apple fruit set and seed set. A distance-based measure of functional diversity, calibrated with bee traits and weighted by species relative abundance in the wild bee community, was used to model pollination services. We correlated the landscape composition and configuration of surrounding natural (forest) and semi-natural (meadow) habitats with bee diversity and pollination services. The incidence of fruit set and seed set in orchards increased with bee functional diversity. Complementarity between managed versus unmanaged bees in traits associated with foraging and resource use drove this relationship. Seed set was also negatively correlated with both the mean distance from surrounding meadows and the total area of surrounding orchards. Bee functional diversity was positively associated with surrounding meadow and forest area. These two land classes complement each other in their seasonal provision of foraging resources for bees. Our models can be used to prescribe management and conservation objectives for bee habitat management that promote pollination services.

The absence of morphological diagnostic characters for the identification of some species creates difficulties for basic ecological studies, and for conservation management. The widespread and commercially exploited bumblebee subgenus Bombus sensu stricto contains a cryptic species complex, known as the lucorum complex, which in Europe comprises B. lucorum, B. cryptarum and B. magnus. Little is known about these species and much of what has been reported is likely to have suffered from incorrect identification. Although the lucorum complex as a whole is common in Great Britain, we aimed to determine whether the populations of the individual species are vulnerable and require conservation action. Using genetic methods to distinguish them, we determined the geographic distribution and abundance of the lucorum complex species in Great Britain, and assessed the extent of niche differentiation between these species. We detected major differences in the geographic range, forage use and sensitivity to summer temperatures of the three species. Bombus lucorum was found to have the broadest distribution and diet, being present throughout mainland Great Britain, whereas B. cryptarum and B. magnus were absent from large areas of central and southern England. Bombus cryptarum and B. magnus were more likely to be found at sites with lower summer temperatures.

Initially, different groups of bees dance to represent different potential sites, but eventually the swarm usually reaches an agreement for only one site. Here, we model the nest-site selection process in honeybee swarms of Apis mellifera and show how the swarms make adaptive decisions based on a trade-offbetween the quality and distance to candidate nest sites. We use bifurcation analysis and stochastic simulations to reveal that the swarm's site distance preference is moderate>near>far when the swarms choose between low quality sites. However, the distance preference becomes near>moderate>far when the swarms choose between high quality sites. Our simulations also indicate that swarms with large population size prefer nearer sites and, in addition, are more adaptive at making decisions based on available information compared to swarms with smaller population size. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Amongst other plants, over 600 species of orchids are exclusively pollinated by the bees during their quest for volatiles. Since the plants usually have a scattered distribution, it is assumed that orchid bees can transport the pollinaria across several kilometres due to their flight capabilities and a high dispersal potential. Until now, very long-range flight distances (up to 45 km) of male orchid bees have only been indirectly inferred from habitat requirements of orchids whose pollinaria were carried by captured males, whereas the distances established by direct measures (mark and recapture, radio telemetry) only span distances of up to around 6 km. The discrepancy between inferred and proven distances led us to readdress the question of dispersal ability of male orchid bees. In this study, we used tag, scratch and chemical marking of large numbers of bees to clarify two aspects: (1) the effect of moderate natural obstacles on dispersal and (2) the possibility of very long-range movements across a terrain lacking such obstacles. Our results suggest that a moderate natural obstacle (a valley separating opposite ridges) does not restrain orchid bee movements.

These may benefit bees by providing abundant forage, but may cause harm if the fields are treated with insecticides. Here, we investigated the potential exposure of honeybee colonies to pesticides in flowering oilseed rape (OSR) in England using a combination of aerial photographs and geographical modelling. Aerial photographs were used to detect and map fields of blooming OSR in eight 20 × 20 kilometers2 areas across England where OSR is grown. We determined the distance to the nearest OSR field for randomly chosen positions (i.e., potential hive locations) using a digital map made of each area. The proportion of colonies within foraging range to the nearest OSR field in each area was then calculated using published data on honeybee foraging distances obtained by waggle dance decoding. We found that the distribution of distances to the nearest OSR field varied greatly among study areas, ranging from almost all colonies being within range to almost all being out of range (6–79% were within median foraging distance). In one study area, we examined changes over a 4-year period and found little year-to-year variation due to crop rotation (23–36% within median foraging distance).

The abundance of small bees declined rapidly with increasing distance from areas of high density nesting; declining more rapidly than might be expected from uniform dispersal into the surrounding landscape.

The patterns of a waggle dance contain both distance and directional information. Nevertheless, the dance varies depending on the context in which it is performed; absconding, swarming, or foraging. This study is an extension of the study by Duangphakdee, Radloff, Pirk, and Hepburn (2009), who investigated whether the sun’s azimuth (altitude angle of the sun) affected Apis florea F. absconding waggle dances and what effect this had on colony decision-making and behavior. In this study, we add flight and foraging activities to the absconding data from Duangphakdee, Radloff, Pirk, and Hepburn (2009) and tested what effects, if any, the altitude angle had on other behavior and activities both at colony and individual levels. We report the number of waggle dances performed per unit time by A. florea foragers from 07:00 to 17:00 h. The mean frequency distribution of the number of foragers dancing showed a clear-cut trough between 12:00 and 13:00 h. The angular deviation in the run portion of the waggle dances increased significantly by 7° between 12:00 and 13:00 h relative to dance angles recorded prior to or post the noon period. We suggest that the imprecision of forager waggle dances, for an hour around noon, is caused by the honeybees’ difficulty in determining the location of the sun’s azimuth, as was shown by Duangphakdee, Radloff, Pirk, and Hepburn (2009) in A. florea scout dances over the noon period. Colony-based decision-making relies heavily upon the precision of waggle dances, especially when a major event such as absconding or swarming occurs; based on accurate dance information, the colony prepares to move its stores and synchronize its relocation as a cohesive unit to the new nest site. However, decision-making by foragers on an individual level was not negatively affected by the inaccuracy of the waggle dances performed during the noon period, nor did it affect the number of foragers in the field. © 2016 International Bee Research Association.",Article,Scopus

Any such differences will affect ecosystem assembly. Thus, it is important to understand why unequal dispersal rates might occur. Recent studies have indicated strong differences between forward and backward dispersal in two major bee groups, Hylaeinae and Allodapini. Here, we use a third bee group, tribe Ceratinini, to determine whether this might be a more general phenomenon. Location: Worldwide. Methods: Ceratinini is globally distributed (excepting Antarctica) and contains the single genus Ceratina and 21 subgenera, most of which are endemic to continents. We examined the phylogeny of Ceratinini using sequence data from three genes and 99 species, and inferred ancestral distributions using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. Results: We show that the tribe Ceratinini had an African origin in the early Eocene. This was followed by four dispersals out of Africa in the Eocene and early Oligocene and three further dispersals between the Miocene and the present. There has been no back-dispersal of Ceratinini to Africa. The lack of back-dispersal cannot be explained by species abundance in non-African regions, and physical barriers to back-dispersal seem unlikely. Main conclusions: Our results are similar to findings for two other major bee groups and indicate that back-dispersal is very rare. It is unlikely that physical barriers can explain these patterns. However, dispersal patterns might be explained by assembly rules such as niche pre-emption or by reduced opportunities for escaping into enemy-free space. At a continental level, it is likely that the composition of bee fauna is more strongly influenced by very early dispersal events rather than by later physical barriers to dispersal. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Bumble bees are one of the most effective pollinators in both natural and cultivated landscapes, but are often the first to be extirpated in human-altered habitats. Yet, little is known about the role of natural and human-altered habitats in promoting or limiting bumble bee gene flow. In this study, I closely examine the genetic structure of the yellow-faced bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, across the southwestern US coast and find strong evidence that natural oceanic barriers, as well as contemporary human-altered habitats, limit bee gene flow. Heterozygosity and allelic richness were lower in island populations, while private allelic richness was higher in island populations compared to mainland populations. Genetic differentiation, measured for three indices across the 1000 km study region, was significantly greater than the null expectation (FST = 0.041, F'ST = 0.044 and Dest = 0.155) and correlated with geographic distance. Furthermore, genetic differentiation patterns were most strongly correlated with contemporary (2011) not past (2006, 2001) resistance maps calibrated for high dispersal limitation over oceans, impervious habitat and croplands. Despite the incorporation of dramatic elevation gradients, the analyses reveal that oceans and contemporary human land use, not mountains, are the primary dispersal barriers for B. vosnesenskii gene flow. These findings reinforce the importance of maintaining corridors of suitable habitat across the distribution range of native pollinators to promote their persistence and safeguard their ability to provide essential pollination services. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,Scopus

The perceptual distance between the colours of each pair was similar according to the CH model but varied widely according to the COC and RN models. The time that bees required to select a flower and the proportion of correct choices differed between groups: decision times decreased as achromatic contrast increased, and the proportion of correct choices increased with achromatic contrast and perceptual distance, as predicted by the COC and RN models. These results suggest that both chromatic and achromatic contrasts affected the discriminability of colour pairs.

The basis of such approach depends on a set of features extracted from all the classes and using them to train a classifier and then use it to determine the class to which the unseen data belongs to, with a reasonable accuracy. Hence the performance of the classifier depends on the features' ability to discriminate between the good or normal and the defects. Therefore, one way of improving the classifier is to select the most appropriate features from a given feature set for the purpose of training and testing so that, at the end, better results can be achieved overall. In this paper, a novel wrapper-based feature selection approach using Bees Algorithm for the application of wood defect classification is presented. Bees Algorithm is a swarm-based optimisation technique mimicking the foraging behaviour of honey bees found in nature. In order to demonstrate the wrapper-based feature selection procedure a Minimum Distance Classifier (MDC) is used in this study. However, the method can be applied to any application using some other classifier. The study shows that, on average, a 10% improvement is achieved when a reduced sub-set of 12 features selected using the proposed wrapper-based method with Bees Algorithm is used in training and testing the MDC when compared to using the original full set of 17 features.

We counted the foragers that a colony allocated to each of nine feeders containing 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 M sucrose solution [31, 43, and 55% sucrose (wt/wt), respectively] at distances of 10, 15, and 20 m from the nest.

At the 10-m feeders, 4.9-fold more foragers visited 2.0 M as compared to 1.0 M sucrose feeders. Colony forager allocation thus responded to both differences in food distance and quality even when the travel cost was negligible compared to normal colony foraging distances (10 m vs. an estimated 800-1 710 m).

In this study, we investigated the impact of past climate, and also the potential impact of host plant species abundance, on intraspecific genetic variation in three codistributed and related specialized solitary bees of the genus Melitta with very similar life history traits and dispersal capacities. We sequenced five independent loci in samples collected from the three species. Our analyses revealed that the species associated with the most abundant host plant species (Melitta leporina) displays unusually high genetic variation, to an extent that is seldom reported in phylogeographic studies of animals and plants. This suggests a potential role of food resource abundance in determining current patterns of genetic variation in specialized herbivorous insects. Patterns of genetic variation in the two other species indicated lower overall levels of diversity, and that M. nigricans could have experienced a recent range expansion. Ecological niche modelling of the three Melitta species and their main host plant species suggested a strong reduction in range size during the last glacial maximum. Comparing observed sequence data with data simulated using spatially explicit models of coalescence suggests that M. leporina recovered a range and population size close to their current levels at the end of the last glaciation, and confirms recent range expansion as the most likely scenario for M. nigricans.

Over the past several decades, multiple species of bumble bees have experienced declines in both geographic range and abundance in Europe and North America, while 4 species of the genus Bombus (Bombus) have suffered dramatic declines in the United States. Such declines are not as evident in Alaska, and the status of Bombus remains relatively unknown in the adjacent territories of Canada. To begin addressing this knowledge gap, we sampled the bumble bee fauna foraging on floral patches along 5 highways of Canada and southeastern Alaska in a short-term, one-time survey during late summer 2010. We observed 14 species and found Bombus assemblages to be structured by broad geographic features and ecoregions. The Bombus species B. (B.) occidentalis and B.

Here, we investigate the effects of patch size on insect visitation in patches of smaller area (range c. 0.1-3.1m2), which are of particular relevance to ornamental flower beds in parks and gardens. We studied two common garden plant species in full bloom with 6 patch sizes each: borage (Borago officinalis) and lavender (Lavandula×intermedia 'Grosso'). We quantified flower visitation by insects by making repeated counts of the insects foraging at each patch. On borage, all insects were honey bees (Apis mellifera, n=5506 counts). On lavender, insects (n=737 counts) were bumble bees (Bombus spp., 76.9%), flies (Diptera, 22.4%), and butterflies (Lepidoptera, 0.7%). On both plant species we found positive linear effects of patch size on insect numbers. However, there was no effect of patch size on the number of insects per unit area or per flower and, on lavender, for all insects combined or only bumble bees. The results show that it is possible to make unbiased comparisons of the attractiveness of plant species or varieties to flower-visiting insects using patches of different size within the small scale range studied and make possible projects aimed at comparing ornamental plant varieties using existing garden flower patches of variable area. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Article,Scopus

The same set of secretory cells expresses different genes or proteins to create these age-dependent changes; however, it is unknown precisely how the phosphorylation network regulates physiological differences across the development of the adult worker HG. We employed high-accuracy mass-spectrometry-based proteomics to survey phosphoproteome changes in the newly emerged, nurse, and forager bees. Overall, 941, 1322, and 1196 phosphorylation sites matching 1007, 1353, and 1199 phosphopeptides from 549, 720, and 698 phosphoproteins were identified in the three ages of the HG, respectively. Specialized, interconnected phosphorylation networks within each age were found by comparing protein abundance and phosphorylation levels. This illustrates that many proteins are regulated by phosphorylation independent of their expression levels. Furthermore, proteins in key biological processes and pathways were dynamically phosphorylated with age development, including the centrosome cycle, mitotic spindle elongation, macromolecular complex disassembly, and ribosome, indicating that phosphorylation tunes protein activity to optimize cellular behavior of the HG over time. Moreover, complementary protein and phosphoprotein expression is required to support the unique physiology of secretory activity in the HG. This reported data set of the honeybee phosphoproteome significantly improves our understanding of a range of regulatory mechanisms controlling a variety of cellular processes and will serve as a valuable resource for those studying the honeybee and other insects. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",Article,Scopus

Our working hypothesis is that within specialized mutualistic interactions, where each species relies on the co-occurrence of the other for survival and/or reproduction, partners are expected to show congruent evolutionary trajectories, because they are likely to have followed parallel migration routes and to have shared glacial refugia. Location: Western Palaearctic. Methods: Our analysis relies on the extensive sampling of 104 Western Palaearctic populations (totalling 434, 159 and 74 specimens of Lysimachia vulgaris, Macropis europaea and Macropis fulvipes, respectively), genotyped with amplified fragment length polymorphism. Based on this, we evaluated the regional genetic diversity (Shannon diversity and allele rarity index) and genetic structure (assessed using structure, population networks, isolation-by-distance and spatial autocorrelation metrics) of each species. Finally, we compared the general phylogeographical patterns obtained. Results: Contrary to our expectations, the analyses revealed phylogeographical signals suggesting that the investigated organisms demonstrate independent post-glacial trajectories as well as distinct contemporaneous demographic parameters, despite their mutualistic interaction. Main conclusions: The mutualistic partners investigated here are likely to be experiencing distinct and independent evolutionary dynamics because of their contrasting life-history traits (e.g. dispersal abilities), as well as distinct hubs and migration routes. Such conditions would prevent and/or erase any signature of co-structuring of lineages in space and time. As a result, the lack of phylogeographical congruence driven by differences in life-history traits might have arisen irrespective of the three species having shared similar Pleistocene glacial refugia. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,Scopus

The proposed methodology is developed on the basics of a new swarm based Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm combined with two-step constrained local search for neighborhood selection. VRPSTW involves computing the routes of a set of vehicles with fixed capacity from a central depot to a set of geographically dispersed customers with known demands and predefined time windows. Here, the time window constraints are relaxed into ""soft"", that is penalty terms are added to the solution cost whenever a vehicle serves a customer outside of his time window. The solution of routing problems with soft time windows has valuable practical applications. This paper uses a direct interpretation of the VRPSTW as a multi-objective optimization problem where the total traveling distance, number of window violations and number of required vehicles are minimized while capacity and time window constraints are met. Our work aims at using ABC inspired foraging behavior of honey bees which balances exploration and exploitation to avoid local optima and reach the global optima. The algorithm is applied to solve the well known benchmark Solomon's problem instances. Experimental results show that our suggested approach is quite effective, as it provides solutions that are competitive with the best known results in the literature. Finally, we present an analysis of our proposed algorithm in terms of computational time. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

In eusocial species, P450 expression varies with anatomy and age-related behaviour. Adult honeybees (Apis mellifera) possess appendages differentially equipped for chemoreception; antennae and prothoracic and mesothoracic legs assess food and pheromone signals whereas metathoracic legs transport pollen over long distances. Newly eclosed bees and nurses remain in the hive and neither gather nor process food, whereas foragers collect pollen and nectar, thereby encountering phytochemicals. To understand the functions of cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily G, polypeptide 11 (CYP4G11) in the honeybee genome, we compared its expression relative to worker age and task to expression of cytochrome P450, family 9, subfamily Q, polypeptides (CYP9Qs) known to metabolize xenobiotics. That CYP4G11 is highly expressed in forager antennae and legs, with highest expression in prothoracic and mesothoracic legs, is consistent with chemosensory perception, whereas weak expression of CYP4G11 in nurses suggests that it may process primarily exogenous rather than endogenous chemical signals. By contrast, and consistent with xenobiotic detoxification, the three CYP9Q transcripts were almost undetectable in newly eclosed workers and highest in foragers, with maximal expression in the metathoracic legs that closely contact pollen phytochemicals. These CYP4G11 expression patterns suggest a role in processing environmental signals, particularly those associated with food. © 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.",Article,Scopus

A number of agri-environment schemes have been implemented to halt and reverse these declines, predominantly revolving around the provision of additional forage plants. Although it has been demonstrated that these schemes can attract substantial numbers of foraging bumblebees, it remains unclear to what extent they actually increase bumblebee populations. We used standardized transect walks and molecular techniques to compare the size of bumblebee populations between Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) farms implementing pollinator-friendly schemes and Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) control farms. Bumblebee abundance on the transect walks was significantly higher on HLS farms than ELS farms. Molecular analysis suggested maximum foraging ranges of 566 m for Bombus hortorum, 714 m for B. lapidarius, 363 m for B. pascuorum and 799 m for B. terrestris. Substantial differences in maximum foraging range were found within bumblebee species between farm types. Accounting for foraging range differences, B. hortorum (47 vs 13 nests/km2) and B. lapidarius (45 vs 22 nests/km2) were found to nest at significantly greater densities on HLS farms than ELS farms. There were no significant differences between farm type for B. terrestris (88 vs 38 nests/km2) and B. pascuorum (32 vs 39 nests/km2). Across all bumblebee species, HLS management had a significantly positive effect on bumblebee nest density. These results show that targeted agri-environment schemes that increase the availability of suitable forage can significantly increase the size of wild bumblebee populations. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,Scopus

The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Native to Britain, O. sphegodes used to be more widely distributed throughout south-eastern England, but is now mainly restricted to the counties of Dorset, East Sussex and Kent. It is widespread throughout the western parts of central and southern Europe, and is common in Spain, France and Italy. Further east, it occurs in Bulgaria and Greece, including most of the Mediterranean islands, and extends into southern Russia, Turkey and northern Iran. Ophrys sphegodes grows on calcareous, nutrient-poor substrates and rarely under any shade. It is most common in ancient, heavily grazed grassland on chalk and Jurassic limestone, but it also occurs in disturbed habitats, horizontally oriented rock floors in limestone quarries, on old limestone quarry spoil heaps, and in lightly trampled calcareous grasslands on maritime cliffs. Ophrys sphegodes multiplies predominantly by sexual reproduction. Vegetative multiplication occasionally occurs through survival or splitting of the old tuber. In the UK, the species is almost exclusively pollinated by males of the solitary bee Andrena nigroaenea. Male bees are attracted by complex floral bouquets emitted by the flowers that strongly resemble pheromones produced by female A. nigroaenea. Fruit production is generally low, and in most populations, <15% of the flowers produce capsules. Ophrys sphegodes is reproductively isolated from other species in the genus by strong pre-mating barriers, most notably temporal (differences in flowering time) and floral (different pollinators) isolation. In particular, differences in floral odour appear to underlie floral isolation. Nonetheless, several hybrids involving O. sphegodes have been described in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. The range of O. sphegodes in Britain declined dramatically in the twentieth century, leading to its extinction in twelve vice-counties. Losses were mainly due to ploughing of grassland and changes in fertilizer and grazing regimes. Its range has increased somewhat in recent years. However, increases in spring temperature due to climate warming may seriously threaten the species in Britain by disrupting the close relationship between O. sphegodes flowering time and the phenology of flight of its prime pollinator, leading to reproductive failure. © 2015 British Ecological Society.",Article,Scopus

Nearby populations without any geographic barrier between them may also suffer from ecological isolation driven by habitat heterogeneity, which may promote divergence by local adaptation and drift. Likewise, elevation gradients may influence the genetic structure and diversity of populations, particularly those marginally distributed. Bathysa australis (Rubiaceae) is a widespread tree along the elevation gradient of the Serra do Mar, SE Brazil. This self-compatible species is pollinated by bees and wasps and has autochoric seeds, suggesting restricted gene dispersal. We investigated the distribution of genetic diversity in six B. australis populations at two extreme sites along an elevation gradient: a lowland site (80-216 m) and an upland site (1010-1100 m.a.s.l.). Nine microsatellite loci were used to test for genetic structure and to verify differences in genetic diversity between sites. We found a marked genetic structure on a scale as small as 6 km (F<inf>ST</inf> = 0.21), and two distinct clusters were identified, each corresponding to a site. Although B. australis is continuously distributed along the elevation gradient, we have not observed a gene flow between the extreme populations. This might be related to B. australis biological features and creates a potential scenario for adaptation to the different conditions imposed by the elevation gradient. We failed to find an isolation-by-distance pattern; although on the fine scale, all populations showed spatial autocorrelation until ~10-20 m. Elevation difference was a relevant factor though, but we need further sampling effort to check its correlation with genetic distance. The lowland populations had a higher allelic richness and showed higher rare allele counts than the upland ones. The upland site may be more selective, eliminating rare alleles, as we did not find any evidence for bottleneck.

Nonetheless, only few studies have been carried out with pollinators, usually emphasizing the honeybee Apis mellifera and neglecting other important pollinator species such as the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Here, lethal and sublethal effects of azadirachtin were studied on B. terrestris via oral exposure in the laboratory to bring out the potential risks of the compound to this important pollinator. The compound was tested at different concentrations above and below the maximum concentration that is used in the field (32 mg L−1). As most important results, azadirachtin repelled bumblebee workers in a concentration-dependent manner. The median repellence concentration (RC50) was estimated as 504 mg L−1. Microcolonies chronically exposed to azadirachtin via treated sugar water during 11 weeks in the laboratory exhibited a high mortality ranging from 32 to 100 % with a range of concentrations between 3.2 and 320 mg L−1. Moreover, no reproduction was scored when concentrations were higher than 3.2 mg L−1. At 3.2 mg L−1, azadirachtin significantly inhibited the egg-laying and, consequently, the production of drones during 6 weeks. Ovarian length decreased with the increase of the azadirachtin concentration. When azadirachtin was tested under an experimental setup in the laboratory where bumblebees need to forage for food, the sublethal effects were stronger as the numbers of drones were reduced already with a concentration of 0.64 mg L−1. Besides, a negative correlation was found between the body mass of male offspring and azadirachtin concentration. In conclusion, our results as performed in the laboratory demonstrated that azadirachtin can affect B. terrestris with a range of sublethal effects. Taking into account that sublethal effects are as important as lethal effects for the development and survival of the colonies of B. terrestris, this study confirms the need to test compounds on their safety, especially when they have to perform complex tasks such as foraging. The latter agrees with the recent European Food Safety Authority guidelines to assess ‘potentially deleterious’ compounds for sublethal effects on behavior. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Article,Scopus

Field margins are common linear structures in the agricultural landscape. In the present study, we evaluated the factors that exert an impact on the forage flora composition and on the diversity in field margins. The study was conducted in the 2010 - 2011 time period across the agricultural landscape on the Lublin Upland of SE Poland. Data on the forage flora were obtained while making floristic charts along 45 transect plots x 300 m; the total length being 13500 m. Multivariate ordination techniques (PCA and RDA) were employed to analyse forage-flora characteristics. Field margins represent valuable refuge areas for forage-species richness, but not for the abundance of forage species. On field margins, forage-species diversity benefits from the location of natural habitats (forests or meadows), primarily if the distance from these habitats is <1000 m or the field acreage is <10 ha. The shift from heterogeneous habitats to a more homogeneous landscape causes a reduction of forage floral diversity. Due to lack of dense forage-species patches, the promotion of sowing nectariferous and/or polleniferous species seems to be a reasonable management method to enhance the quantitative food niche on field margins and to support the conservation of pollinators in the areas surrounding farms. © 2015, J.

An entire range of flower visitors of this fruit plant was captured with hand net from its field and were identified. On the basis of foraging mode, the flower visitors were characterized as pollinators and non-pollinators. Their relative abundances, foraging rates, activity durations and number of pollen grains carried on the surface were recorded and these parameters were used to determine their pollinating efficiencies. During the two years of this study, a total of 12 insect species were observed on the three varieties of plum at Hisar. Among these insect visitors, five species belonged to Hymenoptera, five to Diptera, one to Lepidoptera and one to Coleoptera. Apis dorsata was the most abundant visitor having maximal foraging rate and carried maximal number of loose pollen grains and proved to be the most efficient pollinator of plum (P. domestica) in both the seasons followed by A. mellifera, A. cerana and A. florea; the dipterans were the least efficient pollinators of plum in both the years.

Coccinia species are dioecious creepers or climbers with simple or bifid tendrils that occupy a range of habitats from arid scrubland, woodlands to lowland rainforest and mist forest. The corolla of Coccinia species is sympetalous, usually pale yellow to orange, and 1 to 4.5 cm long. Pollination is by bees foraging for pollen or nectar. After pollination, the developing ovary often exhibits longitudinal mottling, which usually disappears during maturation. All species produce berries with a pericarp in reddish colors (orange-red through to scarlet red), hence the generic name. The globose to cylindrical fruits contain numerous grayish-beige flat to lenticular seeds. Chromosome numbers are 2n = 20, 24, and 22 + XX/XY.

These include pollinating insects such as bumblebees, for which positive effects of AES on abundance and species richness have been shown. However, there is a lack of evidence for effects of AES on reproduction of target species, at either local or landscape scales. We conducted a large-scale study across landscapes exhibiting a gradient of agricultural intensity to investigate the effects of a targeted flower mixture, sown in patches of three different sizes, on an index of the total biomass of bumblebee sexuals (males and queens) on replicated transects within each landscape. We used this index (MQ) as a measure of bumblebee reproduction. After controlling for floral density on transects, we found that MQ was significantly higher on sown flower patches than on conventionally managed control patches at local scales throughout the three-year study. While sown flower patches did not significantly increase MQ in surrounding landscapes, MQ was higher in landscapes surrounding larger (1. ha) than smaller (0.25. ha) sown patches. Our results suggest that, while responses of different bee species may vary depending on the plant species sown, targeted flower mixtures can enhance bumblebee reproduction by providing locally attractive forage resources to bumblebees of all castes and sexes from nests within foraging distance. If established at large enough scales, sown flower patches may lead to a detectable spill-over of reproductives into surrounding landscapes. Furthermore, effects of sown patches on MQ were moderated by landscape context, the strongest positive responses being detected at sites with high proportions of arable land. This supports previous findings that AES can deliver greater net benefits for pollinators in more intensively farmed landscapes. © 2015 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Article,Scopus

W. W. Smith, an alpine species endemic to NW Yunnan, China, was investigated between 2007 and 2008. Floral traits including flowering time, floral morphology, petal color, and floral scents were assessed, and the associated pollinator assemblage and their foraging behavior were recorded. The flowering period of R. cyanocarpum ranges from late March to middle May and a single flower can last 8-10 days in its natural habitat. Flowers generally show marked herkogamy and the protruding style encourages pollinator foraging behavior that counteracts self-pollination. Floral scents comprise mostly aliphatics (64.37%) and terpenoids (29.88%), which make the flowers attractive for several insect groups, but a peak at 430 nm in the reflectance spectrum of petals suggest selection for the attraction of bumblebees. The two Bombus species, B. festivus and B. richardsiellus, representing 90% of total recorded visits, were the only insect species that can be considered to effectively pollinate R. cyanocarpum. Pollination treatments indicated the general self-compatibility of R. cyanocarpum; however, outcrossing seemed to be the dominant strategy, with low rates of self-fertilization providing a certain level of reproductive assurance in its alpine habitat. © 2014 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Article,Scopus

The aim of this study is to elucidate the reproductive strategies of this heterostylous species in an alpine environment. Methods – Floral scents were assessed and the pollinator assemblage and their foraging behaviour were recorded. In addition, the breeding system was investigated during 2004 and 2005 in populations from the Yulong Shan range, Lijiang County of Yunnan Province, China. Key results – Limonene was the dominant floral scent compound, accounting for 41.2%, followed by α-pinene, diacetone alcohol and myrcene. Higher fruit and seed sets from inter-morph pollination were found compared to self, intra-morph and geitogamous pollination. Significant differences in seed set after self and open pollination were detected between flower morphs in both years. Two common insect species, the bumblebee Bombus lucorum and the butterfly Hypolimnas misippus, were the most important pollinators in the examined population, they visited the inflorescences 3.3 and 2.3 times per hour, respectively. Conclusion – beesiana is an obligate outcrosser, but with some self-compatibility. Seed set of selfpollinated pins was higher than that of thrums in both years, which seems to be related to this partial selfcompatibility, which is often ignored in distylous Primula species.

Patellapis doleritica is a recently described communally nesting halictid bee of conservation concern because it is rare and endemic to the Succulent Karoo of South Africa. Moreover, its dispersal is considered to be restricted by its specialised nesting requirements and inclement weather conditions during its limited annual flight period, traits which may be common to other bee species of the region. We hypothesised that gene flow in P. doleritica was low, leading to marked genetic differentiation. Using 7 microsatellites, we investigated its mating and population genetic structure in 258 individuals (171 females and 87 males) from 7 populations spanning most of its known range. Deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (F<inf>IS</inf> = + 0.254) suggested P. doleritica to be inbred, as in many other communal nesting bee species. Global F<inf>ST</inf> (0.028) and global G′<inf>ST</inf> (0.216) revealed modest but significant differentiation between most populations, even across the very limited range of the species (ca. 25 km), with one genetically extreme outlier population. Despite inbreeding, we detected a surprisingly low frequency of diploid males (2 %). Patellapis doleritica nevertheless deserves special conservation attention since it is an endemic species with a low overall abundance and therefore possibly prone to environmental change and local extinction. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Article,Scopus

A current frontier in community-level studies is the integration of these perspectives by investigating both simultaneously; one method for achieving this is evaluating the relative contributions of species turnover and host switching towards interaction turnover (i.e., the dissimilarity in interactions between two networks). We performed observations of plant-pollinator interactions to investigate (1) patterns in interaction turnover across spatial, temporal, and environmental gradients and (2) the relative contribution of pollinator species turnover, floral turnover, simultaneous pollinator & floral turnover, and host switching towards interaction turnover. Field work was conducted on the Beartooth Plateau, an alpine ecosystem in Montana and Wyoming, with weekly observations of plant-pollinator interactions across one growing season. Interaction turnover increased through time, with magnitudes consistently greater than 80%, even at time intervals as short as one week. Floral species turnover (41%) and simultaneous floral and pollinator species turnover (36%) accounted for almost all interaction turnover while host switching accounted for only 5%. Interaction turnover also significantly increased with spatial and elevational distance, albeit with lesser magnitudes than with temporal distance. The marginal spatial pattern was present for only some taxa (Bombus spp. and solitary bee species), potentially indicating variable habitat use by pollinators across the landscape. Weak environmental trends may be a consequence of unmeasured environmental variables, yet our finding that environmental gradients structure plant-pollinator interaction partitions had not previously been tested with empirical data. Our observations suggest that host switching does not readily occur at the scales of alpine flowering phenology (i.e., ;1 week); however, whether lack of host switching is indicative of inflexible pollinator foraging, or, more likely, a lack of opportunity or necessity to switch hosts, requires further investigation.

The sub-lethal impact of GLY on non-target organisms such as insect pollinators has not yet been evaluated. Apis mellifera is the main pollinator in agricultural environments and is a well-known model for behavioural research. Honeybees are also accurate biosensors of environmental pollutants and their appetitive behavioural response is a suitable tool with which to test sub-lethal effects of agrochemicals. We studied the effects of field-realistic doses of GLY on honeybees exposed chronically or acutely to the herbicide. We focused on sucrose sensitivity, elemental and non-elemental associative olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER), and foraging-related behaviour. We found a reduced sensitivity to sucrose and learning performance for the groups chronically exposed to GLY concentrations within the range of recommended doses. When olfactory PER conditioning was performed with sucrose reward with the same GLY concentrations (acute exposure), elemental learning and short-term memory retention decreased significantly compared with controls. Non-elemental associative learning was also impaired by an acute exposure to GLY traces. Altogether, these results imply that GLY at concentrations found in agro-ecosystems as a result of standard spraying can reduce sensitivity to nectar reward and impair associative learning in honeybees. However, no effect on foragingrelated behaviour was found. Therefore, we speculate that successful forager bees could become a source of constant inflow of nectar with GLY traces that could then be distributed among nestmates, stored in the hive and have long-term negative consequences on colony performance. © 2014.

Investigating the ecology of species with expanding ranges provides a potentially powerful means of elucidating these factors. Such species may also bring novel pollination services to their new ranges. We therefore investigated landscape-scale habitat use and foraging preferences of the Tree Bumblebee, B. hypnorum , a recent natural colonist that has rapidly expanded its range in the UK over the past decade. Counts of B. hypnorum and six other Bombus species were made in March-June 2012 within a mixed landscape in south-eastern Norfolk, UK. The extent of different landscape elements around each transect was quantified at three scales (250 m, 500 m and 1500 m). We then identified the landscape elements that best predicted the density of B. hypnorum and other Bombus species. At the best fitting scale (250 m), B. hypnorum density was significantly positively associated with extent of both urban and woodland cover and significantly negatively associated with extent of oilseed rape cover. This combination of landscape predictors was unique to B. hypnorum. Urban and woodland cover were associated with B. hypnorum density at three and two, respectively, of the three scales studied. Relative to other Bombus species, B. hypnorum exhibited a significantly higher foraging preference for two flowering trees, Crataegus monogyna and Prunus spinosa, and significantly lower preferences for Brassica napus , Glechoma hederacea and Lamium album. Our study provides novel, quantitative support for an association of B. hypnorum with urban and woodland landscape elements. Range expansion in B. hypnorum appears to depend, on exploitation of widespread habitats underutilised by native Bombus species, suggesting B. hypnorum will readily co-exist with these species. These findings suggest that management could target bumblebee species with distinctive habitat requirements to help maintain pollination services. © 2014 Crowther et al.",Article,Scopus

Colonies with typical honey bee depopulation symptoms were selected for multiple possible factors to reveal the causes of collapse. Results: Omnipresent were Nosema ceranae and Lake Sinai Virus. Moderate prevalences were found for Black Queen Cell Virus and trypanosomatids, whereas Deformed Wing Virus, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus strain Brookings and neogregarines were rarely detected. Other viruses, Nosema apis, Acarapis woodi and Varroa destructor were not detected. Palinologic study of pollen demonstrated that all colonies were foraging on wild vegetation. Consequently, the pesticide residue analysis was negative for neonicotinoids. The genetic analysis of trypanosomatids GAPDH gene, showed that there is a large genetic distance between Crithidia mellificae ATCC30254, an authenticated cell strain since 1974, and the rest of the presumed C. mellificae sequences obtained in our study or published. This means that the latter group corresponds to a highly differentiated taxon that should be renamed accordingly. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that the drivers of colony collapse may differ between geographic regions with different environmental conditions, or with different beekeeping and agricultural practices. The role of other pathogens in colony collapse has to bee studied in future, especially trypanosomatids and neogregarines.

Surprisingly, given the substantial price tag and mandatory EU member participation [2], there is either a lack of [1] or mixed [1, 2, 7] evidence-based support for the schemes. One novel source of data to evaluate AESs may be provided by an organism that itself may benefit from them. Honeybees (Apis mellifera), important pollinators for crops and wildflowers [8, 9], are declining in parts of the world from many factors, including loss of available forage from agricultural intensification [10-13]. We analyzed landscape-level honeybee foraging ecology patterns over two years by decoding 5,484 waggle dances from bees located in the center of a mixed, urban-rural 94 km2 area, including lands under government-funded AESs. The waggle dance, a unique behavior performed by successful foragers, communicates to nestmates the most profitable foraging locations [14-16]. After correcting for distance, dances demonstrate that honeybees possess a significant preference for rural land managed under UK Higher Level AESs and a significant preference against rural land under UK Organic Entry Level AESs. Additionally, the two most visited areas contained a National and Local Nature Reserve, respectively. Our study demonstrates that honeybees, with their great foraging range and sensitive response to forage quality, can be used as bioindicators to monitor large areas and provide information relevant to better environmental management.

At a landscape scale, bee communities are affected by habitat composition, anthropogenic land use, and fragmentation. However, little information is available on local-scale spatial distribution of bee communities within habitats that are uniform at the landscape scale. We studied a bee community along with floral and nesting resources over a 32 km2 area of uninterrupted Mediterranean scrubland. Our objectives were (i) to analyze floral and nesting resource composition at the habitat scale. We ask whether these resources follow a geographical pattern across the scrubland at bee-foraging relevant distances; (ii) to analyze the distribution of bee composition across the scrubland. Bees being highly mobile organisms, we ask whether bee composition shows a homogeneous distribution or else varies spatially. If so, we ask whether this variation is irregular or follows a geographical pattern and whether bees respond primarily to flower or to nesting resources; and (iii) to establish whether body size influences the response to local resource availability and ultimately spatial distribution. We obtained 6580 specimens belonging to 98 species. Despite bee mobility and the absence of environmental barriers, our bee community shows a clear geographical pattern. This pattern is mostly attributable to heterogeneous distribution of small (&lt;55 mg) species (with presumed smaller foraging ranges), and is mostly explained by flower resources rather than nesting substrates. Even then, a large proportion (54.8%) of spatial variability remains unexplained by flower or nesting resources. We conclude that bee communities are strongly conditioned by local effects and may exhibit spatial heterogeneity patterns at a scale as low as 500-1000 m in patches of homogeneous habitat. These results have important implications for local pollination dynamics and spatial variation of plant-pollinator networks. © 2014 Torné-Noguera et al.",Article,Scopus

We investigated the responses of bees to pollen and nectar rewards, and the effects of these rewards on pollen deposition and fecundity in the hermaphroditic succulent shrub Aloe tenuior. Self-pollinated plants failed to set fruit, but their ovules were regularly penetrated by self-pollen tubes, which uniformly failed to develop into seeds as expected from ovarian self-incompatibility (or strong early inbreeding depression). Bees consistently foraged for pollen during the morning and early afternoon, but switched to nectar in the late afternoon. As a consequence of this differential foraging, we were able to test the relative contribution to fecundity of pollen- versus nectar-collecting flower visitors. We exposed emasculated and intact flowers in either the morning or late afternoon to foraging bees and showed that emasculation reduced pollen deposition by insects in the morning, but had little effect in the afternoon. Despite the potential for self-pollination to result in ovule discounting due to late-acting self-sterility, fecundity was severely reduced in artificially emasculated plants. Although there were temporal fluctuations in reward preference, most bee visits were for pollen rewards. Therefore the benefit of providing pollen that is accessible to bee foragers outweighs any potential costs to fitness in terms of gender interference in this species. © 2014 Duffy et al.",Article,Scopus

Honey bees face many challenges, including an issue generally affecting wildlife: landscape changes have reduced flower-rich areas. One way to help is therefore to supplement with flowers, but when would this be most beneficial? We use the waggle dance, a unique behaviour in which a successful forager communicates to nestmates the location of visited flowers, to make a 2-year survey of food availability. We ""eavesdropped"" on 5097 dances to track seasonal changes in foraging, as indicated by the distance to which the bees as economic foragers will recruit, over a representative rural-urban landscape. In year 3, we determined nectar sugar concentration. We found that mean foraging distance/area significantly increase from springs (493 m, 0.8 km2) to summers (2156 m, 15.2 km2), even though nectar is not better quality, before decreasing in autumns (1275 m, 5.1 km2). As bees will not forage at long distances unnecessarily, this suggests summer is the most challenging season, with bees utilizing an area 22 and 6 times greater than spring or autumn.

The study shows that Ziziphus spina -christi, Acacia tortilis Prosopis cineraria, Citrus sp., Maerua crassifolia, and Prosopis juliflora constitute the chief nectar and pollen sources for honeybees in this area. Each plant source yields honey with specific biochemical characteristics. The identified pollen/nectar sources reflect a wide range of foraging plant species for honeybees and encompass sufficient potential for sustaining beekeeping ventures in Northern Oman. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Here, we evaluated the late summer flowering Cephalaria transsylvanica as suitable species for strips providing food for pollinators in paucity periods. C. transsylvanica showed no particular requirements in terms of seed germination and growth during summer. This plant had an excellent potential of self-seeding and competitiveness towards weed competitors. C. transsylvanica prevented from entomophilous pollination showed inbreeding depression, with a decrease in seed-set and accumulation of seed energy reserves. However, C. transsylvanica did not appear to be vulnerable in terms of pollination biology since it had a wide range of pollinators including bees, hoverflies and Lepidoptera. C. transsylvanica was visited mainly by honeybees and bumblebees and these latter pollinators increased their visits on C. transsylvanica flowers during early autumn. This plant may be useful as an abundant source of pollen during food paucity periods, such as autumn. We proposed C. transsylvanica for incorporation into flower strips to be planted in non-cropped farmlands in intensively managed agricultural areas as well as in proximity of beehives. The latter option may facilitate the honeybees collecting pollen and nectar for the colony, thereby ensuring robustness to overcome the winter season. © 2014 Benelli et al.",Article,Scopus

For organisms living in fragmented habitats, population persistence may depend on dispersal, which maintains gene flow among fragments and can prevent inbreeding within them. It is centrally important to understand patterns of dispersal for bees living in fragmented areas given the importance of pollination systems and recently documented declines in bee populations. We used population and landscape genetic techniques to characterize patterns of dispersal over a large fragmented area in southern Costa Rica for the orchid bee species Euglossa championi. First, we estimated levels of genetic differentiation among forest fragments as φ{symbol}PT, an analog to the traditional summary statistic FST, as well as two statistics that may more adequately represent levels of differentiation, G'ST and Dest. Second, we used a Bayesian approach to determine the number and composition of genetic groups in our sample. Third we investigated how genetic differentiation changes with distance. Fourth, we determined the extent to which deforested areas restrict dispersal. Finally, we estimated the extent to which there were temporal differences in allele frequencies within the same forest fragments. Within years we found low levels of differentiation even over 80 km, and no effect of land use type on level of genetic differentiation. However, we found significant genetic differentiation between years. Taken together our results suggest that there are high levels of gene flow over this geographic area, and that individuals show low site fidelity over time. © 2014 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.",Article,Scopus

Such social learning might be explained by relatively simple associative learning mechanism: the bee may learn to associate conspecifics with nectar or pollen reward through previous experience of foraging jointly. However, in some studies, observers were guided by choices of 'demonstrators' viewed through a screen, so no reward was given to the observers at the time of seeing other bees' flowers choice and no demonstrator bee was present at the moment of decision. This behaviour, referred to observational conditioning, implies an additional associative step as the positive value of conspecific is transferred to the associated flower. Here we explore the role of demonstrator movement, and the distance between observers and demonstrators that is required for observation conditioning to take place. Methodology/Principal Findings: We identify the conditions under which observational conditioning occurs in the widespread European species Bombus terrestris. The presence of artificial demonstrator bees leads to a significant change in individual colour preference toward the indicated colour if demonstrators were moving and observation distance was limited (15 cm), suggesting that observational conditioning could only influence relatively short-range foraging decisions. In addition, the movement of demonstrators is a crucial factor for observational conditioning, either due to the more life-like appearance of moving artificial bees or an enhanced detectability of moving demonstrators, and an increased efficiency at directing attention to the indicated flower colour. Conclusion: Bumblebees possess the capacity to learn the quality of a flower by distal observation of other foragers' choices. This confirms that social learning in bees involves more advanced processes than simple associative learning, and indicates that observational conditioning might be widespread in pollinating insects, raising intriguing questions for the underlying mechanisms as well as the spread of social information in pollinator-plant interactions. © 2014 Avarguès-Weber, Chittka.",Article,Scopus

Several studies have previously shown that pollination services are greater in crops adjoining forest patches or other seminatural habitats than in crops completely surrounded by other crops. In this study, we investigated the specific importance of forest edges in providing potential pollinators in B. napus fields in two areas in France. Bees were caught with yellow pan traps at increasing distances from both warm and cold forest edges into B. napus fields during the blooming period. A total of 4594 individual bees, representing six families and 83 taxa, were collected. We found that both bee abundance and taxa richness were negatively affected by the distance from forest edge. However, responses varied between bee groups and edge orientations. The ITD (Inter-Tegular distance) of the species, a good proxy for bee foraging range, seems to limit how far the bees can travel from the forest edge. We found a greater abundance of cuckoo bees (Nomada spp.) of Andrena spp. and Andrena spp. males at forest edges, which we assume indicate suitable nesting sites, or at least mating sites, for some abundant Andrena species and their parasites (Fig. ). Synthesis and Applications. This study provides one of the first examples in temperate ecosystems of how forest edges may actually act as a reservoir of potential pollinators and directly benefit agricultural crops by providing nesting or mating sites for important early spring pollinators. Policy-makers and land managers should take forest edges into account and encourage their protection in the agricultural matrix to promote wild bees and their pollination services. © 2014 The Authors.

Understanding national patterns in the spatial structure of natural pest control and pollination can be used to promote effective crop management and contribute to long-term food security. We mapped the species richness and functional diversity of ground beetles and bees to provide surrogate measures of natural pest control and pollination for Great Britain. Functional diversity represents the value and range of morphological and behavioural traits that support ecosystem services. We modelled the rate at which functional diversity collapsed in response to species extinctions to provide an index of functional redundancy. Deficits in functional diversity for both pest control and pollination were found in areas of high arable crop production. Ground beetle functional redundancy was positively correlated with the landscape cover of semi-natural habitats where extinctions were ordered by body size and dispersal ability. For bees, functional redundancy showed a weak positive correlation with semi-natural habitat cover where species extinctions were ordered by feeding specialization. Synthesis and applications. Increasingly, evidence suggests that functionally diverse assemblages of ground beetles and bees may be a key element to strategies that aim to support pollination and natural pest control in crops. If deficits in both functional diversity and redundancy in areas of high crop production are to be reversed, then targeted implementation of agri-environment schemes that establish semi-natural habitat may provide a policy mechanism for supporting these ecosystem services. © 2013 The Authors.

While oligolectic species forage on pollen from a single family of host plants, polylectic bees, such as bumblebees, collect pollen from many families of plants. These polylectic species contend with interspecific variability in essential nutrients of their host-plants but we have only a limited understanding of the way in which chemicals and chemical combinations influence bee development and feeding behaviour. In this paper, we investigated five different pollen diets (Calluna vulgaris, Cistus sp., Cytisus scoparius, Salix caprea and Sorbus aucuparia) to determine how their chemical content affected bumblebee colony development and pollen/syrup collection. Three compounds were used to characterise pollen content: polypeptides, amino acids and sterols. Several parameters were used to determine the impact of diet on micro-colonies: (i) Number and weight of larvae (total and mean weight of larvae), (ii) weight of pollen collected, (iii) pollen efficacy (total weight of larvae divided by weight of the pollen collected) and (iv) syrup collection. Our results show that pollen collection is similar regardless of chemical variation in pollen diet while syrup collection is variable. Microcolonies fed on S. aucuparia and C. scoparius pollen produced larger larvae (i.e. better mates and winter survivors) and fed less on nectar compared to the other diets. Pollen from both of these species contains 24-methylenecholesterol and high concentrations of polypeptides/total amino acids. This pollen nutritional ""theme"" seems therefore to promote worker reproduction in B. terrestris micro-colonies and could be linked to high fitness for queenright colonies. As workers are able to selectively forage on pollen of high chemical quality, plants may be evolutionarily selected for their pollen content, which might attract and increase the degree of fidelity of generalist pollinators, such as bumblebees. © 2014 Vanderplanck et al.",Article,Scopus

The 'waggle' component of the dance (indicating directional information) contains an inherent error and this error becomes smaller the further the site danced for. The imprecision in the dance effectively spreads dance followers over a patch that remains relatively constant with increasing distance to a resource. This error has been proposed to be a colony-level adaptation and to confer an advantage in the context of foraging. An alternative explanation for the error in the bees' dance is that the bees simply cannot be more precise due to constraints inherent to the dance.

The crop contents of bees foraging on crape myrtle Lagerstroemia indica, which has no nectary, were larger than those foraging on nectar from other sources, confirming a previous finding that pollen foragers carry glue in addition to fuel honey from the hive.

This age-old disorder predates virtually all herbicides and pesticides, many diseases or pests and honey bee management protocols. To investigate possible involvement of a magnetoreception disorder (MRD) with loss of forager homing abilities: A. magnetized wires were glued to their abdomens; B. foragers were exposed to artificially induced fluctuating magnetic fields; and C. untreated foragers' return rates were monitored during naturally occurring disturbances to Earth's magnetosphere. Treated and untreated foragers were released at varying distances from their hives and their return rates were monitored. Significant differences in their return rates indicated that interactions existed between forager losses and exposure to both static and oscillating magnetic fields, as well as during fluctuations in the Earth's magnetosphere. In addition, D. decreases in untreated forager return rates also correlated with increasing intensity of extraterrestrial protons that entered Earth's atmosphere. Finally, winter colony losses in the northeast USA also correlated with annual geomagnetic storm occurrences. Collectively, these five observations indicate that coronal eruptions on the Sun are involved with interference of a forager's magnetoreception sense here on Earth.

Here, we review the available literature on insect telemetry using active (battery-powered) radio transmitters and compare this technology to harmonic radar and radio frequency identification (RFID) which use passive tags (i.e. without a battery). The first radio telemetry studies with insects were published in the late 1980s, and subsequent studies have addressed aspects of insect ecology, behaviour and evolution. Most insect telemetry studies have focused on habitat use and movement, including quantification of movement paths, home range sizes, habitat selection, and movement distances. Fewer studies have addressed foraging behaviour, activity patterns, migratory strategies, or evolutionary aspects. The majority of radio telemetry studies have been conducted outside the tropics, usually with beetles (Coleoptera) and crickets (Orthoptera), but bees (Hymenoptera), dobsonflies (Megaloptera), and dragonflies (Odonata) have also been radio-tracked. In contrast to the active transmitters used in radio telemetry, the much lower weight of harmonic radar and RFID tags allows them to be used with a broader range of insect taxa. However, the fixed detection zone of a stationary radar unit (< 1 km diameter) and the restricted detection distance of RFID tags (usually < 1-5 m) constitute major constraints of these technologies compared to radio telemetry. Most of the active transmitters in radio telemetry have been applied to insects with a body mass exceeding 1 g, but smaller species in the range 0.2-0.5 g (e.g. bumblebees and orchid bees) have now also been tracked. Current challenges of radio-tracking insects in the field are related to the constraints of a small transmitter, including short battery life (7-21 days), limited tracking range on the ground (100-500 m), and a transmitter weight that sometimes approaches the weight of a given insect (the ratio of tag mass to body mass varies from 2 to 100%). The attachment of radio transmitters may constrain insect behaviour and incur significant energetic costs, but few studies have addressed this in detail. Future radio telemetry studies should address (i) a larger number of species from different insect families and functional groups, (ii) a better coverage of tropical regions, (iii) intraspecific variability between sexes, ages, castes, and individuals, and (iv) a larger tracking range via aerial surveys with helicopters and aeroplanes equipped with external antennae. Furthermore, field and laboratory studies, including observational and experimental approaches as well as theoretical modelling, could help to clarify the behavioural and energetic consequences of transmitter attachment. Finally, the development of commercially available systems for automated tracking and potential future options of insect telemetry from space will provide exciting new avenues for quantifying movement and space use of insects from local to global spatial scales.

Patterns of dispersal and gene flow are key determinants of species' ability to respond to land-use change, but have been little investigated at a fine scale (&lt;10 km) in bumble bees. Using microsatellite markers, we determined the fine-scale spatial genetic structure of populations of four common Bombus species (B. terrestris, B. lapidarius, B. pascuorum and B. hortorum) and one declining species (B. ruderatus) in an agricultural landscape in Southern England, UK. The study landscape contained sown flower patches representing agri-environment options for pollinators. We found that, as expected, the B. ruderatus population was characterized by relatively low heterozygosity, number of alleles and colony density. Across all species, inbreeding was absent or present but weak (FIS = 0.01-0.02). Using queen genotypes reconstructed from worker sibships and colony locations estimated from the positions of workers within these sibships, we found that significant isolation by distance was absent in B. lapidarius, B. hortorum and B. ruderatus. In B. terrestris and B. pascuorum, it was present but weak; for example, in these two species, expected relatedness of queens founding colonies 1 m apart was 0.02. These results show that bumble bee populations exhibit low levels of spatial genetic structure at fine spatial scales, most likely because of ongoing gene flow via widespread queen dispersal. In addition, the results demonstrate the potential for agri-environment scheme conservation measures to facilitate fine-scale gene flow by creating a more even distribution of suitable habitats across landscapes. © 2014 The Authors.

Palaeoclimatic instability is a major mechanism of lineage diversification in taxa with low dispersal and small geographical ranges in tropical ecosystems. However, the impact of these climatic events remains questionable for the diversification of species with high levels of gene flow and large geographical distributions. In this study, we investigate the impact of Pleistocene climate change on three Neotropical orchid bee species (Eulaema bombiformis, E. meriana and E. cingulata) with transcontinental distributions and different physiological tolerances. We first generated ecological niche models to identify species-specific climatically stable areas during Pleistocene climatic oscillations. Using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear markers, we inferred calibrated phylogenies and estimated historical demographic parameters to reconstruct the phylogeographical history of each species. Our results indicate species with narrower physiological tolerance experienced less suitable habitat during glaciations and currently exhibit strong population structure in the mitochondrial genome. However, nuclear markers with low and high mutation rates show lack of association with geography. These results combined with lower migration rate estimates from the mitochondrial than the nuclear genome suggest male-biased dispersal. We conclude that despite large effective population sizes and capacity for long-distance dispersal, climatic instability is an important mechanism of maternal lineage diversification in orchid bees. Thus, these Neotropical pollinators are susceptible to disruption of genetic connectivity in the event of large-scale climatic changes. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,Scopus

We studied the spatial and temporal use of floral resources by bumble bees in a set of 30 local plant communities and used these data to model colony survival under different combinations of patch size and bumble bee flight distance. Floral resources vary spatially and temporally at the landscape level, and bumble bees track these resources across the landscape during the season. The simulation model showed that different patterns of resources availability could affect the survival and distribution of bumble bee nests across the landscape. This model can be used to generate hypotheses explaining bumble bee richness and abundance that can be tested in real landscapes.

They leave their nests to forage and routinely return to their home-base. Most are guided by memories of the visual panorama and the visual appearance of the local nest environment when pinpointing their nest. These memories are acquired during highly structured learning walks or flights that are performed when leaving the nest for the first time or whenever the insects had difficulties finding the nest during their previous return. Ground-nesting bees and wasps perform such learning flights daily when they depart for the first time. During these flights, the insects turn back to face the nest entrance and subsequently back away from the nest while flying along ever increasing arcs that are centred on the nest. Flying along these arcs, the insects counter-turn in such a way that the nest entrance is always seen in the frontal visual field at slightly lateral positions. Here we asked how the insects may achieve keeping track of the nest entrance location given that it is a small, inconspicuous hole in the ground, surrounded by complex natural structures that undergo unpredictable perspective transformations as the insect pivots around the area and gains distance from it. We reconstructed the natural visual scene experienced by wasps and bees during their learning flights and applied a number of template-based tracking methods to these image sequences. We find that tracking with a fixed template fails very quickly in the course of a learning flight, but that continuously updating the template allowed us to reliably estimate nest direction in reconstructed image sequences. This is true even for later sections of learning flights when the insects are so far away from the nest that they cannot resolve the nest entrance as a visual feature. We discuss why visual goal-anchoring is likely to be important during the acquisition of visual-spatial memories and describe experiments to test whether insects indeed update nest-related templates during their learning flights. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Furthermore, the movement of hives from one orchard to another could spread plant diseases over large distances. We investigated whether honey bees might play a role in the transmission of different pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae. We detected live P. syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), a pathogen of kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.), on caged bees in hives 6 days after the bees were inoculated with Psa, and recorded up to 1.8 × 104 colony forming units of Psa on honey bees foraging naturally on flowers of Psa-infected vines.

PssSmr was found on caged bees in hives 6 d after they were inoculated and PssSmr survived in hives for at least 14 days.

One of the drivers for the decline of wild bees is land-use change, which affects the field mosaic and the fragmentation of the landscape. There is no general consensus in the literature about how wild bees respond to landscape configuration. Up to now, there are no simulation models that compare the performances of different solitary bees at the landscape scale. Body-size-related traits affect individual foraging behavior. We have therefore developed a spatially explicit individual-based simulation model, SOLBEE, with different bee traits and behavioral rules, which mimics the behavior and movement of pollen-collecting solitary bees. The model landscape is a square kilometer in size and consists of many patches with foraging habitat (varying amount) separated by inhospitable matrix (varying fragmentation levels). The foraging habitat has patch attributes such as flower density and minimum patch size. The bees differ in size (and in derived foraging traits such as velocity), nesting preference, and nest location. The system is further characterized by a timeframe of a single foraging day (with time steps of 1 s) in which bees forage and compete with each other for pollen. Bee numbers (and density within the landscape) are scaled with present foraging resources and body size. During the day, these central-place foragers displace pollen from flowers (distributed over a mosaic of patches) to their nest. The main goal is to compare how bees perform in terms of fitness (brood cells) and pollination services (number of flowers visited, foraging habitat visitation, and foraging distance) within a foraging day. Parameterization of the model input is mainly based on literature review, and the model’s rule behavior was improved with a pattern-oriented approach. In several examples, we present four simulation experiments to investigate parameter effects and parameter sensitivity (Section 10.4). We show that the model produces realistic foraging behavior progressively during the foraging day and that the responses overlap well with values from the literature. This can be considered as a validation with the exception that model bees were found to be somewhat more efficient than real bees, yielding higher numbers of brood cells. A global sensitivity analysis of the parameters in their biological range revealed that the amount of pollen per flower (i.e., flower size) most influenced the number of brood cells and foraging habitat visitation. Body size was the dominant parameter for the number of visited flowers and the mean flown distance. The remaining two simulation experiments showed that the model can be considered robust against small changes (10% change in parameter value). The parameters that affected the responses here most were handling time per flower from the bee-related parameters and the amount of pollen per flower and pollen limitation (dispensing mechanism of the flower) from the landscape-related parameters. The simulation experiments yielded basic understanding of the model. Time constraints are more important for solitary bees than foraging resources, as they affect wood-nesting bees, which nest at field edges, more than soil-nesting bees. © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Book Chapter,Scopus

Systemic insecticides are recognized as one of the drivers of worldwide honey and wild bee declines. Particularly honey bees in agricultural environments are exposed to pesticides when they collect crop pollen and nectar. However, landscape scale studies which analyze pollen use and foraging distances of honey bees on mass-flowering crops like maize to evaluate potential exposure risks are currently lacking. In an experimental approach on a landscape scale we took advantage of intra-colonial dance communication to gather information about the location of utilized pollen resources. During maize flowering, four observation hives were placed in and rotated between 11 different landscapes which covered a gradient from low to high maize acreage. A higher frequency of dances for foraging locations on maize fields compared to other land use types shows that maize is an intensively used pollen resource for honey bee colonies. Mean foraging distances were significantly shorter for maize pollen than for other pollen origins. The percentage of maize pollen foragers did not increase with maize acreage in the landscape. The proportion of grassland area providing alternative pollen sources did not reduce the percentage of maize pollen foragers. Our findings allow estimating the distance-related exposure risk of honey bee colonies to pollen from surrounding maize fields treated with systemic insecticides. Similarly, the results can be used to estimate the exposure to transgenic maize pollen, which is relevant for honey production in European countries. Provision of alternative pollen resources within agri-environmental schemes could potentially reduce exposure risk to pesticide contaminated crop pollen. © 2014 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Article,Scopus

Much of this deviation can be explained through differences in the characteristics of the flower patch, but not all. We suggest that the position of the flower patch within the landscape can have strong effects on bee patch use, independent of the characteristics of the flower patch, through changes in access to nesting resources and the microclimate. Further, the effects of different habitat configurations are likely to vary among bee groups, depending on flight distances and resource requirements. We surveyed local habitat and plant community characteristics around 100 observation plots in native grassland within temperate savannah and recorded bee patch use by direct observation. Using structural equation modeling, we quantified the direct and indirect effect of plant community and habitat configuration on patch use for all bees, only bumblebees, and only non-bumblebees. Our models explained nearly 50% of the variation in bee patch use, with equal importance assigned to local habitat configuration and the plant community. Flower abundance was the best indicator of patch use, followed by distance to forest edge, site productivity and proportion forest cover. Contrary to previous findings, flower diversity had weak, yet negative effects on patch use after accounting for covariance with other factors. Although all bees most frequently visited plots with high flower densities, bumblebees preferentially used edge habitats, while non-bumblebees were mostly found in productive grassland areas with access to forest habitat. Our results show that small-scale habitat configuration can have direct effects on bee patch use as strong as or stronger than those of the flower patch itself. Further, the exact habitat configuration that drives bee patch choices is likely to vary among groups.

In this study, Vosnesensky bumble bees (Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski) were collected from a range of human-altered and natural landscapes in northern California. Extensive vegetation surveys and Geographic Information System (GIS)-based habitat classifications were conducted at each site, bees were genotyped to identify colony mates, and pollen loads were examined to identify visited plants. In contrast to predictions based on strong competitive interactions, pollen load composition was significantly more similar for bees captured in a shared study region compared with bees throughout the research area but was not significantly more similar for colony mates. Preference analyses revealed that pollen loads were not composed of the most abundant plant species per study region. The majority of ranked pollen preference lists were significantly correlated for pairwise comparisons of colony mates and individuals within a study region, whereas the majority of pairwise comparisons of ranked pollen preference lists between individuals located at separate study regions were uncorrelated. Results suggest that pollen load composition and foraging preferences are similar for bees throughout a shared landscape regardless of colony membership.

The Main Agroecological Structure (MAS) is a new concept to identify and characterize the agroecosystems. The method uses local variables related with agricultural management, landscape and cultural variables. As a first approach to study the relationship between MAS and pollination, we characterized nine systems (five coffee farms, four forests) located in Cundinamarca, using ten local variables, the distance to the forest as a landscape variable and bees (visitors of coffee flowers). The field work was done during the flowerings of 2011 y 2012. After the capture, bees were identified and the pollen loads were analyzed. We found 130 bees of the subfamilies: Halictinae (three species), Megachilidae (one species) and Apinae (nine species). Trigona was the richest genera. The most common visitors of coffee flowers were Apis mellifera and Paratrigona eutaeniata. The bees richness was positive related with plants richness (P = 0.031, R2 = 0.96) and the forest proximity (P = 0.0075, R2 = 0.52), Also, we found a negatively trend with the increase in coffee density (P = 0.045, R2 = 0.67). In the analysis of the pollen loads we identified trees, herbs and epiphytes species, this suggested that bees foraging in all vegetation strata. In this analysis we also found species related with the coffee system and others more related with forest and hedges. We concluded that a change in MAS affecting bee’s composition and richness, and preserving richness of bees, implies protection of plant diversity inside the coffee farm and also the maintenance of nearby ecosystems. © 2014 Sociedad Colombiana de Entomologia.

This algorithm has been successfully used as an optimization tool in combinatorial and functional optimization fields. In addition, its behavior very closely mimics the actual behavior that occurs in nature, and it is very simple and easy to implement. However, its convergence speed to the optimal solution still needs further improvement and it also needs a mechanism to obviate getting trapped in local optima. In this paper, a novel initialization algorithm based on the patch concept and Levy flight distribution is proposed to initialize the population of bees in BA. Consequently, we incorporate this initialization procedure into a proposed enhanced BA variant. The proposed variant is more natural than conventional variants of BA. It mimics the patch environment in nature and Levy flight, which is believed to characterize the foraging patterns of bees in nature. The results of experiments conducted on several widely used high-dimensional benchmarks indicate that our proposed enhanced BA variant significantly outperforms other BA variants and state-of-the-art variants of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, and success rate. In addition, the results of experimental analyses conducted indicate that our proposed enhanced BA is very stable, has the ability to deal with differences in search ranges, and rapidly converges without getting stuck in local optima. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

Less is known about the viability of this tactic for other cropping systems, or the effects of outfitting hives with dispensers on the bees. Experiments conducted in lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) fields indicated that home-made wooden, Koppert, and Enviroquest dispensers had no significant effects on foraging behavior or pollen loads of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens, but the presence of a dispenser did reduce the rate of workers exiting hives. Following exit of bees from dispensers, no difference was found in the quantity of the microbial agent Clonostachys rosea applied to the bees or blossoms, and distribution of product in the field was not influenced by dispenser design or distance from hives. However, the prevalence of the pathogen Botrytis cinerea in blossoms from cages that contained hives with dispensers with C. rosea was significantly less (10-20 %) than blossom infection in control plots, despite unseasonably inclement conditions and restricted foraging. These results suggest that C. rosea can be effectively delivered by commercial bumble bees for prevention of B. cinerea infection in V. angustifolium, but the efficacy of the technique will be limited during periods of poor weather that often occur in regions where lowbush blueberries are grown.

In this research, we examine the separate and combined effects of wing area and wing area asymmetry on maximum load-lifting capability in bumble bees Bombus impatiens Cresson, 1863. Individual bees with experimentally induced forewing wear (0%-24% forewing area loss, 0%-38% forewing area asymmetry) were harnessed with a string to which small bead groups were attached and tested in a flight chamber to measure the maximum weight that they could lift incrementally. Wing wear significantly decreased load-lifting ability: the higher the mean wing area loss, the less mass a bee could lift (2.66 mg load reduction per 1% forewing area loss, which represents ~1.6% of mean body mass or ~5.2% of expected mean nectar load). However, wing area asymmetry, both alone and in combination with area loss, had no detectable effect on maximum lift. The clear cost of wing wear for bumble bees is a linear reduction in weight-lifting capability through loss of wing area. This relatively strong diminution of load lifting by wing wear, observed over the range of wing area losses naturally accrued by wild bees, provides a potential mechanism for declining foraging ability and survivorship of worker bees with wing wear. What remains to be explained is the utter insensitivity of maximum load lifted to forewing asymmetry.",Article,Scopus

The proposed M2OBA extend original artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to multi-objective and cooperative mode by combining external archive, comprehensive learning, greedy selection, crowding distance, and cooperative search strategy. Our algorithm uses the concept of Pareto dominance and comprehensive learning mechanism to determine the flight direction of a bee and maintains nondominated solution vectors in external archive based on greedy selection and crowing distance strategies. With cooperative search approaches, the single population ABC has been extended to interacting multi-hive model by constructing colony-level interaction topology and information exchange strategies. With six mathematical benchmark functions, M2OBA is proved to have significantly better performance than three successful multi-objective optimizers, namely the fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), the multi-objective particle swarm optimizer (MOPSO), and the multi-objective ABC (MOABC), for solving complex multi-objective optimization problems. M2OBA is then used for solving the real-world OPF problem that considers the cost, loss, and emission impacts as the objective functions. The 30-bus IEEE test system is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results, which are also compared to NSGA-II, MOPSO, and MOABC, are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We here report on the results of sampling campaigns in 2004, and 2010-2012 showing that both species have established and massively expanded their range. Bombus terrestris, in particular, has spread by some 200 km year-1 and had reached the Atlantic coast in Argentina by the end of 2011. Both species, and especially B. terrestris, are infected by protozoan parasites that seem to spread along with the imported hosts and spillover to native species. Genetic analyses by polymorphic microsatellite loci suggest that the host population of B. terrestris is genetically diverse, as expected from a large invading founder population, and structured through isolation by distance. Genetically, the populations of the trypanosomatid parasite, Crithidia bombi, sampled in 2004 are less diverse, and distinct from the ones sampled later. Current C. bombi populations are highly heterozygous and also structured through isolation by distance correlating with the genetic distances of B. terrestris, suggesting the latter's expansion to be a main structuring factor for the parasite. Remarkably, wherever B. terrestris spreads, the native Bombus dahlbomii disappears although the reasons remain unclear. Our ecological and genetic data suggest a major invasion event that is currently unfolding in southern South America with disastrous consequences for the native bumblebee species. © 2013 British Ecological Society.",Article,Scopus

Defensive behavior can be mediated by chemical communication, for example through the use of alarm pheromones. The Stingless bee species Melipona flavolineata Friese is an important species for meliponiculture in Brazil, especially in the Amazon region. In order to improve the current management methods for the species, this study aimed to describe the range of defensive strategies used by the stingless bee M. flavolineata towards inter and intraspecific chemical signals known to trigger defensive responses in related species, namely the head secretions of the robber bee Lestrimelitta limao (Smith) and the mandibular gland extract of conspecifics M. flavolineata workers. The stimuli provoked different defensive reactions. The head secretions of the robber bee repelled returning foragers, elicited the enclosing of the nest entrance tube with batumen balls and the agglomeration of workers outside the box. In contrast, the mandibular gland extract elicited aggression towards the pheromone deposition site, transport of resin and generalised agitated flights. Our results confirm the role of the mandibular gland as a source of alarm pheromone in this species and the chemical triggering of a specific defensive response to the known cleptoparasite L. limao.",Article,Scopus

Insects show a wide range of adaptive behaviors that have allowed them to respond successfully to adverse climatic conditions by temporarily interrupting some of their activities or development. One such behavior is diapause. Diapause can be defined as a gradual and progressive interruption in development or ontogeny of an organism in any phase of its lifecycle in order to survive cyclic unfavorable environmental conditions. This review presents an overview of the current knowledge of diapause in stingless bees and describes the various studies on this subject. It focuses on Plebeia species, the most studied genus in this regard. In this group of bees, provisioning and oviposition behavior ceases in autumn/winter, a so-called reproductive diapause. Besides the cessation of brood-rearing activity, other behaviors, such as foraging, are also modified. The mechanisms that induce the reproductive diapause are still unclear, but evidence points to temperature and photoperiodism as the main drivers of this behavior.",Article,Scopus

Regarding oilseed rape, the most common biofuel crop in the EU, positive responses of flower-visiting insects to plentiful nectar and pollen seem apparent. However, previous investigations on this insect guild revealed conflicting results, potentially because they focused on different taxonomic groups representing a narrow range of ecological traits and considered only short time periods. Here, using trap nests in landscapes with independent gradients in area of oilseed rape and seminatural habitats, we assessed the whole community of cavity-nesting bees and wasps, including early- and late-emerging species. Our study's temporal resolution allowed determination of flowering and postflowering effects of oilseed rape on these species' richness, abundance, and mortality. Species richness of cavity-nesting bees and wasps significantly increased with oilseed rape, although nesting activity was considerably higher after mass flowering. In addition to increasing richness independently of oilseed rape, the amount of seminatural habitat in the landscape was the sole positive driver of insect abundance once the community's dominant species was accounted for as a covariate. Thus, growth of the co-occurring species' community is not stimulated by the resource pulse provided by oilseed rape early in the year, but by persistent resources provided by seminatural habitats after mass flowering. Early individuals of bivoltine species' first generations accumulated in seminatural habitats when these habitats were scarce, but became increasingly diluted when habitat availability increased. Once established, later foraging females generally benefited from the resource availability of seminatural habitats when initializing the second generation. We conclude that mass-flowering crops, despite covering only a short interval of the community's main activity phase, benefit bee and wasp species richness. However, seminatural habitats are crucial in maintaining viable communities of flower-visiting insects at the landscape scale, mitigating potential negative effects of high land-use intensities in modern agro-ecosystems. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Article,Scopus

We examined the distribution of orchard species (apples, pears, plums and other top fruits) and their pollinators in Great Britain, for present and future climatic conditions projected for 2050 under the SRES A1B Emissions Scenario. We used a relative index of pollinator availability as a proxy for pollination service. At present, there is a large spatial overlap between orchards and their pollinators, but predictions for 2050 revealed that the most suitable areas for orchards corresponded to low pollinator availability.

Since 2006, when unexpectedly high colony losses were first reported, articles have proliferated in the popular press suggesting a range of possible causes and raising alarm over the general decline of bees. Suggested causes include pesticides, genetically modified crops, habitat fragmentation, and introduced diseases and parasites. Scientists have concluded that multiple factors in various combinations-including mites, fungi, viruses, and pesticides, as well as other factors such as reduction in forage, poor nutrition, and queen failure-are the most probable cause of elevated colony loss rates. Investigators and regulators continue to focus on the possible role that insecticides, particularly the neonicotinoids, may play in honeybee health. Neonicotinoid insecticides are insect neurotoxicants with desirable features such as broad-spectrum activity, low application rates, low mammalian toxicity, upward systemic movement in plants, and versatile application methods. Their distribution throughout the plant, including pollen, nectar, and guttation fluids, poses particular concern for exposure to pollinators. The authors describe how neonicotinoids interact with the nervous system of honeybees and affect individual honeybees in laboratory situations. Because honeybees are social insects, colony effects in semifield and field studies are discussed. The authors conclude with a review of current and proposed guidance in the United States and Europe for assessing the risks of pesticides to honeybees.

In the first stage, honeybee colonies were exposed to a commercial formulation of glyphosate applied to flowering Phacelia tanacetifolia with glyphosate residues quantified in relevant matrices (pollen and nectar) collected by foraging bees on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 postapplication and glyphosate levels in larvae were measured on days 4 and 7. Glyphosate levels in pollen were approximately 10 times higher than in nectar and glyphosate demonstrated rapid decline in both matrices. Residue data along with foraging rates and food requirements of the colony were then used to set dose rates in the effects study. In the second stage, the toxicity of technical glyphosate to developing honeybee larvae and pupae, and residues in larvae, were then determined by feeding treated sucrose directly to honeybee colonies at dose rates that reflect worst-case exposure scenarios. There were no significant effects from glyphosate observed in brood survival, development, and mean pupal weight. Additionally, there were no biologically significant levels of adult mortality observed in any glyphosate treatment group. Significant effects were observed only in the fenoxycarb toxic reference group and included increased brood mortality and a decline in the numbers of bees and brood. Mean glyphosate residues in larvae were comparable at 4 days after spray application in the exposure study and also following dosing at a level calculated from the mean measured levels in pollen and nectar, showing the applicability and robustness of the approach for dose setting with honeybee brood studies. This study has developed a versatile and predictive approach for use in higher tier honeybee toxicity studies. It can be used to realistically quantify exposure of colonies to pesticides to allow the appropriate dose rates to be determined, based on realistic worst-case residues in pollen and nectar and estimated intake by the colony, as shown by the residue analysis. Previous studies have used the standard methodology developed primarily to identify pesticides with insect-growth disrupting properties of pesticide formulations, which are less reliant on identifying realistic exposure scenarios. However, this adaptation of the method can be used to determine dose-response effects of colony level exposure to pesticides with a wide range of properties. This approach would limit the number of replicated tunnel or field-scale studies that need to be undertaken to assess effects on honeybee brood and may be of particular benefit where residues in pollen and nectar are crop- and/or formulation-specific, such as systemic seed treatments and granular applications. © 2014 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

Very few studies have investigated the effects of nectar robbing on the behaviour of legitimate pollinators so far. Such behavioural changes may lead to the reduction of geitonogamy or to increased pollen movement. We simulated nectar robbing in experimental sites as well as in natural populations of Aconitum napellus ssp. lusitanicum, a rare plant pollinated by long-tongued bumblebees. In an experimental setup, we removed the nectaries of 40 % of the flowers, which is similar to rates of robbing observed in wild populations. Patches of plants with experimentally robbed flowers were compared with control patches containing plants with untreated flowers. We observed pollinator behaviour, mimicked male reproductive success (pollen dispersal) using fluorescent dye, and measured female reproductive success (seed set). The main legitimate visitors were bumblebees while honeybees were often observed robbing nectar. They did so by ""base working"", i.e. sliding between tepals. Bumblebees tended to visit fewer flowers per plant and spent less time per single flower when these had been experimentally robbed. This change in behaviour consequently increased the proportion of flowers visited by bumblebees in patches with robbed flowers. Fluorescent dye mimicking pollen flow was dispersed larger distances after pollinators had visited patches with robbed flowers compared to control patches. Average seed set per plant was not affected by nectar robbing. Our results demonstrated that A. napellus does not suffer from nectar robbery but may rather benefit via improved pollen dispersal and thus, male reproductive success. Knowledge on such combined effects of behavioural changes of pollinators due to nectar robbery is important to understand the evolutionary significance of exploiters of such mutualistic relationships between plants and their pollinators. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Article,Scopus

This study tested the hypothesis that bumblebees foraging in English urban gardens preferentially visited sympatric Palaearctic-range plants over species originating outside their native range.MethodsTwenty-seven surveys of flower availability and bumblebee visitation (Bombus spp.) were conducted over a 3-month summer period. Plants were categorized according to whether they were native British, Palaearctic or non-Palaearctic in origin. A phylogeny of the 119 plant species recorded was constructed and the relationship between floral abundance and the frequency of pollinator visits investigated by means of phylogenetically independent contrasts. Differentiation in utilization of plant species by the five bumblebee species encountered was investigated using niche overlap analyses.Key ResultsThere was conflicting evidence for preferential use of native-range Palaearctic plant species by bumblebees depending on which plants were included in the analysis. Evidence was also found for niche partitioning between species based on respective preferences for native and non-native biogeographical range plants. Two bumblebees (Bombus terrestris and B. pratorum) concentrated their foraging activity on non-Palaearctic plants, while two others (B. hortorum and B. pascourum) preferred Palaearctic species.ConclusionsThe long-running debate about the value of native and non-native garden plants to pollinators probably stems from a failure to properly consider biogeographical overlap between plant and pollinator ranges. Gardeners can encourage pollinators without consideration of plant origin or bias towards 'local' biogeographical species. However, dietary specialist bumblebees seem to prefer plants sympatric with their own biogeographical range and, in addition to the cultivation of these species in gardens, provision of native non-horticultural ('weed') species may also be important for pollinator conservation. © 2014 The Author.",Article,Scopus

It comprises a multitude of behavioural tasks accomplished by various groups of animals in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. The fact that this richness of behaviours mediated by naturally occurring polarized light has come to the fore only rather recently is certainly due to our own inability to perceive these polarized light phenomena without the aid of special optical devices. While in the present book the chapters are arranged according to animal taxa, so that questions are posed and arguments are presented within the branching pattern of the phylogenetic tree, this introductory chapter retraces the time arrow of discovery. For example, immediately after Karl von Frisch had demonstrated that bees can perceive the polarization of skylight, the 1950s were dominated by the search for the polarization analyser in arthropod eyes. The 1970s and early 1980s became high noon for the behavioural experimental analysis of the bee’s and ant’s skylight compass, followed in the 1990s by the advent of forceful neurobiological investigations of the polarization vision network residing in the insect (especially locust) brain. At about the same time polarized reflections from water surfaces were recognized as cues used by flying aquatic insects on dispersal. In the late 1980s vertebrates, mainly fish and birds, appeared on the polarization vision scene as well. Since the turn of the millennium long-standing studies of various aspects of underwater polarization vision have received an enormous boost, especially by including small-field, close-range polarization signalling, and now advance at an ever increasing pace. Most recently, with new technologies at hand, the interest in the basic mechanisms of polarization sensitivity comes full circle when now a closer and more sophisticated look can be taken at the molecular mechanisms of how dichroism is generated within the photoreceptor membrane. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.",Book Chapter,Scopus

It is becoming increasingly popular, in places such as North America and some European countries, to engage members of the general public and school pupils in the collection of scientific data to support long-term environmental monitoring. Participants in such schemes are generally volunteers and are referred to as citizen scientists. The Christmas bird count in the US is one of the worlds longest running citizen science projects whereby volunteers have been collecting data on birds on a specific day since 1900. Similar volunteer networks in Ireland have been in existence since the 1960s and were established to monitor the number and diversity of birds throughout the country. More recently, initiatives such as Greenwave (2006) and Nature Watch (2009) invite school children and members of the general public respectively, to record phenology data from a range of common species of plant, insect and bird. In addition, the Irish butterfly and bumblebee monitoring schemes engage volunteers to record data on sightings of these species. The primary purpose of all of these networks is to collect data by which to monitor changes in wildlife development and diversity, and in the case of Greenwave to involve children in hands-on, inquiry-based science. Together these various networks help raise awareness of key environmental issues, such as climate change and loss of biodiversity, while at the same time promote development of scientific skills among the general population. In addition, they provide valuable scientific data by which to track environmental change. Here we examine the role of citizen science in monitoring biodiversity in Ireland and conclude that some of the data collected in these networks can be used to fulfil Ireland's statutory obligations for nature conservation. In addition, a bee thought previously to be extinct has been rediscovered and a range expansion of a different bee has been confirmed. However, it also became apparent that some of the networks play more of an educational than a scientific role. Furthermore, we draw on experience from a range of citizen science projects to make recommendations on how best to establish new citizen science projects in Ireland and strengthen existing ones. © 2013 ISB.",Article,Scopus

Whilst there is appreciable variation in the cognitive performance of animals, we know surprisingly little about the extent to which learning varies among individuals across different sensory modalities. Do individuals that are good at learning in one sensory modality also perform well in another (performance is correlated between modalities), or do individuals demonstrate specialisation in learning performance in one modality (trading-off performance between modalities)? We tested these hypotheses by examining the performance of 76 Bombus terrestris workers, from four colonies, in both an odour-and visual learning task. Olfactory learning was assessed using proboscis extension reflex (PER) conditioning and visual (colour) learning was examined using a well-established free-flying paradigm. Our results showed neither a correlation, nor a trade-off, in individual performance for learning tasks using different sensory modalities. However, there was considerable variation among workers within each colony in their performance in both learning tasks. This extent of interindividual variation in learning ability across sensory modalities could be adaptive for colonies dealing with changeable foraging conditions. There was also significant intercolony variation in final task performance level in the olfactory learning task, and both the strength and persistence of blue preference in the colour learning task. This is the first study to demonstrate variation in olfactory learning performance across multiple bumblebee colonies using PER conditioning, suggesting this is an effective paradigm for assessing associative olfactory learning performance both within and among colonies. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus

We also used a historical dataset to compare historical and recent habitat suitability predictions for forecasting variations in species' responses to regional climate warming. Location: The Cantabrian Range (Iberian Peninsula, south-western Europe). Methods: During 2007-09 we sampled bumblebees in 37 localities and developed generalized linear models (GLMs) to predict species' occurrence and abundance in relation to environmental variables. We extracted independent variables at different spatial scales for each locality, based on topoclimatic (slope, temperature and rainfall patterns) and land-cover (habitat configuration and composition) variables. We also used historical (1988-89) bumblebee data (23 localities) to both calibrate recent distribution models and determine the current environmental factors underlying the realized response of individual species to regional climate warming (0.8 °C) over two decades. Results: Occurrence and abundance patterns of species were best predicted by models combining topoclimatic and land-cover variables. Our findings revealed three groups of species, distinguished on the basis of the realized response of individual species to regional climate warming: one comprising six species with climate-based tracking behaviour, a second with three species tracking suitable landscape composition and configuration regardless of climatic conditions, and a third comprising one species showing no apparent tracking behaviour. Main conclusions: Topoclimate and land cover determined the occurrence and abundance patterns of bumblebee species in mountainous landscapes, even at fine spatial extents. Both environmental variables, however, differentially influenced bumblebees, thereby providing relevant clues for determining the current environmental factors underlying species' distributions and their susceptibility to changing environmental conditions. Our findings therefore suggest that determining habitat suitability can be used as a baseline approach for understanding species-specific responses to climate warming and for developing vulnerability assessments for conservation-focused management planning. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Flowers uniform in colour to humans, however, can appear patterned to insects due to spatial variation in UV reflectance on petals. A UV 'bullseye' pattern that is common among angiosperms - UV-absorbing petal bases and UV-reflective apices - purportedly functions as a nectar guide, enhancing pollinator orientation and experimental evidence suggests that UV reflectance increases floral apparency to pollinators. We test the pollinator-attracting and pollinator-orienting functions of floral UV pattern and UV reflectance under natural conditions. Specifically, we address whether UV reflection alone, or UV pattern influences small bee and syrphid fly attraction rates (approaching, landing and foraging visits), foraging rates, and likelihood of foraging and orienting to the centre of flowers, using Argentina anserina, a species whose flowers exhibit variability in the size of the UV bullseye. We manipulated UV properties while maintaining uniformly yellow petals to create three phenotypes - uniformly UV-absorptive, uniformly UV-reflective, and inversed bullseye (reflective bases and absorptive apices) and compared insect visitation and behaviour to control flowers with the common UV bullseye phenotype. The presence of UV pattern increased attraction rates by both bees and syrphid flies relative to either fully UV reflective or absorptive flowers. However, only in the inverse array did the bullseye phenotype elicit higher foraging rates than the test flower. Neither the presence of pattern, nor the reversal of the common pattern influenced the likelihood of pollinator foraging or orientating to the flowers' centre during a visit. We provide some of the first evidence to suggest that flowers with spatial variation in UV reflectance may be more conspicuous to insects than those with petals that uniformly absorb or reflect UV, all of which are naturally occurring phenotypes. Further, we verify that the most common UV pattern in nature increases insect attraction and foraging rate relative to the inverse pattern. Results confirm a distance apparency function of the UV bullseye, but we argue for reconsideration of the notion that pollinators benefit from this ubiquitous floral motif through enhanced foraging efficiency. © 2013 British Ecological Society.",Article,Scopus

Crantz that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. Epipactis palustris is native to Britain, being widely distributed throughout England and Wales, but is less common in the north. Although absent from most of Scotland, it occurs as far north as Perthshire. It is widely distributed in Ireland. The species extends throughout most of Europe, occurring as far east as Mongolia and the north of Turkey, but it is absent from the southern Mediterranean region. Epipactis palustris grows mainly in full sunlight, rarely under shade, and on calcareous, but nutrient-poor, moist to wet substrates. It favours flushed or seasonally inundated areas in which the intensity of competition from other vegetation is low. It is most commonly found in wet dune slacks, calcareous fens and on peat, but it also occurs on sandy substrates overlying heavy clay or loamy soils. Occasionally, it can also be found near the top of slopes in chalk downland. Epipactis palustris multiplies both by vegetative propagation and sexual reproduction. Vegetative propagation involves the production of regularly branched rhizomes. It flowers in Britain from the end of June until the beginning of September. The flowers produce nectar, which is often colonized by bacteria and to a lesser extent by yeasts. The species is pollinated by a wide range of insects, including honeybees, flies, wasps, beetles, bumblebees and ants, but is also capable of limited spontaneous autogamy. The most efficient pollinators are small bees and solitary wasps. Fruit production is generally high (>80% of the flowers produce capsules). Epipactis palustris is vulnerable to changes in soil water level and to substrate nutrient enrichment. It has suffered a strong decline in its distribution range in Britain, with most losses of local populations occurring before 1930. Habitat destruction and drainage of marshes and fens appear to be the most common causes for the decline of the species. Restoration of old wet dune slacks by topsoil removal and addition of hay from neighbouring vegetation has been successful in encouraging colonization and establishment of populations of the species within a few years. Cessation of draining of mires may also promote the long-term survival of populations of the species. © 2014 British Ecological Society.",Article,Scopus

Pollinator nutrition is dependent on floral resources (i.e., nectar and pollen), which are linked to landscape composition. Here, we present a stratified analysis of the nutritional composition of beebread in managed honeybee hives with a view to examining potential sources of variation in its nutritional composition. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that beebread composition correlates with local land use and therefore available floral resources. The results demonstrated that the starch, lipid, and moisture contents of beebread are all highly conserved across hives, whereas levels of protein and nonreducing sugar increased as the year progressed, reducing sugars, however, decreased during the first half of the year and then increased toward the end. Local land use around hives was quantified using data from the Countryside Survey 2007 Land Cover Map. Bee-bread protein content was negatively correlated with increasing levels of arable and horticultural farmland surrounding hives and positively correlated with the cover of natural grasslands and broadleaf woodlands. Reducing sugar content was also positively correlated with the amount of broad-leaved woodland in a 3 Km2 radius from the hives. Previous studies on a range of invertebrates, including honeybees, indicate that dietary protein intake may have a major impact on correlates of fitness, including longevity and immune function. The finding that beebread protein content correlates with land use suggests that landscape composition may impact on insect pollinator well-being and provides a link between landscape and the nutritional ecology of socially foraging insects in a way not previously considered. © 2014 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

Several transgenic varieties of rice have been developed, and some have recently entered pre-production trials. One concern with genetically modified (GM) crops is transgene escape, but prior studies suggest this risk is low for rice because it is self-pollinated and the dispersal of pollen by wind is limited. Little is known about the impact of pollen transport by insects. We characterized the insects visiting rice plants during anthesis and considered the effects of insect pollination on gene flow. We conducted a 2-year nationwide survey in China and identified more than 510 insect species that visited rice flowers. Honeybees, hoverflies and several other species carried large amounts of pollen. The European honeybee Apis mellifera visited rice flowers regularly with daily foraging activity peaking between 12.00 and 13.00 h. We monitored 20 European honeybee colonies located 100-1000 metres away from rice fields in mixed agricultural landscapes and found the honeybees carried viable pollen at least 500 m away from the rice pollen source. We used four GM rice lines as pollen donors, their non-GM parental varieties as pollen recipients and the European honeybee as the pollinator in field-cage experiments to assess whether honeybees increase the frequency of gene flow in rice. Results from screening over 1·5 million germinated offspring seeds over a 3-year study period showed that honeybees significantly increase transgene flow in rice. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that a remarkably high diversity of insects visit rice flowers in China and that hundreds of species including honeybees carry large amounts of rice pollen. European honeybees carry viable pollen over long distances, forage on rice flowers regularly and increase the frequency of transgene flow. Insects mediate gene flow in rice more than previously assumed, and this should be taken into consideration during the ecological risk assessment of transgene flow in self-pollinated and/or anemophilous crops.

The introduction of invasive species to the United States-whether deliberate or unintentional-from around the globe can pose a significant threat to native animal and plant communities, and may result in extinctions of native animals and plants, species disruptions as native and nonnative species compete for limited resources, reduced biodiversity, and altered terrestrial or aquatic habitats. This can result in a range of economic, ecologic, and cultural losses, including reduced agricultural output from U.S. farms and ranches; degradation of U.S. waterways, coastal areas, national parks, and forests; and altered urban, suburban, and rural landscapes. It is estimated that 50,000 non-native species have been introduced to the United States. The potential economic costs associated with nonindigenous plant and animal species are estimated at $129 billion annually in the United States. A few examples of the types of damages attributed to non-native invasive species in the United States are as follows. Burmese pythons are multiplying in south Florida, becoming a top carnivore and killing large numbers of native species of reptiles, birds, and mammals. Zebra and quagga mussels from Eastern Europe are clogging intakes for urban water supplies and nuclear power plants in the Great Lakes and the Mississippi basin. The light brown apple moth, a native pest of Australia, has been detected in California and is causing damage to a wide range of plant species and commercial fruit and vegetable crops. Leafy spurge is lowering the forage value of western grazing land, and reducing overall land values. In the United States, numerous federal and interagency efforts share responsibilities regarding invasive species. Among the federal agencies involved are the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, Interior, Transportation, and others, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Executive Office of the President. Of these, three Departments-Agriculture, Commerce, and Interior-play a major role by cochairing the National Invasive Species Council (NISC). Created by Executive Order 13112 in 1999, NISC provides high-level interdepartmental coordination of federal invasive species actions and works with other federal and nonfederal groups to address invasive species issues at the national level. In FY2012, the U.S. government spent an estimated $2.2 billion across a range of federal agencies and activities in an effort to prevent, control, and eradicate invasive species domestically. Activities at the Department of Agriculture accounted for the bulk of available federal funding, nearly $1.3 billion (58% of total available funds). Activities at the Department of Homeland Security, comprised of mostly border protection and security activities, accounted for about $0.7 billion (31% of total funding). The remainder of federal funding, about $0.2 billion (about 11% of total funding) covers activities across a range of agencies at the Departments of Interior, Commerce, and Defense, and also other independent agencies. Despite efforts to achieve high-level interdepartmental coordination, comprehensive legislation on the treatment of invasive species has never been enacted, and no single law provides coordination among federal agencies. Instead, the current legal framework is largely governed by a patchwork of laws, regulations, policies, and programs. Some laws are tailored to individual species or narrowly focused on what is affected by the species. Other laws have a broader intended purpose and may only peripherally address invasive species. Some laws, although they do not directly address invasive species control or prevention, may limit such introductions. An ""invasive"" species (alternatively known as an alien, exotic, injurious, introduced or naturalized, non-native, nonindigenous, nuisance, or noxious species) refers to an animal or plant that is introduced into an environment where it is not native.1 The introduction of invasive species to the United States-whether deliberate or unintentional-from around the globe can pose a significant threat to native animal and plant communities, and may result in extinctions of native animals and plants, species disruptions as native species compete for limited resources, reduced biodiversity, and altered terrestrial or aquatic habitats. It is estimated that 50,000 non-native species have been introduced to the United States, including nonindigenous plant and animal species (Table 1).2 Examples of some invasive species found in the United States, and the types of damages they may inflict, include the following: . Burmese pythons (Python bivitattus) have multiplied in south Florida, becoming a top carnivore and killing large numbers of native species of reptiles, birds, and mammals. . Brown tree snakes (Boiga irregularis) from the western Pacific continue to threaten power utilities and communications on Guam and the Northern Marianas, and threaten to invade Hawaii and harm its tourism industry. . Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) from Eastern Europe have clogged intakes for urban water supplies and nuclear power plants in the Great Lakes and the Mississippi basin. . Light brown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana), a native pest of Australia, has been detected in California and is causing damage to a wide range of plant species and commercial fruit and vegetable crops. . Lionfish (Pterois volitans), likely released from private aquaria in Florida, have spread north along the U.S. coast and also within the Caribbean. . Formosan termites (Coptotermes formosanus) have devastated living trees and historic buildings in the French Quarter of New Orleans. . Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) has reduced the forage value of western grazing land, resulting in lower overall value to private landowners. All 50 states and the U.S. territories have at least some invasive plants and animals. A few (e.g., Hawaii, Florida, Louisiana, the Great Lakes states, and California) have so many harmful non- natives as to cause major ecological and economic damage to a variety of locations and industries. This report provides an overview of the federal laws and directives in the United States that govern invasive species, and the role of selected federal agencies. A summary of selected laws and agencies is provided in Appendix A. The patchwork of laws that currently govern invasive species in the United States also contribute to fundamentally different approaches to regulate invasive species, which is beyond the scope of this report. In addition to the federal laws discussed in this report, invasive species are regulated and/or managed through a variety of statutes administered by the states, often with the cooperation of federal agencies. This report also does not address the extensive efforts of individual states to deal with invasive species concerns.3 Further, this report focuses primarily on invasive plant and animal species that may affect U.S. agriculture, waterways and coastal areas, national parks and forests, and various ecosystems and landscape environments. The potential for non-native species to adversely affect human health and disease is not addressed in this report. This report also does not address species introductions to the United States that are widely considered beneficial, such as certain crop plants (e.g., wheat, soybeans) and orchard fruit (e.g., apples, pears), as well as honey bees (Apis mellifera) and pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), among other introduced species. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

One method for exploring why landscape change should affect pollinator populations is to combine individual-level behavioural ecological techniques with larger-scale landscape ecology. A modelling framework is described that uses spatially-explicit individual-based models to explore the effects of individual behavioural rules within a landscape. The technique described gives a simple method for exploring the effects of the removal of wild corridors, and the creation of wild set-aside fields: interventions that are common to many national agricultural policies. The effects of these manipulations on central-place nesting pollinators are varied, and depend upon the behavioural rules that the pollinators are using to move through the environment. The value of this modelling framework is discussed, and future directions for exploration are identified. ©2014 Rands.",Article,Scopus

This is typically because distributions of straight line distances between consecutive significant turns in movement paths have heavy power law tails. This diagnostic tool has been called into question because there is currently no standard, unambiguous way to identify significant turns. Even if such a way could be found, statistical analyses based on significant turns cannot account for actual movements made between turns and as a consequence cannot distinguish between true Lévy walks and other fractal random walks such as Lévy modulated correlated random walks where organisms randomly meander rather than move in straight lines between consecutive reorientation events. Here, I show that structure functions (i.e. moments of net displacements made across fixed time intervals) can distinguish between different kinds of Lévy walks and between Lévy walks and random walks with a few scales such as composite correlated random walks and correlated random walks. Distinguishing between these processes will lead to a better understanding of how and why animals perform Lévy walks and help bridge the apparent divide between correlated random walks and Lévy walks. Structure functions do not require turn identification and instead take account of entire movement paths. Using this diagnostic tool, I bolster previous claims that honeybees use a movement strategy that can be approximated by Lévy walks when searching for their hive. I also show how structure functions can be used to establish the extent of self-similar behaviour in meandering Lévy walks. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus

We predicted that, for the mangrove Avicennia marina in temperate southeast Australia, pollinator diversity would be low and its pollination system modified by the exotic honeybee Apis mellifera. Multiyear surveys and experiments were used to test these hypotheses by determining the identity and frequency of flower visitors, quantifying pollinator foraging behaviour, determining the species composition of pollen loads, and demonstrating pollen removal and deposition. We identified 38 species that visited flowers, but only A. mellifera was a significant pollinator. It was the only species to carry large amounts of pollen and forage in a manner permitting transfer of pollen to stigmas. Moreover, A. mellifera was the numerically dominant flower visitor and was effective in both pollen removal and deposition. This study demonstrates the importance of distinguishing flower visitors from pollinators and emphasises the surprisingly widespread influence of the exotic A. mellifera. Finally, our study and a worldwide review of the literature on the pollination of mangroves reveal that the pollination biology of other mangrove systems requires similar scrutiny. © Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation 2013.",Article,Scopus

These factors have been at the core of proposed explanations for the reproductive failure and numerical decline of Acacia carneorum and other threatened acacias. Paradoxically, the sympatric Acacia ligulata is thriving and highly fecund. Although these species have superficially similar floral displays, differences in sexual reproductive success may reflect interactions between flower and inflorescence ontogeny and pollinator assemblages. We compared the floral biology and flower visitor assemblages of A. carneorum and A. ligulata at four sites per species. Both species displayed similar floral ontogeny and synchronicity of display, with inflorescences simultaneously hermaphroditic for 4-5 days. However, A. ligulata displayed a higher density of flowers than A. carneorum and, while both species received a range of flower visitors, A. ligulata was visited by relatively few species and was serviced primarily by the non-native honeybee Apis mellifera, which typically made many within-plant movements during foraging bouts. In contrast, A. carneorum was visited by a diverse suite of native insects that carried little pollen and made fewer within plant movements. On average, Apis mellifera carried 98.4 % A. ligulata pollen, whereas the native insect visitors of A. carneorum carried only 45 % A. carneorum pollen. Differing floral ontogeny or lack of native pollinators does not explain the reproductive failure of A. carneorum. The success of A. ligulata may reflect pollination services provided by A. mellifera and interactions with plant mating systems. © 2013 The Ecological Society of Japan.",Article,Scopus

Here we report that ants can deal with one of the greatest challenges for any navigator: uncontrolled passive displacements. Foraging ants were blown by a jet of air over 3 meters into a dark pit. When subsequently released at windless unfamiliar locations, ants headed in the compass direction opposite to the one they had been blown away, thus functionally increasing their chance of returning to familiar areas. Ants do not appear to collect directional information during the actual passive displacement, but beforehand, while clutching the ground to resist the wind. During that time window, ants compute and store the compass direction of the wind.

Dances are composed of repeated waggle runs, which encode the distance and direction vector from the hive or swarm to the resource. Distance is encoded in the duration of the waggle run, and direction is encoded in the angle of the dancer's body relative to vertical. Glass-walled observation hives enable researchers to observe or video, and decode waggle runs. However, variation in these signals makes it impossible to determine exact locations advertised. We present a Bayesian duration to distance calibration curve using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations that allows us to quantify how accurately distance to a food resource can be predicted from waggle run durations within a single dance. An angular calibration shows that angular precision does not change over distance, resulting in spatial scatter proportional to distance. We demonstrate how to combine distance and direction to produce a spatial probability distribution of the resource location advertised by the dance.

Specifically, little is known about the collection of pollen, an essential component of larval and adult bee food, and whether pollen collection patterns change across habitats, spatial scales, and/or native and non-native floral resource distributions. In this study, the pollen collection patterns and preferences of the yellow-faced bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, were examined across a gradient of natural and human-altered sites. Three hypotheses were investigated: (i) landscape-scale (2km) but not local-scale (250m) floral and habitat composition factors are most predictive of bee-collected pollen composition; (ii) collection of native pollen is greater in sites with greater proportions of natural habitat at landscape scales; and (iii) bees exhibit greater 'preference' for native versus non-native pollen. Bombus vosnesenskii collected more species of pollen when landscape-scale riparian forest cover was low but local- and landscape-scale floral species richness was high. Also, B.vosnesenskii collected pollen from a wide range of plant families and did not exhibit a significant preference for native versus non-native species. Finally, preference analysis indicated that the only significant preference exhibited by B.vosnesenskii during the study period was for Heteromeles arbutifolia, a native shrub.

In the Asian endemic Hiptage benghalensis (Malpighiaceae), mirror-image flowers were found with longitudinally dehiscing anthers and such floral syndromes are firstly reported in the family. We investigated the floral biology and frequencies of left- and right-styled flowers of H.benghalensis in Hainan Island, southern China. We conducted pollination manipulations to determine breeding systems and studied the pollination mechanism. We also examined the compositions of the secretions of the calyx gland. Controlled pollinations revealed that H.benghalensis is self-compatible. Left- and right-styled flowers are produced in the same inflorescence and a 1:1 ratio is found at both plant and population levels. Flowers have extremely reflexed petals, zygomorphic corollas and a single but oversized calyx gland. This gland secretes sugars and mainly attracts ants and wasps in both blooming and fruiting periods. Heteranthery is obvious with one large stamen producing more viable pollen than the nine small stamens. All anthers dehisce longitudinally and pollen grains readily adhere to floral visitors without the need of buzz pollination. The unusual association of mirror-image flowers with longitudinal anthers probably reflects an adaptation to local pollen-collecting (but non-buzzing) honeybees such as Apis dorsata. These results indicate that floral syndromes and pollination adaptation in H.benghalensis differ completely from the New World Malpighiaceae and may help to explain evolutionary adaptations of the family during its long-distance dispersals from the New World to Asia. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.",Article,Scopus

Social bees provide a good model for this and, whilst there are published descriptions of their behaviour on initial learning flights close to the colony, it is still unclear how bees find floral resources over hundreds of metres and how these flights become directed foraging trips. We investigated the spatial ecology of exploration by radar tracking bumblebees, and comparing the flight trajectories of bees with differing experience. The bees left the colony within a day or two of eclosion and flew in complex loops of ever-increasing size around the colony, exhibiting Lévy-flight characteristics constituting an optimal searching strategy. This mathematical pattern can be used to predict how animals exploring individually might exploit a patchy landscape. The bees' groundspeed, maximum displacement from the nest and total distance travelled on a trip increased significantly with experience. More experienced bees flew direct paths, predominantly flying upwind on their outward trips although forage was available in all directions. The flights differed from those of naïve honeybees: they occurred at an earlier age, showed more complex looping, and resulted in earlier returns of pollen to the colony. In summary bumblebees learn to find home and food rapidly, though phases of orientation, learning and searching were not easily separable, suggesting some multi-tasking. © 2013 Osborne et al.",Article,Scopus

Prior work has shown that a set of such rules can explain the formation of the allocation pattern starting from an empty comb. We show that these rules cannot maintain the pattern once the brood start to vacate their cells, and we propose new, biologically realistic rules that better sustain the observed allocation pattern.

We develop new metrics for pattern assessment and employ them in analyzing pattern retention over each simulation run. Applied to our simulation results, these metrics show alteration of an accepted model for honey/pollen consumption based on local information can stabilize the cell allocation pattern over time.

Measuring the derivative allows us to deduce the perceived reward function. The derivative function of the perceived reward equation gives the rate of change of the reward perceived for each reward value. This approach depends on presenting free-flying foragers with a series of two different rewards presented simultaneously (i.e., two-choice, binomial tests).

However, relatively little is known about the effects of oil palm expansion on biodiversity, especially in key ecosystem-service providing organisms like pollinators. Rapid land use change is exacerbated by limited knowledge of the mechanisms causing biodiversity decline in the tropics, particularly those involving landscape features. We examined these mechanisms by undertaking a survey of orchid bees, a well-known group of Neotropical pollinators, across forest and oil palm plantations in Costa Rica. We used chemical baits to survey the community in four regions: continuous forest sites, oil palm sites immediately adjacent to forest, oil palm sites 2km from forest, and oil palm sites greater than 5km from forest. We found that although orchid bees are present in all environments, orchid bee communities diverged across the gradient, and community richness, abundance, and similarity to forest declined as distance from forest increased. In addition, mean phylogenetic distance of the orchid bee community declined and was more clustered in oil palm. Community traits also differed with individuals in oil palm having shorter average tongue length and larger average geographic range size than those in the forest. Our results indicate two key features about Neotropical landscapes that contain oil palm: 1) oil palm is selectively permeable to orchid bees and 2) orchid bee communities in oil palm have distinct phylogenetic and trait structure compared to communities in forest. These results suggest that conservation and management efforts in oil palm-cultivating regions should focus on landscape features. © 2013 Livingston et al.",Article,Scopus

These redirections were largely restricted to rather small deviations from the trained route (<60°, <200 m) and occurred only if the animal did not receive the trained odorant stimulus at the trained feeding site.

MicroRNAs, which play important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation, likewise affect many biological processes. The actions of microRNAs and Vg are known to intersect in the context of reproduction; however, the role of these associations on social behavior is unknown. The phenotypic effects of Vg knockdown are best established and studied in the forager stage of workers. Thus, we exploited the well-established RNA interference (RNAi) protocol for Vg knockdown to investigate its downstream effects on microRNA population in honey bee foragers' brain and fat body tissue. To identify microRNAs that are differentially expressed between tissues in control and knockdown foragers, we used μParaflo microfluidic oligonucleotide microRNA microarrays. Our results showed that 76 and 74 microRNAs were expressed in the brain of control and knockdown foragers whereas 66 and 69 microRNAs were expressed in the fat body of control and knockdown foragers, respectively. Target prediction identified potential seed matches for a differentially expressed subset of microRNAs affected by Vg knockdown. These candidate genes are involved in a broad range of biological processes including insulin signaling, juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroid signaling previously shown to affect foraging behavior. Thus, here we demonstrate a causal link between the Vg knockdown forager phenotype and variation in the abundance of microRNAs in different tissues, with possible consequences for the regulation of foraging behavior. © 2013 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.",Article,Scopus

What is the relationship between flowering phenology and pollen occurring in honey sediments? Location: Mediterranean sylvo-pastoral system in Gallura, Sardinia, Italy. Methods: Phytosociological and phenological surveys were performed in a circular area of 1.5 km radius with a small apiary placed in the centre. Polleniferous and nectariferous values of plant communities were assessed based on the cover and the polleniferous and nectariferous value of each constituting species. Honey production was quantified during the main flow (March-June) and subjected to melissopalynological analysis. Data were evaluated by ordination through principal components analysis and principal coordinates analysis. The latter utilized a new index, developed for calculating the phenological distances based on the individual distributions of flowering frequencies. Results: Plant communities richest in species providing pollen and nectar were Rhamnus hedges. There was a close correlation between polleniferous and nectariferous values, suggesting that plant communities are important for honeybee foraging of both resources. The temporal flowering sequence ensured the supply of nectar and pollen throughout the spring season. Pollen foraged from 12 Trifolium species with different flowering phenology was the most abundant. Salix purpurea and Rhamnus alaternus were productive at the beginning of the season, followed by Lavandula stoechas, Echium plantagineum and E. italicum. Conclusions: Plant communities vary in importance for honeybee foraging mainly due to differences in floristic composition and flowering phenology. Communities characterized by human presence (e.g. semi-natural grasslands and hedges) are the most relevant. Some target species (e.g. Trifolium spp.) favoured by grazing livestock ensure foraging for honeybees throughout the season.

We start with general methods for preparing bees for behavioural assays. Then we introduce assays for quantifying sensory responsiveness to gustatory, visual and olfactory stimuli. Presentation of more complex behaviours like appetitive and aversive learning under controlled laboratory conditions and learning paradigms under free-flying conditions will allow the reader to investigate a large range of cognitive skills in honey bees. Honey bees are very sensitive to changing temperatures. We therefore present experiments which aim at analysing honey bee locomotion in temperature gradients. The complex flight behaviour of honey bees can be investigated under controlled conditions in the laboratory or with sophisticated technologies like harmonic radar or RFID in the field. These methods will be explained in detail in different sections. Honey bees are model organisms in behavioural biology for their complex yet plastic division of labour. To observe the daily behaviour of individual bees in a colony, classical observation hives are very useful. The setting up and use of typical observation hives will be the focus of another section. The honey bee dance language has important characteristics of a real language and has been the focus of numerous studies. We here discuss the background of the honey bee dance language and describe how it can be studied. Finally, the mating of a honey bee queen with drones is essential to survival of the entire colony. We here give detailed and structured information how the mating behaviour of drones and queens can be observed and experimentally manipulated.

The accessory long gland-reservoir complex of the wasp Leptopilina heterotoma (Figitidae) produces venom with virus-like particles. Upon delivery, venom components delay host larval development and completely block host immune responses. The host range of this Drosophila endoparasitoid notably includes the highly-studied model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. Categorization of 827 unigenes, using similarity as an indicator of putative homology, reveals that approximately 25% are novel or classified as hypothetical proteins. Most of the remaining unigenes are related to processes involved in signaling, cell cycle, and cell physiology including detoxification, protein biogenesis, and hormone production. Analysis of L. heterotoma's predicted venom gland proteins demonstrates conservation among endo- and ectoparasitoids within the Apocrita (e.g., this wasp and the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis) and stinging aculeates (e.g., the honey bee and ants). Enzyme and KEGG pathway profiling predicts that kinases, esterases, and hydrolases may contribute to venom activity in this unique wasp.

The Hymenoptera, in particular, have evolved life-histories requiring reliable spatial memories to support the task of provisioning their young. Behavioural experiments, primarily on social bees and ants, reveal the mechanisms by which these memories are employed for guidance to spatial goals and suggest how the memories, and the processing streams that use them, may be organized. We discuss three types of memory-based guidance which, together, can explain a large part of observed insect spatial behaviour. Two of these, alignment image-matching and positional image-matching, are based on an insect's remembered views of its surroundings: The first uses views to keep to a familiar heading and the second to head towards a familiar place. The third type of guidance is based on a process of path integration by which an insect monitors its distance and direction from its nest through odometric and compass information. To a large degree, these guidance mechanisms appear to involve modular computational systems. We discuss the lack of evidence for cognitive maps in insects, and in particular the evidence against a map based on path integration, in which view-based and path integration memories might be combined. We suggest instead that insects have a collective of separate guidance systems, which cooperate and train each other, and together provide reliable guidance over a range of conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Review,Scopus

One little-studied interaction is phoresy, where an individual of one species attaches itself to an individual of another species for the purpose of dispersal. Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are important crop pollinators around the world and at least 10 species of phoretic mites have been associated with various bumble bee species. Here, we investigated changes in the abundance of the introduced European B. terrestris across forest-grassland edges in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, and concomitant changes in the phoretic mite loads on these mobile pollinators. Bumble bees penetrated up to 250 m inside forest fragments, with abundance declining with distance from the anthropogenic matrix habitat. By contrast, phoretic mite loads increased towards the forest interior. Overall, phoretic mite loads on B. terrestris were greatest in the forest canopy, suggesting that this species interaction is intensified in natural habitat compared to that in the anthropogenic land use surrounding forest fragments.

Here we assessed how pollination services are delivered at the European scale. We used this assessment to estimate the relative contribution of wild pollinators to crop production. We developed an index of relative pollination potential, which is defined as the relative potential or relative capacity of ecosystems to support crop pollination. The model for relative pollination potential is based on the assumption that different habitats, but in particular forest edges, grasslands rich in flowers and riparian areas, offer suitable sites for wild pollinator insects. Using data of the foraging range of wild bees with short flight distances, we linked relative pollination potential to regional statistics of crop production. At aggregated EU level, the absence of insect pollination would result in a reduction of between 25% and 32% of the total production of crops which are partially dependent on insect pollination, depending on the data source used for the assessment. This production deficit decreases to 2.5% if only the relative pollination potential of a single guild of pollinators is considered. A strength of our approach is the spatially-explicit link between land cover based relative pollination potential and crop yield which enables a general assessment of the benefits that are derived from pollination services in Europe while providing insight where pollination gaps in the landscape occur. © 2013 by the authors.",Article,Scopus

(Common Lungwort) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Pulmonaria officinalis is a distylous, perennial rosette hemicryptophyte that is naturalized in Britain. It occurs predominantly in the understory of broadleaved, mixed, open woods rich in hornbeam, beech and oak, but is has also been recorded from hedges, banks alongside streams, (sunken) roadsides, built-up areas, gardens, rubbish tips, yew woodland and, less frequently, coniferous woodland. Its native range stretches from southern Sweden, in the north, to northern Italy, in the south, and from western Germany to Poland and Lithuania. It is most common in central Europe. Pulmonaria officinalis reproduces both by sexual and vegetative means. The underground parts consist of a slowly creeping rhizome with adventitious roots. Despite the presence of an elaiosome that is attractive to ants that likely facilitates seed dispersal, populations often show a significant fine-scale spatial genetic structure and small neighbourhood sizes. The leaves and flowering stalks are covered in hairs of varied length and stiffness, and stems and inflorescences are sparsely covered with glandular hairs. Flowers of P. officinalis are heterostylous, with distinct pin and thrum morphs. The corolla varies from purple, violet or blue to shades of pink and red, or sometimes white. The flowers are mainly pollinated by solitary bees and bumblebees. Pulmonaria officinalis has significantly expanded its distribution in the British Isles since the 18th century, especially in southern England. P. officinalis is currently not regarded as threatened in Europe. Nonetheless, small, isolated populations of the species often show reduced reproductive success and lower genetic diversity, potentially affecting their long-term survival. Preservation of local habitat conditions by regular opening of the forest canopy and restoration of gene flow among populations are required to maintain viable populations of P. officinalis in the long term. © 2013 British Ecological Society.",Article,Scopus

For pollinators, this has transformed the agrochemical landscape. These chemicals mimic the acetylcholine neurotransmitter and are highly neurotoxic to insects. Their systemic mode of action inside plants means phloemic and xylemic transport that results in translocation to pollen and nectar. Their wide application, persistence in soil and water and potential for uptake by succeeding crops and wild plants make neonicotinoids bioavailable to pollinators at sublethal concentrations for most of the year. This results in the frequent presence of neonicotinoids in honeybee hives. At field realistic doses, neonicotinoids cause a wide range of adverse sublethal effects in honeybee and bumblebee colonies, affecting colony performance through impairment of foraging success, brood and larval development, memory and learning, damage to the central nervous system, susceptibility to diseases, hive hygiene etc. Neonicotinoids exhibit a toxicity that can be amplified by various other agrochemicals and they synergistically reinforce infectious agents such as Nosema ceranae which together can produce colony collapse. The limited available data suggest that they are likely to exhibit similar toxicity to virtually all other wild insect pollinators. The worldwide production of neonicotinoids is still increasing. Therefore a transition to pollinator-friendly alternatives to neonicotinoids is urgently needed for the sake of the sustainability of pollinator ecosystem services. © 2013 The Authors.",Review,Scopus

Bee colonies exemplify a high level of intrinsic interdependence and co-ordination among its members, and algorithms inspired from the bee colonies have gained recent prominence in the field of swarm based metaheuristics. The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm was recently developed, by simulating the minimalistic foraging model of honeybees in search of food sources, for solving real-parameter, non-convex, and non-smooth optimization problems. The single parameter perturbation in classical ABC resulted in fairly commendable performance for simple problems without epistasis of variables (separable). However, it suffered from narrow search zone and slow convergence which eventually led to poor exploitation tendency. Even with the increase in dimensionality, a significant deterioration was observed in the ability of ABC to locate the optimum in a huge search volume. Some of the probable shortcomings in the basic ABC approach, as observed, are the single parameter perturbation instead of a multiple one, ignoring the fitness to reward ratio while selecting food sites, and most importantly the absence of environmental factors in the algorithm design. Research has shown that spatial environmental factors play a crucial role in insect locomotion and foragers seem to learn the direction to be undertaken based on the relative analysis of its proximal surroundings. Most importantly, the mapping of the forager locomotion from three dimensional search spaces to a multidimensional solution space calls forth the implementation of multiple modification schemes. Based on the fundamental observation pertaining to the dynamics of ABC, this article proposes an improved variant of ABC aimed at improving the optimizing ability of the algorithm over an extended set of problems. The hybridization of the proposed fitness learning mechanism with a weighted selection scheme and proximity based stimuli helps to achieve a fine blending of explorative and exploitative behaviour by enhancing both local and global searching ability of the algorithm. This enhances the ability of the swarm agents to detect optimal regions in the unexplored fitness basins. With respect to its immediate surroundings, a proximity based component is added to the normal positional modification of the onlookers and is enacted through an improved probability selection scheme that takes the T/E (total reward to distance) ratio metric into account.

Simulation models of pollination networks suggest that plant communities will be resilient to losing many or even most of the pollinator species in an ecosystem. These predictions, however, have not been tested empirically and implicitly assume that pollination efficacy is unaffected by interactions with interspecific competitors. By contrast, ecological theory and data from a wide range of ecosystems show that interspecific competition can drive variation in ecological specialization over short timescales via behavioral or morphological plasticity, although the potential implications of such changes in specialization for ecosystem functioning remain unexplored. We conducted manipulative field experiments in which we temporarily removed single pollinator species from study plots in subalpine meadows, to test the hypothesis that interactions between pollinator species can shape individual species' functional roles via changes in foraging specialization. We show that loss of a single pollinator species reduces floral fidelity (shortterm specialization) in the remaining pollinators, with significant implications for ecosystem functioning in terms of reduced plant reproduction, even when potentially effective pollinators remained in the system. Our results suggest that ongoing pollinator declines may have more serious negative implications for plant communities than is currently assumed. More broadly, we show that the individual functional contributions of species can be dynamic and shaped by the community of interspecific competitors, thereby documenting a distinct mechanism for how biodiversity can drive ecosystem functioning, with potential relevance to a wide range of taxa and systems.",Article,Scopus

The initial stretch of the full flight is characterized by accelerating speed, whereas the disintegrating swarm flew steadily at low speed. The two scouts in the swarm displaying full flight performed characteristic flight maneuvers. They flew at high speed when traveling in the direction of their destination and slowed down or returned over short stretches at low speed.

Yet, not all species are mobile enough to perform sufficient dispersal. Such passive dispersers may use more mobile animals as dispersal vectors. If multiple potential vectors are available, an active choice can allow to optimize the dispersal process and to determine the distribution of dispersal distances, i.e. an optimal dispersal kernel. We explore dispersal and vector choice in the neotropical flower mite Spadiseius calyptrogynae using a dual approach which combines experiments with an individual-based simulation model. Spadiseius calyptrogynae is found in lowland rainforests in Costa Rica. It inhabits inflorescences of the understorey palm Calyptrogyne ghiesbreghtiana and is phoretic on a number of flower visitors including bats, beetles and stingless bees. We hypothesised that the mites should optimise their dispersal kernel by actively choosing a specific mix of potential phoretic vectors. In a simple olfactometer setup we showed that the flower mites do indeed discriminate between potential vectors. Subsequently we used an individual-based model to analyse the evolutionary forces responsible for the observed patterns of vector choice. The mites combine vectors exhibiting long-distance dispersal with those allowing for more localized dispersal. This results in a fat-tailed dispersal kernel that guarantees the occasional colonization of new host plant patches (long distance) while optimizing the exploitation of clumped resources (local dispersal). Additionally, kin competition results in a preference for small vectors that transport only few individuals at a time. At the same time, these vectors lead to directed dispersal towards suitable habitat, which increases the stability of this very specialized interaction. Our findings can be applied to other phoretic systems but also to vector-based seed dispersal, for example. © 2013 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

It is believed that hive-mates detect airborne vibrations produced during the waggle phase to acquire distance information and simultaneously detect the body axis during the waggle phase to acquire direction information. It has been further proposed that the orientation of the body axis on the vertical comb is detected by neck hairs (NHs) on the prosternal organ. The afferents of the NHs project into the prothoracic and mesothoracic ganglia and the dorsal subesophageal ganglion (dSEG). This study demonstrates somatotopic organization within the dSEG of the central projections of the mechanosensory neurons of the NHs. The terminals of the NH afferents in dSEG are in close apposition to those of Johnston's organ (JO) afferents. The sensory axons of both terminate in a region posterior to the crossing of the ventral intermediate tract (VIT) and the maxillary dorsal commissures I and III (MxDCI, III) in the subesophageal ganglion. These features of the terminal areas of the NH and JO afferents are common to the worker, drone, and queen castes of honeybees. Analysis of the spatial relationship between the NH neurons and the morphologically and physiologically characterized vibration-sensitive interneurons DL-Int-1 and DL-Int-2 demonstrated that several branches of DL-Int-1 are in close proximity to the central projection of the mechanosensory neurons of the NHs in the dSEG. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Article,Scopus

Many of the arguments deployed in opposition to these restrictions were misleading, and based upon flawed research, much of it funded by neonicotinoid manufacturers themselves. The two principal arguments against restricting neonicotinoids were that yields would suffer, and that farmers would resort to older, even more harmful chemicals. However, evidence from Italy, where neonicotinoids have been banned from use on maize since 2008, suggests the opposite. Moreover, the EU precautionary approach on neonicotinoids represents a potential turning point for acting more widely to replace highly hazardous chemical pesticides with effective and sustainable alternatives. To achieve this, collaborative effort is needed on the part of governments, industry, civil society organisations, retailers and others. The Pesticide Action Network UK (PAN UK) welcomes the recent decision by the European Commission (EC) to place a temporary suspension on some uses of the three neonicotinoid pesticides, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and clothianidin. We believe that the steps taken by the Commission are a measured and reasonable response to the conclusions on the unacceptable risks posed to wild pollinators as identified in the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reports on these actives (EFSA, 2013). The new measures introduced in April by the EC, following much discussion and debate, mean that these three actives can no longer be used as seed treatments on any flowering crop that is attractive to bees. This is for a provisional period of two years starting in December 2013, to allow Member States to assess the impact, positive or negative, this will have on bee populations. PAN UK recognises that neonicotinoids, and indeed other pesticides, are not the only threats facing wild pollinators. Other pressures, including access to forage, disease and parasites, have all been implicated in the alarming declines in pollinator populations witnessed in recent years. Nevertheless, the European restrictions provide a small window of opportunity in which it should be possible, given the correct incentives and support from a range of stakeholders, to adopt more holistic agro-ecological approaches to pest management in the crops that are affected by the temporary restrictions. © 2013 Research Information Ltd.

In contrast, total orchid bee abundance varied significantly only over time (P = 0.0001), but not among the different mosaic elements (P = 0.05). Fragment size and distances between the fragments have affected species composition and abundance of some few common species. Most local species were present in the rubber plantation, and several species were using this matrix as a source of odor. The seasonal quality shifting of this matrix (leaf fall) has had less influence on the spatial distribution of orchid bees than the distances between forest fragments and fragment sizes.

We assessed the importance of climatic factors and geographic gradients on the distribution of orchid bees in a severely-fragmented and species-rich tropical forest region in Brazil. Orchid-bee males were attracted to 17 different scent baits and collected in 15 forest sites. In total we captured 11,081 bees from 40 species. Climatic variables explained twice as much of the observed variation in the bee species data set as did pure spatial variation. However, most of the climatic explained variation was spatially structured, indicating that the species and the climatic data have a similar spatial arrangement. In fact, part of the observed latitudinal changes in community composition appears to be explained by a concomitant gradient in precipitation seasonality. Similarly, reduced temperatures and a more seasonal precipitation may help to explain the relative distinctiveness of the fauna from some of the westernmost sites. The level of similarity among the sampled sites, although highly variable, decayed both as function of the climatic and geographic distances among these sites. The greatest pairwise dissimilarities in the composition of the orchid-bee fauna were observed among sites 200-300 km from each other, since in many case those sites were more dissimilar in terms of climate than those further apart. It is suggested that global warming and consequent altered climatic regimes will influence the distribution patterns of orchid bees in a region already threatened by deforestation and forest fragmentation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Article,Scopus

We investigated the relationship between waggle-phase duration and crop volume in foragers (both dancers and dance followers) leaving the hive. Our findings indicate that these variables were positively correlated in the two types of bee, suggesting that they were able to adjust the amount of food that they carry depending on the distance to a food source. We also found that dance followers left the hive with a larger amount of honey than dancers. We suggest two possible explanations: (1) dance followers have less information about the location of the food source than dancers, who have a better knowledge of the surrounding area; or (2) honeybees lack a precise calibration method for estimating energy needs from waggle-run duration. The effect of foraging experience was confirmed: bees decreased their honey load at departure with repeated trips to a sugar-syrup feeder. Honeybees showed a different pattern of change when the feeder provided soybean flour as a pollen substitute, possibly because honeybees use honey not only as an energy source but also as ""glue"" to form ""balls"" of pollen on their hind legs. Based on our observations that followers of sugar-syrup foragers carry a different amount of honey in their crop than followers of soybean-followers, we suggest that waggle dancers also convey information concerning food type. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus

A further challenge is to use them to predict changes in the assemblages of other groups. Using data from a study of the impact of land use on biodiversity, the linkages between management drivers, a range of plant functional traits and the overall foraging numbers and assemblage of bees was assessed. Bee foraging numbers were only weakly predicted by plant traits, though bee foraging assemblage was closely related to a number of different groups of plant traits (flower colour and Forage Index, as well as taxonomic group). In turn, the selected traits were significantly correlated to some of the response traits that linked the plant assemblage to management, indicating that there was a predictive pathway from management to bee abundance and assemblage structure. However, models developed with just the environmental drivers proved superior at predicting both bee numbers and assemblage. Plant traits proved to be a moderately effective predictor of bee assemblage structure. However, the use of plant traits as a link between the bees and management did not offer any improvement on models directly developed from management variables.

We used mass-flowering oilseed rape fields as locations to sample bees of this complex, as well as the second most common visitor to oilseed rape B. lapidarius, and molecular RFLP methods to distinguish between the cryptic species. We then used microsatellite genotyping to identify sisters and estimate colony densities, and related both proportions of cryptic species and their colony densities to the composition of the landscape surrounding the fields. We found B. lucorum was the most common member of the complex present in oilseed rape followed by B. terrestris. B. cryptarum was also present in all but one site, with higher proportions found in the east of the study area. High numbers of bumblebee colonies were estimated to be using oilseed rape fields as a forage resource, with B. terrestris colony numbers higher than previous estimates from non-mass-flowering fields. We also found that the cryptic species responded differently to surrounding landscape composition: both relative proportions of B. cryptarum in samples and colony densities of B. lucorum were negatively associated with the amount of arable land in the landscape, while proportions and colony densities of other species did not respond to landscape variables at the scale measured. This suggests that the cryptic species have different ecological requirements (which may be scale-dependent) and that oilseed rape can be an important forage resource for many colonies of bumblebees.

It is important to understand the way they move in agricultural landscapes if we are to conserve them and benefit from their activity as pollinators. We surveyed bees using directional flight interception (Malaise) traps over a 1-year period in two agricultural landscapes in south-east Queensland, Australia. We placed traps at the ecotone between crops and remnant vegetation to establish the pattern of movement between these habitats. Species richness in these landscapes (70) was high relative to that in comparable studies. Some bees were active year round, but most were caught in the period September to March. Across the whole assemblage there was a significant pattern where more species were detected leaving rather than entering remnant vegetation. The same bias was true for the number of individuals of the two most abundant species (Homalictus urbanus and Apis mellifera). Species exclusively found in crops were smaller on average (and therefore have smaller foraging range) than their non-crop counterparts. Together, these patterns indicate that while bees are abundant in crop habitat, the remnant vegetation is important as the point of origin for bee movements, and the riparian remnant in particular is richer than the dry native remnant. Compositional similarity among samples was significantly explained by landscape but also movement direction (i.e. to or from the riparian remnant) because different species showed different patterns of response.

We first consider color pattern variation and identify geographical patterns of B. bifarius color variation using cluster analysis. We then use climate data and a comprehensive set of B. bifarius natural history records with an existing genetic data set to model the distribution of environmentally suitable habitat in western North America and predict pathways of potential gene flow using circuit theory.

For the purpose of estimating parameters of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) model, and inspired by the foraging behavior of bacteria and bees, a hybrid artificial bee colony (HABC) algorithm is proposed. The HABC uses an improved solution search equation that mimics the chemotactic effect of bacteria to enhance the local search ability. To avoid premature convergence and improve search accuracy, the adaptive Boltzmann selection scheme is adopted, which adjusts selective probabilities in different stages. Performance testing has been conducted on some typical benchmark functions. The results demonstrate that the HABC outperforms other methods (BIPOA, PSOPS and two improved GAs) in both convergence speed and accuracy. The proposed approach is applied to estimate the PEMFC model parameters and the satisfactory model predictive curves are obtained. More experimental results in different search ranges and validate strategies indicate that HABC is an efficient technique for the parameter estimation problem of PEMFC.

The food reserves decreased with the increase of rainfall, and there was a significant correlation between intertegular span, corbicular area, and food stores. The corbiculae was inversely correlated with food reserves, while the width of thorax was positively related. We consider the allometric variation of thorax width and corbicular area as a mechanism to adjust colonial food collection, since larger corbiculae would maximize the pollen-gathering during the rainy, dearth periods, and when the resource supply increases, the workers increase in the width of thorax, being able to explore larger areas and replenish the colonial food stores. © 2012 INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.",Article,Scopus

Bee abundance and richness were higher in diversified and organic fields and in landscapes comprising more high-quality habitats; bee richness on conventional fields with low diversity benefited most from high-quality surrounding land cover.

Bumblebee foragers show diurnal rhythms under daily light:dark cycles and short-period free-running circadian rhythms in constant light conditions in the laboratory. In contrast, during the continuous light conditions of the arctic summer, they show robust 24-h rhythms in their foraging patterns, meaning that some external zeitgeber must entrain their circadian clocks in the presence of constant light. Although the sun stays above the horizon for weeks during the arctic summer, the light quality, especially in the ultraviolet (UV) range, exhibits pronounced daily changes. Since the photoreceptors and photopigments that synchronize the circadian system of bees are not known, we tested if the circadian clocks of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) can be entrained by daily cycles in UV light levels. Bumblebee colonies were set up in the laboratory and exposed to 12 h:12 h UV + :UV- cycles in otherwise continuous lighting conditions by placing UV filters on their foraging arenas for 12 h each day. The activity patterns of individual bees were recorded using fully automatic radiofrequency identification (RFID). We found that colonies manipulated in such a way showed synchronized 24-h rhythms, whereas simultaneously tested control colonies with no variation in UV light levels showed free-running rhythms instead. The results of our study show that bumblebee circadian rhythms can indeed be synchronized by daily cycles in ambient light spectral composition.© Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",Article,Scopus

Our study describes the consequences of edge creation over two successive stages in the life cycle of a hemi-parasitic mistletoe (Tristerix corymbosus), which determine its reproductive success, in temperate austral forests. We assessed how flower production and pollinator visits change with distance to the nearest forest edge and how these changes affect fruit set, fruit and seed size, and fruit removal by seed dispersers. Edge effects were dominated by fruit removal, which increased with the distance to the edge, height in the canopy and fruit availability. As a result, plant reproduction (in terms of seeds produced and fruits removed, which putatively leads to higher seed dispersal) decreased strongly near to forest edges. In contrast, visitation rates of the main pollinator (the hummingbird) were unaffected by edges, and their strong effects on fruit set (including the alleviation of quality pollen limitation arising in the forest interior) might be mitigating the decrease in bumblebee visitation near to forest edges. Synthesis. Our study shows clearly how secondary and tertiary responses to forest edges acted in opposite directions (increasing or decreasing plant reproductive performance), highlighting the need to study several successive processes that impact upon plant fitness under disturbance. Preserving relatively large patches of old-growth forest with low perimeter/area ratios would be key to the habitat requirements of the main disperser and pollinator and thus for mistletoe reproductive performance. © 2013 The Authors.

We report on an in-depth exploration of an iterative improvement heuristic model of bumblebee traplining previously found to accurately replicate the establishment of stable routes by bees between flowers distributed over several hectares. The critical test for a model is its predictive power for empirical data for which the model has not been specifically developed, and here the model is shown to be consistent with observations from different research groups made at several spatial scales and using multiple configurations of flowers. We refine the model to account for the spatial search strategy of bees exploring their environment, and test several previously unexplored predictions. We find that the model predicts accurately 1) the increasing propensity of bees to optimize their foraging routes with increasing spatial scale; 2) that bees cannot establish stable optimal traplines for all spatial configurations of rewarding flowers; 3) the observed trade-off between travel distance and prioritization of high-reward sites (with a slight modification of the model); 4) the temporal pattern with which bees acquire approximate solutions to travelling salesman-like problems over several dozen foraging bouts; 5) the instability of visitation schedules in some spatial configurations of flowers; 6) the observation that in some flower arrays, bees' visitation schedules are highly individually different; 7) the searching behaviour that leads to efficient location of flowers and routes between them.

It is theorized that insects, such as ants and bees, employ visual homing methods to return to their nest. Visual homing has been applied to autonomous robot platforms using two main approaches: holistic and feature-based. Both methods aim at determining distance and direction to the goal location. Navigational algorithms using Scale Invariant Feature Transforms (SIFT) have gained great popularity in the recent years due to the robustness of the feature operator. Churchill and Vardy have developed a visual homing method using scale change information (Homing in Scale Space, HiSS) from SIFT. HiSS uses SIFT feature scale change information to determine distance between the robot and the goal location. Since the scale component is discrete with a small range of values, the result is a rough measurement with limited accuracy. We have developed a method that uses stereo data, resulting in better homing performance. Our approach utilizes a pan-tilt based stereo camera, which is used to build composite wide-field images. We use the wide-field images combined with stereo-data obtained from the stereo camera to extend the keypoint vector described in to include a new parameter, depth (z). Using this info, our algorithm determines the distance and orientation from the robot to the goal location. We compare our method with HiSS in a set of indoor trials using a Pioneer 3-AT robot equipped with a BumbleBee2 stereo camera. We evaluate the performance of both methods using a set of performance measures described in this paper. © 2013 SPIE-IS&T.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Principal component analysis of environmental factors (bulk density, penetration resistance, water content and temperature) indicated that A. camellia preferred loose, moist and low-temperature habitats. The favored habitats were located at the bases of the foothills a long distance from human settlements. At the bases, favored nesting substrates decreased along the distance gradient, and nest densities of digger bees increased along the distance gradient. On the summit, however, nesting substrates were compacted, dried with high temperature regardless of distance from human settlements, and the nest densities were all low along the distance gradient.

Under certain environmental conditions asexual reproduction is predominant, which generates ecological consequences on sexual fecundity. In this context, we studied the reproductive ecology of the creeping clonal cactus Echinopsis thelegona in La Bodega (Salta, Argentina), where low fruit and seed production was preliminarily observed. Specifically, we studied the flower availability, fruit and seed production, reproductive system, floral visitors and effects of neighbor ramets on reproductive success. The number of available flowers per day was low, and fruit production was low or null as well. Echinopsis thelegona is self-incompatible. Although its flowers have sphingophilous traits, we did not find evidence of moths visiting them. Only native and exotic bees visited the flowers of this species, though with a low number of visits. Therefore, nocturnal visitors were not registered as pollinators of E. thelegona, perhaps because of their low local abundances. On the other hand, bees behaved as inefficient pollinators of E. thelegona due to their foraging behavior, which moves pollen within individuals. A pollen-addition experiment revealed that there is no fruit production at short distances among ramets. Therefore, the combination of self-incompatibility, low flower production and low local abundance of pollinators could account for the low fruit production observed in this species. This finding suggests that populations of E. thelegona persist by clonality and that they tend toward the loss of sexuality. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",Article,Scopus

Mobility is believed to allow species to mediate competitive interactions quickly and thus highly mobile species may appear randomly assembled in local communities. At larger scales, however, biogeographical processes could cause communities to be either phylogenetically clustered or even. Using phylogenetic community analysis we examined patterns of relatedness and trait similarity in communities of bumble bees (Bombus) across spatial scales comparing: local communities to regional pools, regional communities to continental pools and the continental community to a global species pool. Species composition and data on tongue lengths, a key foraging trait, were used to test patterns of relatedness and trait similarity across scales. Although expected to exhibit limiting similarity, local communities were clustered both phenotypically and phylogenetically. Larger spatial scales were also found to have more phylogenetic clustering but less trait clustering. While patterns of relatedness in mobile species have previously been suggested to exhibit less structure in local communities and to be less clustered than immobile species, we suggest that mobility may actually allow communities to have more similar species that can simply limit direct competition through mobility. © 2013 Harmon-Threatt, Ackerly.",Article,Scopus

This makes them excellent candidates for studying mechanisms of learning and memory at both an individual and a population level. Here we introduce a novel method of honey bee conditioning: APIS, the Automatic Performance Index System. In an enclosed walking arena where the interior is covered with an electric grid, presentation of odours from either end can be combined with weak electric shocks to form aversive associations. To quantify behavioural responses, we continuously monitor the movement of the bee by an automatic tracking system. We found that escapes from one side to the other, changes in velocity as well as distance and time spent away from the punished odour are suitable parameters to describe the bee's learning capabilities. Our data show that in a short-term memory test the response rate for the conditioned stimulus in APIS correlates well with response rate obtained from conventional Proboscis Extension Response (PER)-conditioning. Additionally, we discovered that bees modulate their behaviour to aversively learned odours by reducing their rate, speed and magnitude of escapes and that both generalisation and extinction seem to be different between appetitive and aversive stimuli. The advantages of this automatic system make it ideal for assessing learning rates in a standardised and convenient way, and its flexibility adds to our toolbox for studying honey bee behaviour. © 2013 Kirkerud, Wehmann, Galizia and Gustav.",Article,Scopus

They thus obtain similar views of the nest and its surroundings on their learning and return flights. How do bees coordinate their flights relative to nest-based and compass-based reference frames to get such similar views? We show, first, that learning and return flights contain straight segments that are directed along particular compass bearings, which are independent of the orientation of a bee's body. Bees are thus free within limits to adjust their viewing direction relative to the nest, without disturbing flight direction. Second, we examine the coordination of nest-based and compassbased control during likely information gathering segments of these flights: Loops during learning flights and zigzags on return flights. We find that bees tend to start a loop or zigzag when flying within a restricted range of compass directions and to fly towards the nest and face it after a fixed change in compass direction, without continuous interactions between their nest-based and compass-based directions of flight. A preferred trajectory of compass-based flight over the course of a motif, combined with the tendency of the bees to keep their body oriented towards the nest automatically narrows the range of compass directions over which bees view the nest. Additionally, the absence of interactions between the two reference frames allows loops and zigzags to have a stereotyped form that can generate informative visual feedback. © 2013.

We investigated pollen dispersal and fruit production in a population of Vaccinium oxycoccos, an insect-pollinated shrub, and compared the pollen dispersal pattern with a co-flowering, sympatric congener, V. uliginosum. We examined whether they share pollinators (through interspecific fluorescent dye transfers) and may differently attract pollinators, by comparing their floral colour as perceived by insects. Fluorescent dyes were mainly dispersed over short distances (80% within 40.4m (max. 94.5m) for V. oxycoccos and 3.0m (max. 141.3m) for V. uliginosum). Dye dispersal in V. oxycoccos was not significantly affected by plant area, floral display or the proximity to V. uliginosum plants. Interspecific dye transfers were observed, indicating pollinator sharing. The significantly lower dye deposition on V. oxycoccos stigmas suggests lower visitation rates by pollinators, despite higher flower density and local abundance. The spectral reflectance analysis indicates that bees are unlikely to be able to discriminate between the two species based on floral colour alone. Fruit production increased with increasing floral display, but was not affected by proximity to V. uliginosum plants. Our study highlights that fragmented populations of V. oxycoccos, when sympatric with co-flowering V. uliginosum, might incur increased competition for the shared pollinators in the case of pollination disruption, which might then reduce outcrossed seed set. © 2012 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Article,Scopus

Because of the severity and unusual circumstances of these colony declines, scientists named this phenomenon colony collapse disorder (CCD). Reports indicate that beekeepers in most states have been affected. Overall, the number of managed honey bee colonies dropped an estimated 35.8% and 31.8% in the winters of 2007/2008 and 2006/2007, respectively. Preliminary loss estimates for the 2008/2009 winter are reported at 28.6%. To date, the precise reasons for colony losses are not yet known.Honey bees are the most economically valuable pollinators of agricultural crops worldwide. Scientists at universities and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) frequently assert that bee pollination is involved in about one-third of the U.S. diet, and contributes to the production of a wide range of fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, forage crops, some field crops, and other specialty crops. The monetary value of honey bees as commercial pollinators in the United States is estimated at about $15-$20 billion annually.Honey bee colony losses are not uncommon. However, losses in recent years differ from past situations in that colony losses are occurring mostly because bees are failing to return to the hive (which is largely uncharacteristic of bee behavior); bee colony losses have been rapid; colony losses are occurring in large numbers; and the reason(s) for these losses remains largely unknown.Based on the available research over the past few years on the numerous possible causes of CCD, USDA concluded in its 2007-2008 progress report (released in June 2009) that ""it now seems clear that no single factor alone is responsible for the malady."" This has led researchers to further examine the hypothesis that CCD may be ""a syndrome caused by many different factors, working in combination or synergistically."" Currently, USDA states, researchers are focusing on three major possibilities: • pesticides that may be having unexpected negative effects on honey bees;• a new parasite or pathogen that may be attacking honey bees, such as the parasite Nosema ceranae or viruses; and• a combination of existing stresses that may compromise the immune system of bees and disrupt their social system, making colonies more susceptible to disease and collapse. Stresses could include high levels of infection by the Varroa mite; poor nutrition due to apiary overcrowding, pollination of crops with low nutritional value, or pollen or nectar scarcity; exposure to limited or contaminated water supplies; and migratory stress.Funding for honey bee and CCD research at USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has increased sharply, following both the enactment of the 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) and the FY2009 and FY2010 appropriations process (P.L. 111-8 and P.L. 111-80, respectively). These legislative actions contained additional provisions that would, among other things, provide additional funding for research and conservation programs addressing honey bees and pollinators. Total ARS funding for honey bee and CCD research averaged more than $7.7 million each in FY2007 and FY2008, increasing to $8.3 million in FY2009 and $9.8 million for FY2010. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The death of bees has been correlated with the use of neonicotinoid-coated seed and the toxic particulates emitted by pneumatic drilling machines. The contamination of foragers in flight over the ploughed fields has been hypothesized. The airborne contamination has been proven, both with bees inside fixed cages around the field and in free flight near the driller. A new trial involving mobile cages has been established and consists of making rapid passes with single bees inside cages fixed to an aluminium bar. The bar was moved by two operators at different distances from the working drilling machine. A single pass was shown as sufficient to kill all the bees exposed to exhaust air on the emission side of the drill, when bees were subsequently held in high relative humidity. The extent of toxic cloud around driller was evaluated at the height of 0.5, 1.8 and 3.5m and proved to be about 20m in diameter, with an ellipsoidal shape. The shape may be influenced by working speed of the drill and environmental parameters, and is easily shown by adding talc powder to the seed in the machine hopper. A new driller equipment was evaluated consisting of two tubes inclined towards the soil that direct the exhaust air towards the ground. The survival rate of the bees was not substantially increased using the modified drill and was lower than 50%. Chemical analyses show up to 4000ng of insecticide in single bees with an average content around 300ng. Similar quantities were observed at increased distances from the modified or unmodified drillers. This new evaluation of bee mortality in the field is an innovative biological test to verify the hypothetical efficiency (or not) of driller modifications. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.",Article,Scopus

The aim of this study is to investigate how the characteristics of waggle dances for natural food sources and environmental factors affect dance follower behaviour. Because food source profitability tends to decrease with increasing foraging distance, we hypothesised that the attractiveness of a dance, measured as the number of dance followers and their attendance, decreases with increasing distance to the advertised food location. Additionally, we determined whether time of year and dance signal noise, quantified as the variation in waggle run direction and duration, affect dance follower behaviour. Our results suggest that bees follow fewer waggle runs as the food source distance increases, but that they invest more time in following each dance. This is because waggle run duration increases with increasing foraging distance. Followers responded to increased angular noise in dances indicating more distant food sources by following more waggle runs per dance than when angular noise was low. The number of dance followers per dancing bee was also affected by the time of year and varied among colonies. Our results provide evidence that both noise in the message, that is variation in the direction component, and the message itself, that is the distance of the advertised food location, affect dance following. These results indicate that dance followers may pay attention to the costs and benefits associated with using dance information. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus

Using a population genetics approach, we determine the impact of habitat and floral resource distributions on nesting and foraging patterns of a critical native pollinator, Bombus vosnesenskii. Our findings demonstrate that native bee foraging is far more plastic and extensive than previously believed and does not follow a simple optimal foraging strategy. Rather, bumble bees forage further in pursuit of species-rich floral patches and in landscapes where patch-to-patch variation in floral resources is less, regardless of habitat composition. Thus, our results reveal extreme foraging plasticity and demonstrate that floral diversity, not density, drives bee foraging distance. Furthermore, we find a negative impact of paved habitat and a positive impact of natural woodland on bumble bee nesting densities. Overall, this study reveals that natural and human-altered landscapes can be managed for increased native bee nesting and extended foraging, dually enhancing biodiversity and the spatial extent of pollination services.",Article,Scopus

This study investigated the latter. We moved three colonies housed in observation hives onto the campus from a site 26 km away and compared their foraging performance to three similarly sized colonies at the same location that had not been moved. We obtained data on (1) foraging performance by calculating distance by decoding waggle dances, (2) hive foraging rate by counting forager departure rate, (3) forage quality by assessing sugar content of nectar from returning foragers, and (4) forager success by calculating the proportion of bees returning to the nest entrance with nectar in their crop. We repeated this 3 times (August 2010, October 2010, and June 2011) to encompass any seasonal effects. The data show no consistent difference in foraging performance of moved versus resident hives.

Moreover, species' responses to land-use change may differ depending on their life history traits such as dispersal ability, trophic level, or sociality. We assessed species richness and life history traits of wild bees in 32 calcareous grasslands in central Germany that differ in size, connectivity, resource availability and landscape context. Declining habitat area and, to a lesser degree, reduced diversity of the surrounding landscape were the key factors negatively influencing species richness. In the community-wide analysis, small body size and solitary reproduction were traits that made species particularly vulnerable to habitat loss. Contrary to our expectations, cleptoparasitic species were not more affected by reduced habitat area and landscape diversity than nest-building species. We performed further detailed trait analyses within the family Halictidae to prevent possible confounding effects due to trait correlations across families. Here, social as opposed to solitary species were more affected by habitat loss. We conclude that the opposite pattern observed for all social bees was mainly caused by large-sized social bumblebee species with high mobility and large foraging distances. Our results demonstrate the risks of concealed trait interference when analyzing community-wide patterns of life history traits. As a consequence, conservation requirements of small social bee species might be overlooked by generalizations from community responses. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Article,Scopus

Past experiments have shown that bumble bees cannot always develop accurate (i.e., repeatable) traplines to a sufficient level, despite their economic advantages in many situations. The bees' preference for short flights works against developing accurate traplines when plants or patches are distributed in zigzag fashion. How should bees cope with such situations in nature? We conducted laboratory experiments with artificial flowers to test 2 nonexclusive hypotheses: bees may travel faster to compensate for low traplining accuracy, and when local landmarks are available, bees may be able to develop traplines by remembering external spatial information in addition to the locations of flowers. As predicted, foragers on a zigzag-shaped floral array traveled faster, with lower route repeatability, than those on a triangular lattice where distance and angle could be chosen independently, suggesting that bees trade-off accuracy for speed when it is more feasible. In contrast, bees traveled more slowly with unchanged traplining accuracy when landmarks were added into both arrays, possibly because the landmarks caused information load or visual distraction. Finally, bees on the zigzag array with additional landmarks made a quicker decision to switch from accurate traplining to fast traveling. If landmarks helped the bees to grasp the overall array geometry in our experiments, they may also permit bees in nature to select a distribution of plants or patches that aids accurate traplining. © 2012 The Author.",Article,Scopus

This hard optimization problem consists of embedding an n-vertex graph into the cycle Cn, such that the minimum distance (measured in the cycle) of adjacent vertices is maximized. It constitutes a natural extension of the well-known antibandwidth problem, and can be viewed as the dual problem of the cyclic bandwidth problem. Our method hybridizes the artificial bee colony methodology with tabu search to obtain high-quality solutions in short computational times. Artificial bee colony is a recent swarm intelligence technique based on the intelligent foraging behavior of honeybees. The performance of this algorithm is basically determined by two search strategies, an initialization scheme that is employed to construct initial solutions and a method for generating neighboring solutions. On the other hand, tabu search is an adaptive memory programming methodology introduced in the eighties to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems. Our hybrid approach adapts some elements of both methodologies, artificial bee colony and tabu search, to the cyclic antibandwidth problem. In addition, it incorporates a fast local search procedure to enhance the local intensification capability. Through the analysis of experimental results, the highly effective performance of the proposed algorithm is shown with respect to the current state-of-the-art algorithm for this problem. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Increased production of novel crops for bioenergy is causing changes in agricultural practice, but the effects on different pollinating taxa have not yet been quantified. However, the major pollinating groups (social bees, solitary bees, hoverflies and butterflies) are likely to respond differently to changes in land use and shifts in crop cultivation patterns. We assessed the impacts of two bioenergy crops, oilseed rape Brassica napus L. and Miscanthus Miscanthus X giganteus on (i) the diversity and abundance of four taxonomic groups of pollinating insects, (ii) insect community composition, (iii) floral resources and (iv) nesting sites for bumblebees, by comparing bioenergy crops with conventional arable and grass crops in a large network of commercial fields. We found that although there were more bumblebees in oilseed rape fields, conventional crops and bioenergy crops did not differ greatly in species richness of most pollinator groups, although more floral resources were found in the bioenergy crops. However, solitary bees were more abundant and species rich in energy crops than conventional wheat, and more trap-nesting bees and wasps were found in Miscanthus than oilseed rape. In addition, novel assemblages of solitary bees were found in the bioenergy crops. All pollinator groups, and flowering plants, were more abundant in field margins than in the centre of crop fields. Although there were no differences among crop types, nest-searching bumblebees were confined to field margins. This highlights the importance of field margins as forage and nesting habitat for pollinators in farmland. Synthesis and applications. Differential responses to field-scale growth of bioenergy crops were displayed by the taxonomic groups studied, suggesting that effects on biodiversity cannot be generalized from studies based on a small suite of taxonomic groups and must include a range of taxa for overarching results. To optimize habitat for pollinators in agricultural areas, our data suggest that a diversity of crop types at small scales may have positive impacts and supports appropriate management and conservation of field margins and hedgerows during conversion to bioenergy production.

Schima wallichii is a highly valuable tree of tropical forest in north-east Himalaya region that grows naturally in a wide range of altitudes between 750 and 2400 m asl with varying environments. Flowering phenology of tropical tree species at population level is generally ignored and therefore a detailed knowledge of flowering and fruiting patterns of important multipurpose tree species is critical to the successful management of forest genetic resources. Materials and Methods. The study was conducted at two different altitudes (i.e., 750 m and 900 m asl) in the tropical semideciduous forest of north-east Himalaya. The floral phenology including flowering synchrony in the populations, anthesis, anther dehiscence, stigma receptivity, pollinators visitation frequency, and mating system including index of self-incompatibility were worked out in Schima wallichii according to the ear-marked standard methods given by various scientists for each parameter. Results. The flowering period in Schima wallichii varied from 33 to 42 days with mean synchrony of 0.54 to 0.68 between the populations. The stigma was receptive up to 2.5 days only and showed slightly protandrous type of dichogamy. Average pollen production ranged between 6.90 × 107 pollen per tree in 2007 and 15.49 × 108 pollen per tree in 2011. A three-year masting cycle was noticed in this species. The frequency of visitation of honey bees was fairly high (5.2 ± 1.12 visits/flower/hour) as compared to other pollinators. The hand pollination revealed maximum fruit (74.2 ± 5.72%) and seed (70.8 ± 7.46%) settings. Conclusions. The variation in flowering phenology and pollen yield individually and annually along with temporal separation in anther dehiscence and pollinator's visitation cause pollen limited reproduction, which ultimately influences the reproductive success in Schima wallichii. © 2013 Vinod Prasad Khanduri et al.",Article,Scopus

The competition for pollination leads to decreasing in seed production of competing species. However, there exists a variety of adaptations that allow plants to reduce the intensity of competition. A comparative analysis of pollinators spectra has allowed to designate groups (subcomplexes) of plants with regard to dominance of various groups of pollinators: myiophylous (flies from the superfamily Muscomorha dominate), syphidophylous (flies from the family Syrphidae dominate), psychophylous (butterflies dominate), cantharophylous (beetles dominate), nonspecialized and specialized melittophylous (Apidae, mainly bumblebees, dominate). The belonging of plants to a specific subcomplex is defined mainly by the structure of flowers and inflorescences. Modes of mechanical and attractive isolation are discussed that lead to restriction of pollinators composition. Competition abatement between species with similar spectra of pollinators and belonging to the same subcomplex is achieved mainly by spatial (ecological) and temporal (different timing of flowering) isolation.",Article,Scopus

The fractal and superdiffusive properties of Lévy walks can be advantageous when searching for randomly and sparsely distributed resources, prompting the suggestion that Lévy walks represent an evolutionary optimal searching strategy. The suggestion is supported by a plethora of empirical studies which have revealed that many organisms (a diverse range of marine predator, honeybees, Escherichia coli) have movement patterns that can approximated by Lévy walks. Nonetheless, Lévy walks with their strange fractal geometry appear alien to biology and their relevance to biology has been hotly debated.

This research has sought to identify biologically plausible mechanisms by which organisms can execute Lévy walks and to demonstrate that these movement patterns have a utility beyond the understanding and prediction of optimal searching patterns.

The honey bee Apis mellifera provides an excellent platform for investigating the relationship between brain gene expression and behavior given both the remarkable behavioral repertoire expressed by members of its intricate society and the degree to which behavior is influenced by heredity and the social environment. Here, we review a linked series of studies that assayed changes in honey bee brain transcriptomes associated with natural and experimentally induced changes in behavioral state. These experiments demonstrate that brain gene expression is closely linked with behavior, that changes in brain gene expression mediate changes in behavior, and that the association between specific genes and behavior exists over multiple timescales, from physiological to evolutionary. © 2012 by Annual Reviews.",Review,Scopus

However, due to the wide foraging range, field observations of water foraging bees are difficult to carry out. Therefore, samples of returning bees were collected in front of the entrance early in the morning as well as during the day in summer and autumn 2010. In the laboratory, honey sacs of bees without pollen or propolis were examined. Honey sac samples with a weight of ≥0. 005 g were classified as successful foragers. For the determination of water or nectar foragers, the honey sac contents of successful foragers were analyzed with a refractometer. Due to the dilution and the precision of the refractometer, an accuracy of 5 % was possible. Based on the known range of sugar concentrations in nectars, the analyzed samples were divided into nectar foragers (25-65 % sugar) and water foragers (0-15 % sugar). The study reveals that nectar and water foraging bees can be discriminated by analyzing the honey sac extracts with a refractometer. In autumn, the water demand of honey bee colonies is almost exclusively covered by water collection, whereas during summer nectar is mainly used as a substitute for water.

One key to more effective cooperative interaction in a multi-robot team is the ability to understand the behavior and intent of other robots. This is similar to the honey bee 'waggle dance' in which a bee can communicate the orientation and distance of a food source. In this similar manner, our heterogenous multi-robot team uses a specific behavior to indicate the location of mine-like objects (MLOs). Observed teammate action sequences can be learned to perform behavior recognition and task-assignment in the absence of communication. We apply Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to perform behavior recognition as an approach to task monitoring in the absence of communication in a challenging underwater environment. In order to demonstrate the use of behavior recognition of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in a cooperative task, we use trajectory based techniques for model generation and behavior discrimination in experiments using simulated scenario data.

These in turn are expected to respond to plant population size and flower density. High floral densities for example usually attract large numbers of pollinators that visit more flowers per plant or patch, which increases pollen deposition at short distances. Thus, population characteristics might serve as indicators for pollen dispersal patterns and help to identify suitable habitat size and quality for conservation measures. To test this hypothesis, we observed floral visitors of a generalist, entomophilous species, Comarum palustre, and compared their abundance and visitation rates in populations of different sizes and flower densities. At the same time, we mimicked pollen flow using fluorescent dye. In the large and dense populations, pollinator abundance and visitation rates were high and dye was dispersed to the edges of the populations (up to 200. m). In the medium-sized population with high flower density, insect abundance and visitation rates were unexpectedly low and dye dispersal declined very quickly. On the contrary, in the smallest population with scattered flowers, especially bumble bee abundance was similar to the large populations and dye dispersal mirrored this high bumble bee activity. Thus, our results indicate that in smaller habitat fragments, the mere size of a population might be insufficient to suggest pollen flow for a plant species. Instead, the abundance of its major pollinators should be considered. © 2012 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Article,Scopus

This research describes how the internal structures of the artificial nests of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris L.

For the first time, B. terrestris nest structures, and their contents such as larvae, pupae and eggs, were non-invaseively viewed and assessed. This technique will enable future experiments to take morphological measurements of egg, larval, and pupal development over time. Moreover, combining these measurements with measures of food-storage will provide a good assessment of colony health. The method will also allow tracking of individually marked adults, to monitor their behaviour and help gain a better understanding of the processes involved in the global declines of B. terrestris, which will in turn promote better management of these valuable pollinators. © This is an open access paper.

Each of the algorithms draws inspiration from biologic bee foraging/nest-site selection behavior. The main focus will be on the third algorithm, namely STIGMERGIC LANDMARK FORAGING which is a novel hybrid approach. It combines the high performance of bee-inspired navigation with ant-inspired recruitment. More precisely, navigation is based on Path Integration which results in vectors indicating the distance and direction to a destination. Recruitment only occurs at key locations (i.e., landmarks) inside of the environment. Each landmark contains a collection of vectors with which visiting agents can find their way to a certain goal or to another landmark in an unknown environment. Each vector represents a local segment of a global route. In contrast to ant-inspired recruitment, no attracting or repelling pheromone is used to indicate where to go and how worthwhile a route is in comparison to other routes. Instead, each vector in a landmark has a certain strength indicating how worthwhile it is. In analogy to ant-inspired recruitment, vector strength can be reinforced by visiting agents. Moreover, vector strength decays over time. In the end, this results in optimal routes to destinations.

Although solid, the resulting cast was not brittle and was not damaged during excavation, transportation and measurement. The volume of the cast was quickly and easily determined via weighing, fluid displacement and photogrammetry and the three volume measures varied by only 3%. The primary value of the cast was that it could be inverted and placed under a good light source for close examination, measurement and photography. The digital model of the digging was visually detailed and instantaneously showed measurements, including volume, surface area and maximum length, width and depth. Mechanical and photogrammetric linear measurements made on the surface of the cast and digital model were statistically identical. The principal cost of the digital modelling was the time required to learn to use the software and complete the modelling (42.5 hours).

As such, the daily in-and-out activity of a beehive could be automatically recorded with minimum interference with the regular behavior of the bees. The components of the imaging system include: (1) an infrared LED light source; (2) an infrared CCD camera and a personal computer for image acquisition and processing; and (3) an acrylic passageway to temporarily confine the bees within the image-capturing range of the camera. In operation, this imaging system was affixed to the outside of a beehive at the entry/exit point. To identify each forager of bee workers individually, circular character-encoding tags were attached to the dorsum of the bees' thoraxes. To locate individual honey bees in a video frame, a circular Hough transform was used to detect the presence of the circular tags. A black positioning dot on the tag was used to identify the orientation of the characters in order to facilitate the reading of the symbols on the circular tag. The extracted character symbols were further segmented and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was deployed to recognize the characters and identify the individual honey bee. The system developed in this study was used in experimentation to identify each of the tagged bees and to record the timing of the entries and exits. The character symbol recognition and identification accuracy rates of the system were about 98% and 86%, respectively. Based on the in-and-out records, daily foraging behavior of honey bees were analyzed and presented.

Whether foraging honeybees can make similarly complex navigational decisions from locations away from the hive is unknown. To examine whether or not such secondary decision-makinghubs exist, we trained bees to forage at four different locations. Specifically, we trained honeybees to first forage to a distal site ""CT"" 100 m away from the hive; if food was present, they fed and then chose to go home. If food was not present, the honeybees were trained to forage to three auxiliary sites, each at a different time of the day: A in the morning, B at noon, and C in the afternoon. The foragers learned to check site CT for food first and then efficiently depart to the correct location based upon the time of day if there was no food at site CT. Thus, the honeybees were able to cognitively map motivation, time, and five different locations (Hive, CT, A, B, and C) in two spatial dimensions; these are the contents of the cognitive map used by the honeybees here. While at site CT, we verified that the honeybees could choose between 4 different directions (to A, B, C, and the Hive) and thus label it as a secondary decision-making hub. The observed decision making uncovered here is inferred to constitute genuine logical operations, involving a branched structure, based upon the premises of motivational state, and spatiotemporal knowledge. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

Focal exploration comes first- the departing bee turns around to face the return target and oscillates in a lateral flight pattern of increasing amplitude and distance. Thereafter, for the peripheral exploration, the forward flying bee circles the return-goal area with expanding and alternating clockwise and counterclockwise arcs. After this two- part proximal exploration follows distal exploration, the bee flies straight towards her potential distal goal. For the return path, supported by the preceding exploratory learning, the return navigational performance is expected to reflect the three exploratory parts in reverse order. Previously only two performance parts have been experimentally identified: focal navigation and distal navigation.Here we discovered peripheral navigation as being distinct from focal and distal navigation. Like focal navigation, yet unlike distal navigation, peripheral navigation is invariably triggered by local place recognition. Whereas focal navigation (orientation) is close to unidirectional, peripheral navigation makes use of multiple goal-vector knowledge.

We provide the first evidence that the stingless bee Melipona panamica utilizes optic flow information to gauge not only distance traveled but also height above ground, by processing information primarily from the lateral visual field. After training bees to forage at a set height in a vertical tunnel lined with black and white stripes, we observed foragers that explored a new tunnel with no feeder. In a new tunnel, bees searched at the same height they were trained to. In a narrower tunnel, bees experienced more image motion and significantly lowered their search height. In a wider tunnel, bees experienced less image motion and searched at significantly greater heights. In a tunnel without optic cues, bees were disoriented and searched at random heights. A horizontal tunnel testing these variables similarly affected foraging, but bees exhibited less precision (greater variance in search positions). Accurately gauging flight height above ground may be crucial for this species and others that compete for resources located at heights ranging from ground level to the high tropical forest canopies. © 2012.

Despite being taxonomically widespread, these routing behaviours remain poorly understood due to the difficulty of tracking the foraging history of animals in the wild. Here we examine how bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) develop and optimise traplines over large spatial scales by setting up an array of five artificial flowers arranged in a regular pentagon (50 m side length) and fitted with motion-sensitive video cameras to determine the sequence of visitation. Stable traplines that linked together all the flowers in an optimal sequence were typically established after a bee made 26 foraging bouts, during which time only about 20 of the 120 possible routes were tried. Radar tracking of selected flights revealed a dramatic decrease by 80% (ca. 1500 m) of the total travel distance between the first and the last foraging bout. When a flower was removed and replaced by a more distant one, bees engaged in localised search flights, a strategy that can facilitate the discovery of a new flower and its integration into a novel optimal trapline. Based on these observations, we developed and tested an iterative improvement heuristic to capture how bees could learn and refine their routes each time a shorter route is found. Our findings suggest that complex dynamic routing problems can be solved by small-brained animals using simple learning heuristics, without the need for a cognitive map. © 2012 Lihoreau et al.",Article,Scopus

This study examined the visitation rates and foraging patterns of eight taxonomic groups of bees that are common to California poppies, Eschscholzia californica, in both landscape types. Bee occurrence was documented in relation to floral resource characteristics (patch area, poppy coverage, and poppy density), local landscape characteristics (distance to the wildland-urban interface, distance to riparian areas, distance to green space, and land use), and regional landscape context (urban versus wildland). Similar abundance and richness measures were recorded at both urban and wildland poppy patches, but community composition varied in each landscape. Bumble bees were more abundant at poppies in the wildland whereas species in the family Halictidae (sweat bees) were more abundant at poppies within the urban landscape. Resource patch size and density consistently correlated with increased bee presence for all bee types foraging in the wildland. Individual patterns of occurrence in the urban landscape were somewhat divergent; the foraging dynamics of larger bodied-bees (Bombus vosnesenskii and Megachile species) correlated significantly with resource patch size and density, whereas smaller-bodied bees (family Halictidae and Andrena species) were influenced by landscape characteristics such as distance to the wildland-urban interface and distance to riparian areas. In summary, the surrounding landscape had an influence on community composition, but the magnitude of the floral resource present at a site and factors relating to foraging energetics were dominant drivers of local occurrence. These results suggest that management strategies that provide dense and abundant floral resources should be successful in attracting bees, irrespective of their location within the urban matrix. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Article,Scopus

The biologic mechanisms that generate fine-scale spatial genetic structure are not fully understood. We studied fine-scale spatial genetic structure in ten coexisting dipterocarp tree species in a Bornean rain forest using microsatellite markers. Six of the ten species showed statistically significant fine-scale spatial genetic structure. Fine-scale spatial genetic structure was stronger at smaller spatial scales (≤ 100 m) than at larger spatial scales (> 100 m) for each species. Multiple regression analysis suggested that seed dispersal distance was important at the smaller spatial scale. At the larger scale (> 100 m) and over the entire sample range (0-1000 m), pollinators and spatial distribution of adult trees were more important determinants of fine-scale spatial genetic structure. Fine-scale spatial genetic structure was stronger in species pollinated by less mobile small beetles than in species pollinated by the more mobile giant honeybee (Apis dorsata). It was also stronger in species where adult tree distributions were more clumped.

One communication system where these alternatives are debated is the honeybee (Apis mellifera) waggle dance. Successful foragers communicate resource locations to nest-mates by a dance comprising repeated units (waggle runs), which repetitively transmit the same distance and direction vector from the nest. Intra-dance waggle run variation occurs and has been hypothesized as a colony-level adaptation to direct recruits over an area rather than a single location. Alternatively, variation may simply be due to constraints on bees' abilities to orient waggle runs. Here, we ask whether the angle at which the bee dances on vertical comb influences waggle run variation. In particular, we determine whether horizontal dances, where gravity is not aligned with the waggle run orientation, are more variable in their directional component. We analysed 198 dances from foragers visiting natural resources and found support for our prediction. More horizontal dances have greater angular variation than dances performed close to vertical. However, there is no effect of waggle run angle on variation in the duration of waggle runs, which communicates distance. Our results weaken the hypothesis that variation is adaptive and provide novel support for the constraint hypothesis. This journal is © 2012 The Royal Society.",Article,Scopus

This review describes a range of experiments carried out with free-flying forager honeybees under such conditions.The research done over the past 30 or so years suggests that cognitive abilities (learning and perception) in insects are more intricate and flexible than was originally imagined. It has become apparent that honeybees are capable of a variety of visually guided tasks, involving decision making under challenging situations: this includes simultaneously making use of different sensory modalities, such as vision and olfaction, and learning to use abstract concepts such as ""sameness"" and ""difference."" Many studies have shown that decision making in foraging honeybees is highly flexible. The trained animals learn how to solve a task, and do so with a high accuracy, but when they are presented with a new variation of the task, they apply the learnt rules from the earlier setup to the new situation, and solve the new task as well. Honeybees therefore not only feature a rich behavioral repertoire to choose from, but also make decisions most apt to the current situation. The experiments in this review give an insight into the environmental cues and cognitive resources that are probably highly significant for a forager bee that must continually make decisions regarding patches of resources to be exploited.",Review,Scopus

Pollen from nests collected in 1998-1999 without spatial information was also identified. Bees used pollen of at least 64 species; many of these occurred in only one collection. The 2007 collections contained pollen of 35 different species, but were dominated by five species, especially Hura crepitans L. and Pseudobombax septenatum (Jacq.) Dugand.

Workers from 10 fields collected over 2 yr were assigned to full sibling families (colonies) by using eight microsatellite loci. With estimation of numbers of unseen species, we inferred the presence of 189 colonies from 433 bees genotyped in year 1, and 144 from 296 genotyped the next year. Worker foraging distance was estimated to be at least 11.6 km, half the distance between the most remote fields visited by the same colonies. Numbers of nests contributing workers to each field ranged from 15 to 163. Overall, 165 (50%) colonies foraged in two or more fields, and thus used common resources within the landscape.

Forager bees that are typically older than 3. weeks of age show strong behavioral and molecular circadian rhythms with higher activity during the day. Younger bees that typically care for ("" nurse"" ) the brood are active around the clock with similar brain clock gene levels throughout the day. However, nurses that are caged on brood-less combs inside or outside the hive show robust circadian rhythms with higher activity during the day, suggesting that direct contact with the brood mediates the plasticity in the circadian system. The nature of the brood signals affecting the workers' circadian system and the modalities by which they are detected are unknown. Given that the antennae are pivotal sensory organs in bees, we hypothesized that they are involved in mediating the brood influence on the plasticity in circadian rhythms. The flagella of the antennae are densely covered with diverse sensory structures able to detect a wide range of signals. To test our hypothesis, we removed the flagella of nurses and observed their behavior in isolation and in free-foraging colonies. We found that individually-isolated flagella-less bees under constant laboratory conditions show robust circadian rhythms in locomotor activity. In observation hives, flagella-less bees cared for the brood, but were more active during the day. By contrast, sham-treated bees were active around the clock as typical of nurses. Detailed video recordings showed that the brood-tending behavior of flagella-less and sham-treated bees is similar. These observations suggest that the difference in the patterns of brood care activity is not because the flagella-less bees did not contact the brood. Our results suggest that nurses are able to find the brood in the dark environment of the hive without their flagella, perhaps by using other sensory organs. The higher activity of flagella-less bees during the day further suggests that the flagella are involved in mediating the brood signals modulating plasticity in the circadian system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus

There were four floral visitors; bumble bee (Apis braviceps Smith), honey bee (Apis cerena), fruit fly (Bactocera sp.) and moth (Udaspes folus), and among them A. braviceps was found to be the major pollinator due to its high pollination efficiency attributed to its big body size and foraging habit, while A. cerena acts as a pollen robber.

Previous studies have demonstrated that concentrations of metals in adult honeybees were significantly higher at polluted than at control locations. These studies focused at a limited range of heavy metals and highly contrasting locations, and sampling was rarely repeated over a prolonged period. In our study, the potential of honeybees to detect and monitor metal pollution was further explored by measuring the concentration in adult honeybees of a wide range of trace metals, nine of which were not studied before, at three locations in the Netherlands over a 3-month period. The specific objective of the study was to assess the spatial and temporal variation in concentration in adult honeybees of Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, Sr, Ti, V and Zn. In the period of July-September 2006, replicated samples were taken at 2-week intervals from commercial-type beehives. The metal concentration in micrograms per gram honeybee was determined by inductive coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Significant differences in concentration between sampling dates per location were found for Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn Sr, Ti and V, and significant differences in average concentration between locations were found for Co, Sr and V. The results indicate that honeybees can serve to detect temporal and spatial patterns in environmental metal concentrations, even at relatively low levels of pollution. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",Article,Scopus

The view that round dances and waggle dances are distinct recruitment signals has been revised in light of the finding that distance and direction information are encoded (albeit imprecisely) in round dances. It has remained unclear, however, whether dance followers can use the location information in round dances. In the present study, we looked at recruitment to nearby food sources and found that dance followers can use the directional information in the dances advertising these food sources. Directional bias in recruitment was found for food sources as close as 5. m from the hive. Controls for effects of assembly pheromone and bee presence at the advertised food sources indicate that these factors play a minimal role, relative to dance information, in producing the directional recruitment. Our results provide further support for the view that round dances are best viewed as waggle dances indicating nearby food sources, not as a separate type of dance. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Article,Scopus

Bees were either treated topically with 0.3, 1.5, and 3μg tau-fluvalinate or exposed to 0.05, 0.5, 5.0, 50, and 500 ppb imidacloprid in a sugar agar cube.

(honeybees, thiamethoxam) and Whitehorn et al., (bumblebees, imidacloprid) published in Science (2012) with exposure of bees, following the actual use of these neonicotinoids. A third study investigating sub-lethal effects on honeybees for clothianidin and imidacloprid was also considered (Schneider et al., 2012). Data of uses authorised in EU and data on residues in pollen and nectar were collected to compare the actual exposure of bees with the investigated doses. The residue data were limited and available only for some crops; therefore, the extrapolation to other crops was not considered appropriate. In the studies on honeybees, the highest residue levels of thiamethoxam, clothianidin and imidacloprid in nectar were compared with the actual concentrations tested. The results indicated that the tested concentrations were higher than the concentrations found in nectar. The residue intake was estimated using different exposure scenarios. The results indicated that the doses tested in these publications were lower for clothianidin and for thiamethoxam than the estimated exposure. For imidacloprid the doses tested were higher in all the scenarios. In the studies on honeybees, the total amount of active substance was consumed by honeybees within a relatively short period instead of being not administrated over a longer period i.e a day. In the study on bumblebees the tested concentrations were in the range of the highest residues of imidacloprid in pollen and nectar. However, the relevance of the exposure period in the study is unknown. The comparison between the doses tested in the studies with the actual doses with the exposure of bees was considered feasible only for the seed treatment uses to maize, sunflower, oilseed rape and alfalfa. Further data would be necessary before drawing a definite conclusion on the behavioural effects regarding sub-lethal exposure of foragers exposed to actual doses of neonicotinoids. © 2012 European Food Safety Authority",Article,Scopus

Consequently, the colony achieves an effective collection of food. However, it is still not fully understood how much effect the dance behavior has on the food collection, because most of the relevant experiments have been performed only in limited locations under limited experimental conditions. Here, we examined the efficacy of the waggle dances by physically preventing bees from dancing and then analyzing the changes in daily mass of the hive as an index of daily food collection. To eliminate place- and year-specific effects, the experiments were performed under fully natural conditions in three different cities in Japan from mid September to early October in three different years. Because the experiments were performed in autumn, all six of the tested colonies lost mass on most of the experimental days. When the dance was prevented, the daily reduction in mass change was greater than when the dance was allowed, i.e. the dance inhibited the reduction of the hive mass. This indicates that dance is effective for food collection. Furthermore, clear inhibition was observed on the first two days of the experiments; after that, inhibition was no longer evident. This result suggests that the bee colony adapted to the new environment. © 2012. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.",Article,Scopus

They retain this time memory for several consecutive days even in the absence of nectar rewards. Recent work has identified 2 classes of forager: ""persistent"" foragers that reconnoiter a known food source to ascertain its status and ""reticent"" foragers that apparently wait in the hive for a waggle dance confirming source availability. Surprisingly, a foraging group contains 40-90% persistent foragers, depending on experience at the source. What is the benefit in sending so many foragers to investigate a source when only a few foragers are required to reactivate the entire group? We used an agent-based software model to test the energetics underlying several different ratios of persistent and reticent individuals in the foraging group while varying 6 ecological factors: forager group size, source distance, source sucrose concentration, source availability in hours, number of days the source is known to the colony, and the rate at which new unemployed foragers appear on the dance floor. Our model demonstrates 2 primary explanations. First, a large number of persistent foragers are needed to ensure that at least some foragers will reconnoiter their source early in its availability, thus enabling the group to effectively exploit the source. Second, the cost of a reconnaissance flight is negligible compared with even a single successful foraging trip. © 2012 The Author.",Article,Scopus

Thus native plants possess certain traits that make them uniquely adapted to local conditions providing a practical and ecologically valuable alternative for landscaping, conservation and restoration of degraded ecosystems. Mexico's ecosystem is a vast one as the country covers a wide variety of terrains, soils and climates with different geography characteristics which favor the development of native species. For instance, in those arid and semiarid regions of northeastern Mexico there is an extensive native plant list of more than 3,100 species. Regions of the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico are dominated by a dense diversity of native plants. The vascular flora comprises 159 families, 1034 genera, 3181 species and 109 intraspecific taxa. The most diverse families are: Asteraceae (148 genera and 481 species), Poaceae (97 genera and 301 species), Fabaceae (76 genera and 258 species), Cactaceae (37 genera and 139 species) and Euphorbiaceae (15 genera and 85 species) among others. Native plant inventory in northeastern Mexico is mostly composed of deciduous and evergreen or perennial species which are characterized by a wide range of growth patterns, diversity in leaf longevity, dynamics of growth and contrasting phenological developments. This resource is used by the inhabitants of the region in various ways such as forage for livestock, coal, timber, shelving, food, herbal, medicine and seed supply for reforestation and ecological restoration. Additionally, the native plant provides a habitat for wildlife and a cover layer that prevent soil erosion. For these reasons native plants develop various morphological and physiological characteristics suitable for adaptation to adverse environmental factors, particularly drought stress and high temperatures.Numerous vegetal species account for the bulk of the bush vegetation providing a characteristic landscape. The most important of these plants consist of various species of Acacia including A. rigidula, A. farnesiana, A. berlandierii, A. smallii and A. tortuosa, and some other important species such as Prosopis laevigata, P. glandulosa, Leucaena leucocephala, Celtis pallida (desert hackberry), Condalia ericoides (javelina bush), Leucophyllum frutescens (cenizo or sometimes called purple sage), and Aloysia wrightii (common bee-brush or white brush). These species favor the retention of soil due to their high sprouting potential, ease of regeneration after frost and forest fires in addition to being accepted by the people so they may be used successfully to restore degraded areas and initiate programs aimed to the protection and conservation of forest elements in northeastern Mexico. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Population persistence in fragmented areas depends on dispersal potential and maintenance of gene flow among fragments of habitat. Here we used population genetic techniques to characterize, for two equally abundant orchid bee species that differ in their physiology and ecology, levels of genetic differentiation among fragments of tropical forest in southeastern Costa Rica in a ~200 km 2 landscape. We measured population differentiation with φ PT (an analogue to the traditional summary statistic Fst), as well as two measures that may more accurately reflect the level of differentiation when highly variable loci are used: G'st and D est. We also calculated pairwise genetic distances among individuals and conducted Mantel tests to test the correlation of genetic and geographic distance, for each species. We found strong differences in genetic structure between the species. Contrary to our expectations, each measure of genetic structure revealed that the larger-bodied species, Eulaema bombiformis, had higher levels of differentiation than the smaller species, Euglossa championi. Furthermore, for Eulaema bombiformis there was a significant positive correlation of genetic and geographic distance while for Euglossa championi there was no significant positive correlation. Our results demonstrate that bee species can have strikingly different levels of gene flow in fragmented habitats, and that body size may not always act as a useful proxy for dispersal, even in closely related taxa. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Article,Scopus

Benth., ex Kurz.) is an important medicinal plant. Flowers of this plant are protogynous and need cross-pollination for seed set. The characterization of its pollinators and pollination mode is, therefore, important. Entire ranges of flower visitors of sarpagandha were captured with hand net from its field and were identified. These visitors were characterized as pollinators and non-pollinators based on their mode of working on the flowers. Their relative abundances, foraging rates activity durations, number of pollen grains carried on the body, effect of multiple visits were used to determine their pollinating efficiencies. At Hisar (Haryana, India), nineteen insect species were found to visit the flower of sarpagandha. The insects visiting the flowers of sarpagandha showed two types of foraging modes. On the basis of these modes, the flower visitors were characterized as pollinators and non-pollinators. Some foragers of A. dorsata and A. mellifera were base-foragers (nectar thieves/non-pollinators). However, all the lepidopterous species and some of the hymenopterous species were exclusively front-foragers (pollinators). Most abundant were two species of butterflies viz. Papilio demoleus and Pieris brassicae and three species of bees viz. Mellisodes sp., Xylocopa fenestrata and Megachile sp. The peak activity of all the insect visitors was observed at 1300 h. Maximum duration of activity in the field was shown by Papilio demoleus. All the visitors carried excessively higher number of pollen grains on their bodies than required by the flower for fruit set. Incremental visits also did not have significant increase on the fruit set. Therefore, on the basis of population abundance, foraging mode, foraging rate and activity duration, pollinating efficiency of the visitors was determined, where in Papilio demoleus was ranked as the best pollinator of sarpagandha at Hisar, that confirmed our earlier belief about predominance of psychophilous mode of pollination (i.e., pollination by butterflies) in sarpagandha. © 2012 Academic Journals Ink.",Article,Scopus

We discuss possible strategies used during the establishment of stable multi-location routes (or traplines), and how these could allow bees and other animals to solve complex routing problems through experience, without necessarily requiring a sophisticated cognitive representation of space. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Article,Scopus

What bees see while navigating, depends on the appearance of the cues, the bee'current position, orientation, and movement relative to them. Here we analyze the detailed flight behavior during the localization of a goal surrounded by cylinders that are characterized either by a high contrast in luminance and texture or by mostly motion contrast relative to the background. By relating flight behavior to the nature of the information available from these landmarks, we aim to identify behavioral strategies that facilitate the processing of visual information during goal localization. We decompose flight behavior into prototypical movements using clustering algorithms in order to reduce the behavioral complexity. The determined prototypical movements reflect the honeybee's saccadic flight pattern that largely separates rotational from translational movements. During phases of translational movements between fast saccadic rotations, the bees can gain information about the 3D layout of their environment from the translational optic flow. The prototypical movements reveal the prominent role of sideways and up- or downward movements, which can help bees to gather information about objects, particularly in the frontal visual field. We find that the occurrence of specific prototypes depends on the bees' distance from the landmarks and the feeder and that changing the texture of the landmarks evokes different prototypical movements. The adaptive use of different behavioral prototypes shapes the visual input and can facilitate information processing in the bees' visual system during local navigation. © 2012 Braun, Dittmar, Boed-deker and Egelhaaf.",Article,Scopus

The loss of functionally important species can reduce a variety of ecosystem functions, such as pollination and seed dispersal, but the intricate relationships between land-use intensity, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are still contentious. Along a gradient from forest to intensively used farmland, we quantified bee species richness, visitation rates of bees and pollination success of wild cherry trees (Prunus avium). We analysed the effects of structural habitat diversity at a local scale and of the proportion of suitable habitat around each tree at a landscape scale. We compared these findings with those from previous studies of seed-dispersing birds and mammals in the same model system and along the same land-use gradient. Bee species richness and visitation rates were found to be highest in structurally simple habitats, whereas bird species richness-but not their visitation rates-were highest in structurally complex habitats. Mammal visitation rates were only influenced at the landscape scale. These results show that different functional groups of animals respond idiosyncratically to gradients in habitat and landscape structure. Despite strong effects on bees and birds, pollination success and bird seed removal did not differ along the land-use gradient at both spatial scales. These results suggest that mobile organisms, such as bees and birds, move over long distances in intensively used landscapes and thereby buffer pollination and seed-dispersal interactions. We conclude that measures of species richness and interaction frequencies are not sufficient on their own to understand the ultimate consequences of land-use intensification on ecosystem functioning. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

Alternative approaches include heuristic methods that employ iterative optimization procedures for detecting multiple circles. Since only one circle can be marked at each optimization cycle, multiple executions ought to be enforced in order to achieve multi-detection. This paper presents an algorithm for automatic detection of multiple circular shapes that considers the overall process as a multi-modal optimization problem. The approach is based on the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, a swarm optimization algorithm inspired by the intelligent foraging behavior of honeybees. Unlike the original ABC algorithm, the proposed approach presents the addition of a memory for discarded solutions. Such memory allows holding important information regarding other local optima, which might have emerged during the optimization process. The detector uses a combination of three non-collinear edge points as parameters to determine circle candidates. A matching function (nectar-amount) determines if such circle candidates (bee-food sources) are actually present in the image. Guided by the values of such matching functions, the set of encoded candidate circles are evolved through the ABC algorithm so that the best candidate (global optimum) can be fitted into an actual circle within the edge-only image. Then, an analysis of the incorporated memory is executed in order to identify potential local optima, i. e., other circles. The proposed method is able to detect single or multiple circles from a digital image through only one optimization pass. Simulation results over several synthetic and natural images, with a varying range of complexity, validate the efficiency of the proposed technique regarding its accuracy, speed, and robustness. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

Agricultural intensification and loss of wild floral resources rank among the main factors contributing to this decline. Landscape enhancement of floral resources has been proposed as an agro-environmental scheme intended to provide honeybees with compensatory food sources in intensive agrosystems. Floral scheme efficiency has rarely been evaluated with respect to landscape context. In this study, we developed and validated a modeling tool to delineate the landscape areas likely to be associated with higher efficiency of floral enhancement schemes. In particular, the proximity of some landscape elements used by honeybees, either as foraging habitat or as visual landmark for orientation, may partly determine floral scheme efficiency. We investigated this issue using resource selection functions (RSFs), i.e. models that aim to predict the occurrence of foraging honeybees at floral patches as a function of the presence of keystone landscape elements in their proximity. However, deciding which landscape elements are effectively in the proximity or not is mostly a matter of subjectivity. The novelty of our approach resides in its use of a distance-weighting function to explicitly account for the spatial location of surrounding landscape elements. In that respect, a distance function should be scaled on movement patterns of foraging organisms. Herein, we inferred movement patterns from the autocorrelative properties of honeybee foraging activity. This modeling approach was developed on Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia) field margin strips, a typical "" honeybee-friendly"" floral scheme. A foraging survey conducted on 170 Phacelia plots (2 m × 2. m) from 17 Phacelia strips, all positioned within the foraging range of an experimental apiary, revealed that (i) the floral scheme efficiency is positively influenced by the presence of linear landscape elements such as hedgerows and forest edges, but negatively affected by the presence of alternative floral resources, and that (ii) weighting the relative importance of those landscape elements by incorporating a distance function into models considerably improved their predictive power. This modeling tool has the potential to help land managers optimizing their financial investment by avoiding low-efficiency landscape areas, or favoring high-efficiency ones, at the time of planning floral enhancement schemes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

Monarch butterflies and locusts traverse continents [1, 2], and foraging bees and ants travel hundreds of meters to return to their nests [1, 3, 4], whereas many other insects fly straight for only a few centimeters before changing direction. Despite this variation in spatial scale, the brain region thought to underlie long-distance navigation is remarkably conserved [5, 6], suggesting that the use of a celestial compass is a general and perhaps ancient capability of insects. Laboratory studies of Drosophila have identified a local search mode in which short, straight segments are interspersed with rapid turns [7, 8]. However, this flight mode is inconsistent with measured gene flow between geographically separated populations [9-11], and individual Drosophila can travel 10 km across desert terrain in a single night [9, 12, 13] - a feat that would be impossible without prolonged periods of straight flight. To directly examine orientation behavior under outdoor conditions, we built a portable flight arena in which a fly viewed the natural sky through a liquid crystal device that could experimentally rotate the polarization angle.

A variety of stressors have been implicated as potential causes, including agricultural pesticides. Neonicotinoid insecticides, which are widely used and highly toxic to honey bees, have been found in previous analyses of honey bee pollen and comb material. However, the routes of exposure have remained largely undefined. We used LC/MS-MS to analyze samples of honey bees, pollen stored in the hive and several potential exposure routes associated with plantings of neonicotinoid treated maize. Our results demonstrate that bees are exposed to these compounds and several other agricultural pesticides in several ways throughout the foraging period. During spring, extremely high levels of clothianidin and thiamethoxam were found in planter exhaust material produced during the planting of treated maize seed. We also found neonicotinoids in the soil of each field we sampled, including unplanted fields. Plants visited by foraging bees (dandelions) growing near these fields were found to contain neonicotinoids as well. This indicates deposition of neonicotinoids on the flowers, uptake by the root system, or both. Dead bees collected near hive entrances during the spring sampling period were found to contain clothianidin as well, although whether exposure was oral (consuming pollen) or by contact (soil/planter dust) is unclear. We also detected the insecticide clothianidin in pollen collected by bees and stored in the hive. When maize plants in our field reached anthesis, maize pollen from treated seed was found to contain clothianidin and other pesticides; and honey bees in our study readily collected maize pollen. These findings clarify some of the mechanisms by which honey bees may be exposed to agricultural pesticides throughout the growing season. These results have implications for a wide range of large-scale annual cropping systems that utilize neonicotinoid seed treatments. © 2012 Krupke et al.",Article,Scopus

When two feeders were each placed 400 m away from the hive in different directions, a virtual colony in which honeybees danced and correctly transferred information (a normal, real bee colony) made significantly greater numbers of successful visits to the feeders compared to a colony with inaccurate information transfer. Howerer, when five feeders were each located 400 m from the hive, the inaccurate information transfer colony performed better than the normal colony.

One conspicuous threat to bumble bees is their unintended exposure to trace residues of systemic neonicotinoid pesticides, such as imidacloprid, which are ingested when bees forage on the nectar and pollen of treated crops. However, the demographic consequences for bumble bees of exposure to dietary neonicotinoids have yet to be fully established. To determine whether environmentally realistic levels of imidacloprid are capable of making a demographic impact on bumble bees, we exposed queenless microcolonies of worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, to a range of dosages of dietary imidacloprid between zero and 125 μg L -1 and examined the effects on ovary development and fecundity. Microcolonies showed a dose-dependent decline in fecundity, with environmentally realistic dosages in the range of 1 lg L-1 capable of reducing brood production by one third. In contrast, ovary development was unimpaired by dietary imidacloprid except at the highest dosage. Imidacloprid reduced feeding on both syrup and pollen but, after controlling statistically for dosage, microcolonies that consumed more syrup and pollen produced more brood. We therefore speculate that the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on fecundity emerge principally from nutrient limitation imposed by the failure of individuals to feed. Our findings raise concern about the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations. However, we recognize that to fully evaluate impacts on wild colonies it will be necessary to establish the effect of dietary neonicotinoids on the fecundity of bumble bee queens. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",Article,Scopus

We found that the majority of the males in a 1000 m 2 sampling area originated from colonies located outside of the workers foraging range, which was consistent with the genetic distances among colonies. The analyses of temporal population sub-structure based on both colony detection rate over time and the clustering software STRUCTURE consistently suggested one large and temporally unstructured male population.

These species are self-compatible and bee-pollinated, with ornamental potential and may be used for forage given their high nutritional value. We studied natural populations located in Lerma Valley, Salta Province, Argentina. In January and February 2009, we marked and bagged 10 floral buds from 10 individual plants per species. The flowers were collected before their senescence; anther-stigma separation was measured immediately after collection with digital calipers (0.01 mm) as the distance between the surface of the stigma and the nearest anther. The stigmas were preserved in 70% ethanol. Pollen grains were counted under a microscope (10×) in the laboratory. There was significant variation in herkogamy levels among species. There was a negative correlation between anther-stigma distance and the number of selfpollen grains deposited on the stigma in isolated flowers. The variation in levels of herkogamy may represent a mechanism to ensure the production of some selffertilized progeny in the absence of pollinators.",Conference Paper,Scopus

In addition to indicating the position (distance, direction) of a food patch, both the occurrence and frequency of the dances depend on the profitability of the exploited resource (sugar concentration, solution flow rate). During the waggle dance, successful foragers generate pulsed thoracic vibrations that putatively serve as a source of different kinds of information for hive bees, who cannot visually decode dances in the darkness of the hive. In the present study, we asked whether these vibrations are a reliable estimator of the excitement of the dancer when food profitability changes in terms of both sugar concentration and solution flow rate. The probability of producing thoracic vibrations as well as several features related to their intensity during the waggle phase (pulse duration, velocity amplitude, duty cycle) increased with both these profitability variables. The number of vibratory pulses, however, was independent of sugar concentration and reward rate exploited. Thus, pulse number could indeed be used by dance followers as reliable information about food source distance, as suggested in previous studies. The variability of the dancer's thoracic vibrations in relation to changes in food profitability suggests their role as an indicator of the recruiter's motivational state. Hence, the vibrations could make an important contribution to forager reactivation and, consequently, to the organisation of collective foraging processes in honey bees. © 2011.

After introducing a single highly rewarding flower to the array, they re-adjusted their routes visiting the most rewarding flower first provided the departure distance from the shortest possible route remained small (18%). When routes optimizing the initial rate of reward intake were much longer (42%), bees prioritized short travel distances. 4.Under natural conditions, in which individual flowers vary in nectar productivity and replenish continuously, it might pay bees to prioritize highly rewarding locations, both to minimize the overall number of flowers to visit and to beat competitors. 5.We discuss how combined memories of location and quality of resource patches could allow bees and other traplining animals to optimize their routing decisions in heterogeneous environments. © 2011 The Authors.

During nectar and pollen foraging in a temperate climate, honeybees are exposed to a broad range of ambient temperatures, challenging their thermoregulatory ability. The body temperature that the bees exhibit results from endothermic heat production, exogenous heat gain from solar radiation, and heat loss. In addition to profitability of foraging, season was suggested to have a considerable influence on thermoregulation. To assess the relative importance of these factors, the thermoregulatory behaviour of foragers on 33 flowering plants in dependence on season and environmental factors was investigated. 2. The bees (Apis mellifera carnica Pollman) were always endothermic. On average, the thorax surface temperature (Tth) was regulated at a high and rather constant level over a broad range of ambient temperatures (Tth = 33.7-35.7°C, Ta = 10-27°C). However, at a certain Ta, Tth showed a strong variation, depending on the plants from which the bees were foraging. At warmer conditions (Ta = 27-32°C) the Tth increased nearly linearly with Ta to a maximal average level of 42.6 °C. The thorax temperature excess decreased strongly with increasing Ta (Tth-Ta = 21.6 - 3.6°C). 3. The bees used the heat gain from solar radiation to elevate the temperature excess of thorax, head, and abdomen. Seasonal dependance was reflected in a 2.7 °C higher mean Tth in the spring than in the summer. An anova revealed that season had the greatest effect on Tth, followed by Ta and radiation. 4. It was presumed the foragers' motivational status to be the main factor responsible for the variation of Tth between seasons and different plants. © 2011 The Authors.

This species presents particular floral syndromes including violet, tubular flowers with trichome elaiophores that produce oil. Oil flowers are associated with specialised bees with an oil-collecting apparatus. To better understand the reproductive biology of M. aphylla, the mating system, flowering phenology, the associated pollinator assemblage and foraging behaviour was determined at the southern-most part of its distributional range. Results were compared with those of previous studies and discussed. At this southern location M. aphylla is a self-incompatible species; it relies on pollinators for fruit production and presented a low fruit set. Flowering occurred during the spring, from October to December. M. aphylla was pollinated by three species of bees (Apidae); two generalist species (Centris brethesi and Mesonychium jenseni) and one specialist to M. aphylla (Centris vardyorum). M. jenseni is a cleptoparasite of Centris species. Centris species are oil-collecting bees and showed territorial behaviour (i.e. they always visited a restricted group of plants which they protected from other visitors), they visited several flowers/plants, which enhanced geitonogamous self-pollination and reduced pollination efficiency, and which might explain the low natural fruit set observed in M. aphylla. C. vardyorum was the most important pollinator of M. aphylla in the study area. The reproductive biology of M. aphylla differs along its distributional range. Apparently, southern populations of M. aphylla are more specialised than the northern populations, the former being pollinated by a few related pollinator species whereas at the northern location a variety of visitors were observed. © 2011 CSIRO.",Article,Scopus

However, Eurasian columbines show similar taxonomic diversity despite to be mainly pollinated by bumblebees. This situation makes Eurasian columbines an ideal counterpoint to explore diversification process under low pollinator diversity but high environmental heterogeneity scenarios. In this paper we explore diversification rates and patterns of habitat (habitat and altitudinal range) transitions underlying the European columbines evolution. A density-dependent lineal model of diversification best fitted our data, which implies a lineal decrease of diversification rate through radiation. Our results point to an important role of habitat (14.3-15.8 habitat transitions) in driving European columbines diversification. Habitat and altitudinal range reconstruction showed a pattern from wide altitudinal range (encompassing 1000-1200 m) and generalist ancestors to narrow altitudinal ranges (= 800 m) and open-rocky habitats in more recent taxa (i.e. those species inhabiting mountains regions of South Europe). Ecological opportunity has been the preferred explanation for density-dependence diversification during a radiation. Glacial impacts on European flora and the coincidence of the initiation of the radiation with the onset of Mediterranean climate probably did generate ecological opportunities for niche expansion and habitat specialization and evolution. However, we suggest that some biological features of Aquilegia (low seed dispersal, small population sizes and frequent inbreeding depression) unrelated to ecological opportunity together with the orography might also be involved in density-dependent speciation and habitat evolution in this genus. Specifically, we propose that high geographical isolation between and within distinct South European peninsulas, restricted geographical range size and specialization on open-rocky habitats combined with low seed dispersal might have contributed to the density-dependence mode of diversification in European columbines.",Article,Scopus

We apply a reciprocal illumination procedure: (1) taxa recognized previously from morphology are used to stratify samples for DNA subsampling; (2) DNA barcodes from these subsamples are used to recognize groups of phylogenetically related specimens; and (3) for these groups, we re-examine morphological characters in order to recognize and diagnose species. A total of 3854 specimens from 1535 samples from across the geographic range of the subgenus throughout the Holarctic and northern Oriental regions are identified to 11 species. This includes one species newly recognized from Mongolia, Bombus mongolensis Williams sp. nov. Taxon concepts are modified substantially for four species, seven lectotypes are designated, and four new synonyms are recognized. The prevailing usage of Bombus distinguendus is maintained as valid by designating Bombus elegans as a nomen oblitum and designating B. distinguendus as a nomen protectum. Identification keys and colour-pattern diagrams are provided, and geographic distributions, elevational ranges, and phenological activity periods are described to characterize the species. An estimate of the biogeographic history is reconstructed with dispersal-vicariance analysis.

The local abundance of bumblebee species was studied in 22 semi-natural meadows located in Northeast Estonia. The proportion of forest cover and brushwood cover, the mean patch area of forest and the edge density of forest were calculated at four spatial scales (i.e., radii of 250 m, 500 m, 1000 m and 2000 m). In total, we found 597 individuals of bumblebees belonging to 24 species (gen. Bombus), including five species of cuckoo bumblebees (subgen. Psithyrus). Our study shows that some bumblebee species seem to have different preferences in terms of the structure of the landscape. Some species may benefit from a heterogeneous landscape with a high proportion of forest habitats (e.g., B. schrencki), whereas others seem to prefer open areas (e.g., B. veteranus). We also found that some bumblebee species that have large foraging distances (e.g., B. terrestris) seem to be negatively affected by forest, as the presence of a high quantity of forest patches in the surrounding landscape could narrow their foraging area. The joint effects of the set of landscape variables related with forests appear to be important for some bumblebee species, specially, but not only, at the largest spatial scale. Overall, our results indicate that the presence of forest is very important for bumblebees, even for some species that prefer open areas, as forest habitats and edges may offer overwintering sites and nesting places for them. In countries like Estonia, where forests are widely distributed and represent a relevant part of the landscape mosaic, this type of habitat should be preserved if conservation of biodiversity is desired. In addition, conservation efforts targeting particular species of bumblebees should consider the landscape preferences of the species under study, and these efforts should aim to maintain the habitat types that are suitable for most bumblebee species.",Article,Scopus

Bees have evolved multimodal communication to recruit nestmates to rewarding food sources. Highly social bees can use visual and chemical information to recruit nestmates to rich food sources. However, no studies have determined if this information is redundant or has an additive effect such that multimodal information is more attractive than either modality presented by itself to free-flying bees. We tested the effect of two modalities, forager-deposited odor marks and the visual presence of foragers, on the orientation of stingless bee (Scaptotrigona mexicana) recruits. Our results show that odor marks alone were significantly more attractive than multimodal information, and that multimodal information was significantly more attractive than visual forager presence alone. Given the high olfactory sensitivity and limited visual acuity of insects, odor marks likely attracted recruits over a greater distance than the visual presence of nestmates. Thus, multimodal information in S. mexicana is redundant, not additive, in terms of orientation to food sources. © 2011 International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).",Article,Scopus

Path integration and view-based landmark guidance are the key strategies for the ants' navigation. For instance, they memorise different views in a sequence (sequential memory) but also have a step counter that informs them about the covered distance during each foraging trip (odometer). The sequential memory and the odometer information can act as contextual cues during travel for retrieving the appropriate stored view. When and which cue is used at different stages and lengths of the foraging trips is still unknown. In this study, we examined how the Australian desert ant Melophorus bagoti uses sequential memory and odometric information to retrieve visual memories. Using a set-up made out of channels and two-choice boxes (Y-mazes), we demonstrate first that M. bagoti foragers are able to learn and discriminate a variety of visual stimuli in a sequence of views along the inbound trip back to the nest. We then forced the homing ants to encounter a fixed sequence of two visual patterns during their inbound trips. By manipulating the position and distance of the visual stimuli and decision boxes, we could set the two contextual cues (sequential memory and odometer) into conflict. After the short 4-m outbound distance, a preference for odometric information as a contextual cue was found, but after the long 8-m outbound distance, ants relied primarily on their sequential memory retrieval. Odometer precision deteriorates with increasing travel distance, and accordingly, our findings imply that desert ants may be relying on the most reliable contextual cue for retrieving visual memories. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

To investigate nuclear microsatellites population structure in A. cerana, single workers of A. cerana colonies from Thailand were genotyped at 18 microsatellite loci. The loci showed intermediate to high levels of heterozygosity and a range of allele numbers. The analyses confirmed a fundamental subdivision of the Thai A. cerana population into the ""Asia Mainland"" and ""Sundaland"" regions at the Isthmus of Kra. However, the nuclear microsatellite differentiation was less distinct than mtDNA haplotype differences, suggesting male-biased dispersal and population admixture. Overall, samples showed a weak isolation-by-distance effect. The isolated population on Samui island was most differentiated from the other samples. The results do not support our initial hypothesis of local host-pathogen co-evolution, which predicts a strict correspondence between the nuclear genome and the lineage of parasitic Varroa mite of the A. cerana samples, because the gene flow indicated by our nuclear microsatellite markers should also mix potential Varroa resistance alleles among subpopulations. Instead, our study suggests that the coincidental distribution of Varroa lineages and A. cerana population structure in Thailand are the result of biogeographic history and current migration patterns. © 2011 International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).",Article,Scopus

By far the most important contribution honey bees make to modern agriculture is the pollination services that they provide. Fifty-two of the 115 leading global food commodities depend on honey bee pollination for either fruit or seed set. Honey bee is the most ideal pollinator, and honey bee industry has played a vital role in maintenance of environment development and protection of ecological equilibrium. At present, propaganda should be vigorously carried out on the role of honey bee pollination in increasing agriculture production and protection of ecological equilibrium. Honey bees are a greatly valued resource all of the world. They are prized for their honey and wax production and depended upon for pollination of many important crops. While globally honey bee populations have been increasing, the rate of increase is not keeping pace with demand. Further, honey bee populations have not been increasing in all parts of the world, and have declined in many nations in Europe and in North America. In recent year, CCD has broken out many times in the global range, and the population number of honey bees has sharply declined, so the situation is worrisome. Managed honey bee populations are influenced by many factors including diseases, parasites, pesticides, the environment, and socio-economic factors. These factors can act alone or in combination with each other. Modern agriculture increasingly depends on the use of chemical substances to control weeds, fungi and arthropod pests to ensure high yields. Honey bees may frequently become exposed to environmental chemicals as a consequence of their foraging activities, and traditionally, the focus of pesticide regulations was more on protection of bees against direct poisoning. However, since the substances that are being used have changed, damage from acute toxicity is not the only threat to bees. Instead, sub-lethal effects such as paralysis, disorientation or behavioral changes, both from short-term and long-term exposure, increasingly come into focus. In contrast to direct poisoning of bees that is apparent and easily observable, sub-lethal effects of pesticides on honey bees and other pollinators are much more difficult to demonstrate. The evolution of beekeeping as a cultural practice and as a profession has resulted in the development and use of techniques that may ultimately reduce the vitality of honey bee colonies. Selective pressures on the bee population are routinely being influenced by management decisions like the regular use of medication to control parasites and diseases, the protection of hives against cold weather, and artificial feeding. Consequently, weak and susceptible colonies are kept alive and given a chance to participate in the reproductive process. Colonies that were treated against diseases or parasites may be selected over non-treated colonies that have been forced to cope with the pathogens, thereby lowering the natural resistance against diseases and other environmental selection factors in the honey bee population. With the development of modern agriculture, the traditional survival conditions for honey bees are destroyed in China, which has threatened the existence and sustainable development of the honeybees, evidenced by the constant substantial decreases in the number of honeybees. This review summarizes the changes in ecological conditions, introduces the main factors affecting the survival of honeybees, analyzes the reasons behind the difficult survival of honeybees, and based on which several countermeasures have been raised to address the problem as well as how to maintain strong honeybee colonies, as a reference for future research.",Review,Scopus

These include insect pollinators, to whom field margins provide both nest sites and important resources (especially when adjacent crops are not in flower). Nesting pollinators travel relatively short distances from the nest to forage: most species of bee are known to travel less than two kilometres away. In order to ensure that these pollinators have sufficient areas of wild land within reach of their nests, agricultural landscapes need to be designed to accommodate the limited travelling distances of nesting pollinators. We used a spatially-explicit modelling approach to consider whether increasing the width of wild strips of land within the agricultural landscape will enhance the amount of wild resources available to a nesting pollinator, and if it would impact differently on pollinators with differing foraging strategies. This was done both by creating field structures with a randomised geography, and by using landscape data based upon the British agricultural landscape. These models demonstrate that enhancing field margins should lead to an increase in the availability of forage to pollinators that nest within the landscape. With the exception of species that only forage within a very short range of their nest (less than 125 m), a given amount of field margin manipulation should enhance the proportion of land available to a pollinator for foraging regardless of the distance over which it normally travels to find food. A fixed amount of field edge manipulation should therefore be equally beneficial for both longer-distance nesting foragers such as honeybees, and short-distance foragers such as solitary bees. © 2011 Rands, Whitney.",Article,Scopus

Negative effects on the biota are numerous, ranging from interruption of gene flow among populations, to the loss of genetic diversity within populations, to a decline in species richness over time. Orchid bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Euglossini) are of major conservation interest due to their function as pollinators of numerous orchid species and other tropical plants. Here, we used microsatellite markers to investigate the effects of geographic distance and habitat fragmentation on gene flow among populations. Populations of Euglossa dilemma in three geographic regions-the Yucatán peninsula (Mexico), Veracruz (Mexico), and Florida (USA)-were genetically structured predominantly across the regions, with the strength of differentiation among populations being positively correlated with geographic distance. Within geographic regions only little substructure was found, suggesting that dispersal is substantial in the absence of geographic or ecological barriers. In a second study, patterns of genetic differentiation among eight species of Euglossa were not related to habitat fragmentation following deforestation in southern Mexico (Veracruz). Specifically, most bee populations in the 9,800 ha forest remnant of Los Tuxtlas (Volcano San Martin) were neither differentiated from, nor had less genetic diversity than, populations in near-continuous forest separated from Los Tuxtlas by 130 km of agricultural land. Either occasional long distance dispersal across open areas has buffered the expected genetic effects of fragmentation, or the history of fragmentation in southern Mexico is too recent to have caused measurable shifts in allelic composition. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Article,Scopus

The observation of active replication of the BQCVin the gut, together with the fact that BQCV was more widespread in the body offield-collected bees than that of lab-reared bees, implies a possible association between the foraging activities of bumble bees and virus transmission.

It was unintentionally introduced to North America in the late 1960s from Europe, and subsequently, into South America, New Zealand and the Canary Islands. We provide information on the local distribution, seasonal abundance and sex ratio of A. manicatum from samples collected in an intensive two-year survey across Utah, USA. Anthidium manicatum was detected in 10 of the 29 Utah counties, largely in urban and suburban settings. Combining presence-only and MaxEnt background data from literature, museum databases and new records from Utah, we constructed three species distribution models to examine the potential distribution of A. manicatum in its native Eurasian range as well as invaded ranges of North and South America. The A. manicatum model based on locality and background data from the species' native range predicted 50% of the invasive records associated with high habitat suitability (HS ≥ 0.90). The invasive North American model predicted a much broader distribution of A. manicatum (214% increase); whereas, the South American model predicted a narrower distribution (88% decrease). The poor predictive power of the latter model in estimating suitable habitats in the invasive South American range of A. manicatum suggests that the bee may still be limited by the bioclimatic constraints associated with a novel environment. Estimates of niche similarity (D) between the native and invasive models find that the North America bioclimatic niche is more similar to the bioclimatic niche of the native model (D=0.78), whereas the bioclimatic niche of the South America invasion is relatively dissimilar (D=0.69).

Semi-track air-cushion vehicle (STACV) provides a solution to transportation on soft terrain, whereas it also brings a new problem of excessive fuel consumption. By mimicking the foraging behaviour of honeybees, the bioinspired adaptive bees algorithm (ABA) is proposed to calculate its running parameters for fuel economy optimization. Inherited from the basic algorithm prototype, it involves parallel-operated global search and local search, which undertake exploration and exploitation, respectively. The innovation of this improved algorithm lies in the adaptive adjustment mechanism of the range of local search (called 'patch size') according to the source and the rate of change of the current optimum. Three gradually in-depth experiments are implemented for 143 kinds of soils. First, the two optimal STACV running parameters present the same increasing or decreasing trend with soil parameters. This result is consistent with the terramechanics-based theoretical analysis. Second, the comparisons with four alternative algorithms exhibit the ABA's effectiveness and efficiency, and accordingly highlight the advantage of the novel adaptive patch size adjustment mechanism. Third, the impacts of two selected optimizer parameters to optimization accuracy and efficiency are investigated and their recommended values are thus proposed. © The Author 2010.

Although social nests were much more frequent than solitary ones, they produced no more brood, so per capita brood productivity was actually lower for social females. Social females exhibited several reproductive strategies inferred from wing wear patterns, which reflect flight activity, and mandibular wear patterns, which reflect nest construction activity. Primary females accumulated a large degree of wing and mandibular wear and were presumed to be the primary reproductives in social nests. Secondary females accumulated less wing and mandibular wear and were probably subordinates awaiting opportunities to supersede primaries as dominant foragers and egg-layers. Tertiary females remained inactive, apparently deferring reproduction to the subsequent year.

Here we examine the population structure of the bumblebee Bombus hortorum in a model island system, the Western Isles of Scotland, using microsatellite markers. Following declines in other species, B. hortorum is the only remaining long-tongued bumblebee species found in much of Europe, and thus it is of particular ecological importance. Our data suggest that populations of B. hortorum in western Scotland exist as distinct genetic clusters occupying groups of nearby islands. Population structuring was higher than for other bumblebee species which have previously been studied in this same island group (Fst = 0. 16). Populations showed significant isolation by distance. This relationship was greatly improved by using circuit theory to allow dispersal rates to differ over different landscape features; as we would predict, sea appears to provide far higher resistance to dispersal than land. Incorporating bathymetry data improved the fit of the model further; populations separated by shallow seas are more genetically similar than those separated by deeper seas. We argue that this probably reflects events following the last ice age when the islands were first colonized by this bee species (8,500-5,000 ybp), when the sea levels were lower and islands separated by shallow channels would have been joined. In the absence of significant gene flow these genetic clusters appear to have since diverged over the following 5,000 years and arguably may now represent locally adapted races, some occurring on single islands. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Article,Scopus

As the European landscape is regimented through the introduction of isolation distances and buffer zones, bees and other pollinating insects have become vectors of 'genetic pollution', disrupting the project of cohabitation and purification devised by European authorities. Drawing on the work of Michel Serres on parasitism, this paper traces the emergence of bees as an object of regulatory scrutiny and as an interruptor of the 'coexistence' project. Along with bees, however, another uninvited guest arrived unexpectedly on the scene: the beekeeper, who came to see his traditional relationship to bees, crops, and consumers at risk.

While outcrossing levels have been described in crops such as rape that are wind-pollinated, or both wind- and insect-pollinated, much less is known about pollen dispersal in exclusively insect-pollinated crops. In this paper, we develop a mechanistic model for pollen movement that is based on a description of bee movement through space. Our model is a system of diffusion-based partial differential equations that we use to predict percent transgenic seed at arbitrary distances from a transgenic source under different planting scenarios. We present a two-pronged study, in which the mathematical modelling work is informed by experimental work. The latter was carried out in an apple orchard with a row of 200 transgenic source trees carrying the GUS marker gene. Fruit from neighbouring conventional trees was gathered at distances ranging from 3.5. m to 183. m, and the seeds were extracted and germinated. Percent transgenic seed at each location was determined by testing the seedlings for the presence of the GUS marker gene. We use the experimental data to validate and parameterize the model, and then run model simulations to determine expected percent transgenic seed in various linear landscapes. We find that the percent transgenic seed in neighbouring conventional trees and orchards is a function of the size of each orchard block and the distance between them. The model explicitly shows the effect of overlapping transgenic and nontransgenic pollen distributions in setting seed distributions, and also shows the value of buffer rows in reducing outcrossing levels in neighbouring crops. The model parameters can be adjusted to suit particular crops and locations, and may be useful for determining plausible distributions on transgenic seed plantings needed to allow for an adventitious presence of, for example, 0.9%. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

Juss. ex Kunth (Bignoniaceae) is a ubiquitous showy plant species that occurs naturally throughout much of the tropics and is commonly used as an ornamental in urban landscapes. The natural distribution and abundance of this floral resource in northwestern Costa Rica presents the opportunity for a comparative study of urban bees across repeated samples and in multiple cities, filling an important data gap in urban bee ecology. Community composition and daily foraging patterns of bees visiting flowering urban T. stans resources were outlined and compared over a 21-month period from July 2007 to March 2009. A total of 27 species were identified as foragers, accounting for over 10% of the known diversity from nearby wildlands. These bees were in the families Apidae and Halictidae and represented diverse feeding and nesting habits, as well as social and solitary life histories. Centris eurypatana Snelling, Ancyloscelis sp. 1, and Nannotriogna perilampoides (Cresson) were the dominant species collected and accounted for nearly 75% of all records. Clear daily phenology was evident, with peak visitation occurring before 1300h. Common visitors can be sorted into early morning or full day foragers represented by Xylocopa and Halictus species, respectively. Community similarity and relative taxon dominance in each city appears to be related to the surrounding peri-urban landscapes, however further study is needed to verify this trend. The potential of T. stans to serve as an in-situ monitoring resource for urban bee communities is discussed as the natural distribution and attractiveness present opportunities across a broad geographic range. © 2011 Kansas Entomological Society.",Article,Scopus

While landscape context and habitat quality are known to influence species richness and abundance of bees, there is a lack of evidence from manipulative field experiments on bees' responses to adaptive management across differently structured landscapes. We present the results of a large-scale study that investigated the effects of a targeted agri-environment scheme (AES) on bumble bees (Bombus spp.) over three years in the United Kingdom. Forage patches of different sizes were sown with a conservation flower mixture across eight sites covering a broad range of agricultural land use types. Species richness and worker densities (especially of the longer-tongued Bombus species for which the mixture was targeted) were significantly higher on sown forage patches than on existing non-crop control habitats throughout the three-year study, but the strength of this response depended on both the proportions of arable land and abundance of herbaceous forb species in the surrounding landscape. The size of sown patches also affected worker density, with smaller patches (0.25 ha) attracting higher densities of some species than larger patches (1.0 ha). Our models show that a targeted AES can deliver greater net benefits in more intensively farmed areas, in terms of the number and species richness of bumble bees supported, than in heterogeneous landscapes where other foraging habitats exist. These findings serve to strengthen the evidence base for extending agri-environment schemes to boost declining pollinator populations to a larger number of agricultural landscapes across the globe. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus

Genotyping identified 1 genet (27 × 13 m) that dominated about 30% of a study site, whereas 15 genets spread a maximum average distance of about 5.5 m (range 1.6 -27.1 m) and appeared to be well integrated with intervening genets. We found unexpectedly high genotype diversity, no evidence of a recent genetic bottleneck, and 5 of 6 patches had mean fixation index values that were near Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium expectations.

If patterns of genetic structure are determined largely by gene flow then they may be useful in predicting the likelihood of inbreeding or outbreeding depression but should be less useful if there is strong site-specific selection. For many Australian plants little is known about either their population genetics or the effects on mating systems of variation in pollen transfer distances. Experimental pollinations were used to compare the reproductive success of bird-adapted Grevillea mucronulata plants mated with individuals from a range of spatial scales. A hierarchical survey of microsatellite DNA variation was also conducted to describe the scale of population differentiation for neutral markers. • Methods: The effects of four pollen treatments on reproductive performance were compared. These treatments were characterized by transfer of pollen from (a) neighbouring adults; (b) an adjacent cluster of adults (30-50 m distant); (c) a distant cluster (&gt;5 km distant); and (d) open pollination. Sets of 17.9 ± 3·3 leaves from each of 15 clusters of plants were genotyped and spatial autocorrelation and F statistics were used to describe patterns of genetic structure. • Key Results: Grevillea mucronulata displayed evidence of both inbreeding and outbreeding depression, with 'intermediate' pollen producing consistently superior outcomes for most aspects of fitness including seed set, seed size, germination and seedling growth. Significant genotypic structuring was detected within clusters (spatial autocorrelation) and among adjacent clusters and clusters separated by &gt;5 km distance (F ST = 0.07 and 0·10). • Conclusions: The superior outcome of intermediate pollen transfer and genetic differentiation of adjacent clusters suggests that G. mucronulata selection disfavours matings among closely and distantly related neighbours. Moreover, the performance of open-pollinated seedlings was poor, implying that current mating patterns are suboptimal. © The Author 2011.

We selected calcareous grasslands in the vicinity of Göttingen (Germany), which harbour high Hymenoptera diversity and are starting points for foraging and dispersal in the landscape. We installed pan traps to sample bees (i) on the grasslands; (ii) on grassland edges behind adjacent hedges (potential barriers) and without hedges; (iii) on grass strips in 100. m distance to the grassland, which were connected or unconnected to the grassland; and (iv) unconnected (isolated) grass strips in 300. m and 750. m distance to test for corridor and isolation effects on abundance and species richness of foraging wild bees.

Species abundance and richness declined with increasing isolation from grasslands for foraging solitary bees, trap-nesting bees, wasps and parasitoids, but not for foraging bumblebees. Hedges did not confine movement of foraging bees. We found no mitigating effects of (100. m) corridor strips on any of the observed groups.

All adult trees (260) within a population of 40 ha and 9 isolated individuals on the edge of the reserve were sampled, and from these adults, 21 open-pollinated progeny arrays were analyzed in 2 flowering seasons (309 seeds in 2004 and 328 in 2005).

The objective of this study was to determine the richness and abundance of native bees in the cranberry-growing area of southern coastal Oregon and compare foraging behaviors of honeybees and native bees. In a 2-year study, we collected over 27 native bee species in traps set out during and after bloom (mid-May to mid-June). During 67 2-min observations, honeybees (68.1%) and three species of bumble bees (Bombus spp.; 31.6%) comprised 99.7% of foragers. The dominant bumble bee was Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski (56.0%). Multivariate regression of temperature and wind speed data indicated that both were significantly predictive of honeybee and bumble bee foragers (P < 0.001). The interquartile range for foraging was 18.3 to 22.2 °C for bumble bees and 21.1 to 26.7°C for honeybees. Over 75% of honeybees were seen foraging above the average observed temperature (19.5°C).

Gardens in human settlements in the desert are often a main source of alien plant species that provide ample foraging resources year round. These changes in floral composition and availability may alter pollinator community composition and foraging behaviour, as well as pollination network characteristics. We investigated the effects of desert gardening on pollinator communities and pollination networks in the Jordan Rift Valley (Israel), an arid agro-natural landscape south of the Dead Sea. We studied seasonal diversity patterns of plants and wild bees in natural habitats and in gardens in settlements. Wild bees and blooming plants were sampled from February to July in 2007 and in 2008. We constructed plant-pollinator networks and compared bee communities between the two habitat types along the season. We found that bee abundance was greater in the gardens, and that rarefied bee species richness was greater in the natural habitat. Bee species richness and abundance exhibited contrasting seasonal patterns between habitats. Bee community composition also differed greatly between habitats, and species in the gardens had a generally wider geographical range in comparison to species in the natural habitat. We also found a higher level of generalisation of the pollination network in the gardens compared to the natural habitat, which may indicate a response to a disturbed and unstable environment. We conclude that gardening in deserts although promoting overall bee abundance, negatively affects species richness and changes community composition and network characteristics, with possible implications on the composition of native flora in the natural habitat surrounding the gardens. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Article,Scopus

The robust Melipona scutellaris (Latreille, 1811) was used as a model and the flight activity and pollen harvest along the day were measured in 12 colonies (4 colonies/habitat), in three types of habitats with varying rainfall, within the natural distribution range of this species (tropical rainforest, seasonal tropical forest and transition of tropical forest-savannah). Most of flight activity occurs during morning time in the three habitats. Colony foraging is high in the very early morning when the relative humidity is also high, and often associated with peaks of ollen harvest. Flight activity decreases abruptly during the high temperatures around noon time. The relationship between the flight activity and the relative humidity was highly significant and linear, in contrast to the unimodal and significant relationship with temperature. The relationship between the flight activity and the relative humidity is assumed to be contingent within humid tropical habitats, considering the daily microclimate variation and pollen foraging patterns.

The concept of reconciliation ecology, by which the anthropogenic environment may be modified to encourage non-human use and biodiversity preservation without compromising societal utilization, potentially represents an appropriate paradigm for urban conservation given the generally poor opportunities that exist for reserve establishment and ecological restoration in urban areas. Two habitat improvement techniques with great potential for reconciliation ecology in urban areas are the installation of living roofs and walls, which have been shown to support a range of taxa at local scales. This paper evaluates the reconciliation potential of living roofs and walls, in particular highlighting both ecological and societal limitations that need to be overcome for application at the landscape scale. We further consider that successful utilization of living roofs and walls for urban reconciliation ecology will rely heavily on the participation of urban citizens, and that a 'citizen science' model is needed to facilitate public participation and support and to create an evidence base to determine their effectiveness.

Some honeybee species engage in visually apparent behavior, walking in a figure-eight pattern inside their dark hives. It has been suggested that sounds play an important role in this dance language, even though a variety of wing vibration sounds are produced by honeybee behaviors in hives. It has been shown that dances emit sounds primarily at about 250-300 Hz, which is in the same frequency range as honeybees' flight sounds. Thus the exact mechanism whereby honeybees attract nestmates using waggle dances in such a dark and noisy hive is as yet unclear. In this study, we used a flight simulator in which honeybees were attached to a torque meter in order to analyze the component of bees' orienting response caused only by sounds, and not by odor or by vibrations sensed by their legs. We showed using single sound localization that honeybees preferred sounds around 265 Hz. Furthermore, according to sound discrimination tests using sounds of the same frequency, honeybees preferred rhythmic sounds. Our results demonstrate that frequency and rhythmic components play a complementary role in localizing dance sounds.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we report the first successful use of micro radio telemetry to track flight distances and space use of bumblebees. Using ground surveys and Cessna overflights in a Central European rural landscape mosaic we obtained maximum flight distances of 2.5 km, 1.9 km and 1.3 km for Bombus terrestris (workers), Bombus ruderatus (worker), and Bombus hortorum (young queens), respectively. Bumblebee individuals used large areas (0.25-43.53 ha) within one or a few days. Habitat analyses of one B. hortorum queen at the landscape scale indicated that gardens within villages were used more often than expected from habitat availability. Detailed movement trajectories of this individual revealed that prominent landscape structures (e.g. trees) and flower patches were repeatedly visited. However, we also observed long (i.e. >45 min) resting periods between flights (B. hortorum) and differences in flower-handling between bumblebees with and without transmitters (B. terrestris) suggesting that the current weight of transmitters (200 mg) may still impose significant energetic costs on the insects. Conclusions/Significance: Spatio-temporal movements of bumblebees can now be tracked with telemetry methods. Our measured flight distances exceed many previous estimates of bumblebee foraging ranges and suggest that travelling long distances to food resources may be common. However, even the smallest currently available transmitters still appear to compromise flower handling performance and cause an increase in resting behavior of bees. Future reductions of transmitter mass and size could open up new avenues for quantifying landscape-scale space use of insect pollinators and could provide novel insights into the behavior and requirements of bumblebees during critical life stages, e.g. when searching for mates, nest locations or hibernation sites. © 2011 Hagen et al.",Article,Scopus

Research has shown that they achieve this feat by memorizing landmarks and the skyline panorama, using the sun and polarized skylight as compasses and by integrating their outbound flight paths. In order to investigate the capacity of the honeybees' homing abilities, we artificially displaced foragers to novel release spots at various distances up to 13 km in the four cardinal directions. Returning bees were individually registered by a radio frequency identification (RFID) system at the hive entrance. We found that homing rate, homing speed and the maximum homing distance depend on the release direction. Bees released in the east were more likely to find their way back home, and returned faster than bees released in any other direction, due to the familiarity of global landmarks seen from the hive. Our findings suggest that such large scale homing is facilitated by global landmarks acting as beacons, and possibly the entire skyline panorama. © 2011 Pahl et al.",Article,Scopus

It has not yet been established, however, which specific parts of the optical flow field insects use to control their speed. With a view to answering this question, freely flying honeybees were trained to fly along a specially designed tunnel including two successive tapering parts: the first part was tapered in the vertical plane and the second one, in the horizontal plane. The honeybees were found to adjust their speed on the basis of the optic flow they perceived not only in the lateral and ventral parts of their visual field, but also in the dorsal part. More specifically, the honeybees' speed varied monotonically, depending on the minimum cross-section of the tunnel, regardless of whether the narrowing occurred in the horizontal or vertical plane. The honeybees' speed decreased or increased whenever the minimum cross-section decreased or increased. In other words, the larger sum of the two opposite optic flows in the horizontal and vertical planes was kept practically constant thanks to the speed control performed by the honeybees upon encountering a narrowing of the tunnel. The previously described ALIS (""AutopiLot using an Insect-based vision System"") model nicely matches the present behavioral findings. The ALIS model is based on a feedback control scheme that explains how honeybees may keep their speed proportional to the minimum local cross-section of a tunnel, based solely on optic flow processing, without any need for speedometers or rangefinders. The present behavioral findings suggest how flying insects may succeed in adjusting their speed in their complex foraging environments, while at the same time adjusting their distance not only from lateral and ventral objects but also from those located in their dorsal visual field. © 2011 Portelli et al.",Article,Scopus

We studied the genetic structure of four natural populations of S. lycocarpum separated by 19 to 128 km, including individuals located along dirt roads that interlink three of the populations.

We previously used a novel immediate early gene, termed kakusei, to demonstrate that the neural activity of a specific mushroom body (MB) neuron subtype is preferentially enhanced in the forager brain. The sensory information related to this MB neuron activity, however, remained unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we used kakusei to analyze the relationship between MB neuron activity and types of foraging behavior. The number of kakusei-positive MB neurons was higher in the round dancers that had flown a short distance than in the waggle dancers that had flown a long distance. Furthermore, the amount of kakusei transcript in the MBs inversely related to the waggle-phase duration of the waggle dance, which correlates with the flight distance. Using a narrow tunnel whose inside was vertically or axially lined, we manipulated the pattern of visual input, which is received by the foragers during flight, and analysed kakusei expression. The amount of kakusei transcript in the MBs was related to the foraging frequency but not to the tunnel pattern. In contrast, the number of kakusei-positive MB neurons was affected by the tunnel patterns, but not related to foraging frequency.

We ask whether bee and fly pollinator taxa differ in their dispersal distances and transport of viable pollen in a human-modified system. Location Canterbury and Otago region, South Island, New Zealand. Methods We captured pollen-carrying insects travelling outside of a model mass-flowering agricultural crop, Brassica rapa, using insect flight intercept traps at five distances (0, 100, 200, 300 and 400m) from the pollen source. We examined pollen loads and pollen viability to determine whether pollen transport distance and viability differ among pollinator taxa. Results A total of 5453 insects were collected of which 717 individuals from 26 insect taxa were positively identified as dispersing pollen up to 400m from the source. These taxa consisted of four species from two bee families (Hymenoptera: Apidae and Halictidae), and eight species from four fly families (Diptera: Bibiondae, Stratiomyidae, Syrphidae and Tachinidae). Apidae generally carried higher pollen loads and more viable pollen than most fly taxa. Taxa in the fly families Stratiomyidae and Syrphidae, however, carried pollen to 400m, which is further than both bee families. Main conclusions A diverse array of wild and managed flower visitors can transport viable pollen from a pollen source to at least 400m. Knowledge of the differences in transport distances among generalist pollinators in human-modified environments is crucial to understand the potential extent to which (1) pollen transport can facilitate gene flow and (2) unwanted hybridization may occur between crops and related weeds. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Movement in the intensive search mode (ISM) is modeled by diffusion, and movement in the extensive search mode (ESM) is modeled by advection.

Honeybees communicate places by encoding distance and direction in their waggle dances [1]. Controversy exists not only about the structure of spatial memory but also about the efficiency of dance communication [2-5]. Some of these uncertainties were resolved by studies in which recruits' flights were monitored using harmonic radar [6, 7]. We asked whether the two sources of vector information - the previously learned flight vector to a food source and the communicated vector - are represented in a common frame of spatial reference. We found that recruits redirect their outbound flights and perform novel shortcut flights between the communicated and learned locations in both directions. Guidance by beacons at the respective locations or by the panorama of the horizon was excluded.

Over a two month period from August to October, the population of bees, brood, and V. destructorin the donor colonies were estimated at three week intervals and the invasion of V. destructorinto the receiver colonies was recorded every 7-12 days.

We determined whether foraging is improved in part because patriline diversity generates more responsive populations of scouting foragers. Scouts search for new food sources and advertise them with waggle dances to inform other foragers about unexploited discoveries. We moved multiple-patriline and single-patriline colonies to unfamiliar locations so that colonies relied heavily on successful scouts to initiate recruitment and then compared the development of foraging effort between the two types of colonies. More waggle dance signals were produced during the incipient stages of foraging in multiple-patriline colonies compared to single-patriline colonies because scouts reported food discoveries with longer dances. Scouts also returned to multiple-patriline colonies at rates that were two thirds higher than those of single-patriline colonies, although return rates for general forager populations were not significantly different between colony types. The distance of reported food sources from hives increased with time for all colonies, but by the end of their first day in an unfamiliar environment, maximal foraging reach was greater if colonies had multiple patrilines. Most scouts in multiple-patriline colonies came from a minority of scout-rich patrilines that were generally not those from which general forager populations were derived; the presence of such scout-rich patrilines was correlated with the extent of recruitment signaling in colonies.

In particular, the size of visitors, relative to flower size, may have severe implications for plant fitness, as it can affect the mechanics of the pollination process. Ononis masquillierii, a rare endemic legume in northern Italy, is visited by numerous bee species of different families and sizes. To evaluate the effect of bee guilds on seed set, we compared the relative efficiency of four size classes of bees visiting flowers in eight plant populations occurring in the Apennines. Size classes were assorted by body weight. Reproductive success was positively related to plant population size and affected by the visitation frequency of the bee size guilds: higher visitation rates by larger bees (medium-large Andrenidae and large Apidae) increased seed set, whereas high visitation rates by smaller bees (small Halictidae and small-medium Megachilidae) reduced seed set. We conclude that the influence of bee size on seed set is related to the pollen foraging techniques of the different bee guilds. Larger bees paying short visits to flowers remove one 'batch' of pollen and transfer it to another flower. In contrast, smaller bees enter the flower entirely and activate the pump-like pollen dispensing mechanism several times, resulting in a higher degree of selfing. These behaviours may result in differential seed sets as the flowers are self-incompatible, i.e. seed set may be reduced after visitation by smaller bees. Such variations in pollinator quality among populations coupled with the ephemeral nature of the habitat of O. masquillierii may represent a risk for its persistence. Our results show that such a risk can be confronted only through the conservation of large plant populations and of large bees capable of flying long-distances. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.",Article,Scopus

For example, it is widely accepted that desert ants and honey bees, but also mammals, use path integration for finding the way back to their home site. It is however a matter of a long standing debate whether animals in addition are able to acquire and use so called cognitive maps. Such a 'map', a global spatial representation of the foraging area, is generally assumed to allow the animal to find shortcuts between two sites although the direct connection has never been travelled before. Using the artificial neural network approach, here we develop an artificial memory system which is based on path integration and various landmark guidance mechanisms (a bank of individual and independent landmark-defined memory elements). Activation of the individual memory elements depends on a separate motivation network and an, in part, asymmetrical lateral inhibition network. The information concerning the absolute position of the agent is present, but resides in a separate memory that can only be used by the path integration subsystem to control the behaviour, but cannot be used for computational purposes with other memory elements of the system. Thus, in this simulation there is no neural basis of a cognitive map. Nevertheless, an agent controlled by this network is able to accomplish various navigational tasks known from ants and bees and often discussed as being dependent on a cognitive map. For example, map-like behaviour as observed in honey bees arises as an emergent property from a decentralized system. This behaviour thus can be explained without referring to the assumption that a cognitive map, a coherent representation of foraging space, must exist. We hypothesize that the proposed network essentially resides in the mushroom bodies of the insect brain. © 2011 Cruse, Wehner.",Article,Scopus

However, while numerous recent studies have investigated individual-level personality, the phenomenon of collective personality in animal groups has received little attention. In this paper, we apply the concept of collective personality to colonies of honeybees (Apis mellifera). We document the presence of consistent differences among colonies across a wide range of collective behaviours and demonstrate a link between colony-level personality traits and fitness. The colonies in our study showed consistent behavioural differences in traits such as defensive response, foraging activity and undertaking, and several of these traits were correlated as part of a behavioural syndrome. Furthermore, some of these traits were strongly tied to colony productivity and winter survival. Our results show that the concept of collective personality is applicable to colonies of social insects, and that personality differences among colonies can have important consequences for their long-term survival and reproduction. Applying the concept of personality to close-knit animal groups can provide important insights into the structure of behavioural variability in animal populations and the role that consistent between-group behavioural differences play in the evolution of behaviour. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Article,Scopus

Honey bees are a classic example and maintain their thoracic muscles at temperatures (Tth) tuned to the caloric benefits of floral resources. Using infrared thermography, we tested the hypothesis that forager motivation to recruit nestmates for a food source is positively correlated with Tth. We trained bees to a sucrose feeder located 5-100?m from the nest. Recruiting foragers had a significantly higher average Tth (2.7°C higher) when returning from 2.5?mol?l-1 sucrose (65% w/w) than when returning from 1.0?mol?l-1 sucrose (31% w/w). Foragers exhibited significantly larger thermal fluctuations the longer they spent inside the nest between foraging trips.

Bees and wasps were caught with a sweep net during sampling units of 15 min, continuing until four consecutive samples revealed no new species. Total species richness was quantified by the estimators Chao 2, first-order jackknife and Michaelis-Menten. The software binmatnest was used to test for nestedness of species assemblages. Similarities of species composition between islands were quantified by Sørensen's similarity index.Results Eighty-two species were recorded on the 20 surveyed islands. Species richness declined with increasing isolation of islands from the source area, Java. Although the size of the largest island exceeded that of the smallest island by a factor of almost 60, island size only very weakly affected species richness of bees; no effect of island size was found for wasps. Mean body size of species decreased with increasing island isolation. Nestedness of island faunas was only weakly developed. Species composition of both superfamilies was affected by island isolation, but not by island size.Main conclusions While the species-isolation relationship on the very small islands of Kepulauan Seribu followed the prediction of MacArthur and Wilson's equilibrium theory, the absence of a species-area relationship indicated a weak 'small-island effect', at least in wasps. The combination of an only weakly developed pattern of nested species subsets, the shift in species compositions and the decline of mean body size with increasing island isolation from the source area indicates that biotic interactions and different species traits contribute to the shaping of communities of bees and wasps within the archipelago. The potential of biotic interactions for generating distribution patterns of species within the archipelago is also emphasized by the observed restriction of some species with apparently high dispersal abilities to outer islands. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Serving a mobile user automatically by sensing his/her locations in an indoor environment is considered as a challenge. However, indoor localization cannot be carried out effectively using the Global Positioning System (GPS). In recent years, the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in locating a mobile object in an indoor environment has become popular. Some physical features have also been discussed to solve localization in WSNs. In this paper, we inquire into received signal strength indication (RSSI)-based solutions and propose a new localization scheme called the closer tracking algorithm (CTA) for indoor localization. Under the proposed CTA, a mechanism on mode-change is designed to switch automatically between the optimal approximately closer approach (ACA) and the real-time tracking (RTT) method according to pre-tuned thresholds. Furthermore, we design a mechanism to move reference nodes dynamically to reduce the uncovered area of the ACA for increasing the estimation accuracy. We evaluate the proposed CTA using ZigBee CC2431 modules. The experimental results show that the proposed CTA can determine the position accurately with an error distance less than 0.9 m. At the same time, the CTA scheme has at least 87% precision when the distance is less than 0.9 m. The proposed CTA can select an adaptive mode properly to improve the localization accuracy with high confidence. Moreover, the experimental results also show that the accuracy can be improved by the deployment and movement of reference nodes. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Conference Paper,Scopus

This may influence colony performance via effects on worker behaviour. The effects of experimental wing damage were studied in worker honeybees in observation hives by recording survivorship, how often and for how long bees foraged, and by decoding waggle dances. Mortality rate increased with both age and wing damage. Damaged bees carried out shorter and/or less frequent foraging trips, foraged closer to the hive, and reported the profitability of flower patches to be lower than did controls. These results suggest that wing damage caused a reduction in foraging ability, and that damaged bees adjusted their foraging behaviour accordingly. Furthermore, the results suggest that wing damage affects the profitability of nectar sources. These results have implications for the colony dynamics and foraging efficiency in honeybees.

The highly complex social organization of honeybees is mediated through pheromones. Releaser pheromones cause rapid changes in the behaviour of the recipient, while primer pheromones have relatively slow and long-term effects on the physiology and behaviour of the recipient. Queen retinue pheromone (QRP) is a blend of the nine compounds (9-oxo-(E)-2-decenoic acid, (R)- and (S)-9-hydroxy-(E)-2-decenoic acid, methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, 4-hydroxy-3-methyoxyphenylethanol, methyl oleate, coniferyl alcohol, palmityl alcohol, and linolenic acid) and acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting worker bees to the queen. QRP also acts as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting the ovary development of worker bees. An essential component of QRP, 9-oxo-(E)-2-decenoic acid, acts as a long-distance sex pheromone. Defensive behaviour of honeybees is induced and modulated by alarm pheromones. The essential alarm pheromone component is isopentyl acetate (IPA). The unsaturated derivative of IPA, 3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl acetate, was found in colonies of Africanized honeybees. The Nasanov gland of worker bees produces a pheromone (a blend of nerol, geraniol, (E)- and (Z)-citral, nerolic acid, geranic acid and (E, E)-farnesol) that acts as an attracting signal. This pheromone is used for aggregation (during swarming). Adult worker bees also produce a substance, ethyl oleate, that has a priming effect. Ethyl oleate is produced by adult forager bees and acts as a chemical inhibitory factor to delay age at onset of foraging (the presence of older worker bees causes a delayed onset of foraging in younger individuals). Chemical cues on the surface of larvae called a brood pheromone (ethyl and methyl esters of palmitic, linoleic, linolenic, stearic, and oleic acids, E-β-ocimene) are important in the communication between brood and worker bees. This pheromone modulates the feeding behaviour of worker bees, inhibits the activation of the worker ovary, induces worker bees to cap brood cells, increases the activity of the hypopharyngeal glands of nurse bees and modulates the behavioural maturation of worker bees. © 2012 Veterinarni Medicina.",Review,Scopus

Interest in pollen-borne gene dispersal has grown with the cultivation of genetically modified plants. To date, both experimental data and models of oilseed rape (OSR) Brassica napus pollen movement at the landscape scale do not clearly differentiate between wind- and insect-mediated dispersal. Estimations of insect-mediated gene dispersal would be valuable for managing potential escapes of transgenes. 2. To quantify the intensity and spatial scale of pollen dispersal by insect pollinators in an agricultural landscape, bait points made of flowering male-sterile OSR that attract OSR pollinators were located at six distances (10-1100m) from the closest OSR fields and feral populations. Flower-visiting insects were caught by net on these male-sterile flowers and were rubbed onto the stigmas of male-sterile OSR plants grown in a pollen-proof greenhouse to do a manual pollination of their flowers. In this way we were able to assess the insects' OSR pollen load and seed production at each of the six distances. 3. A large diversity of insects carried OSR pollen and contributed to seed production, but not pollen beetles Meligethes aeneus. Logistic regression analyses of the seed-set success from the manual pollination demonstrated that seed set significantly increased with the proximity of OSR fields, the size of the pollinating insect, and the main daily temperature. Seed set was not affected by the pollinating insect's order or genus. Seed set, both observed and predicted by the model, was above zero for flowers pollinated with large bees caught at >1100m from the nearest OSR field. 4. Synthesis and applications.Our study provides clear evidence that a large variety of insect species can transfer viable pollen between OSR plants over considerable distances. However, only 39·4% of the insects caught on male-sterile flowers carried OSR pollen. Our results provide valuable data to improve models of pollen dispersal for entomophilous crops at the landscape scale. These models are essential to help land-managers reduce pollen-borne gene dispersal from genetically modified plants to wild and cultivated relatives. © 2010 British Ecological Society.",Article,Scopus

Here, we identify population genetic divergence in three species of Penstemon (Plantaginaceae) similarly distributed throughout the Great Basin region of the western United States but with different pollination syndromes (bee and hummingbird). The Great Basin ' s mountainous landscape provides an ideal setting to compare the interaction of landscape and dispersal ability in isolating populations of different species. Methods: We used eight highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to identify neutral population genetic structure between populations within and among mountain ranges for eight populations of P. deustus, 10 populations of P. pachyphyllus, and 10 populations of P. rostriflorus. We applied traditional population genetics approaches as well as spatial and landscape genetics approaches to infer genetic structure and discontinuities among populations. Key results: A ll three species had significant genetic structure and exhibited isolation by distance, ranging from high structure and low inferred gene flow in the bee-pollinated species P. deustus (F ST = 0.1330, R ST= 0.4076, seven genetic clusters identify ed) and P. pachyphyllus (F ST= 0.1896, R ST= 0.2531, four genetic clusters identified) to much lower structure and higher inferred gene flow in the hummingbird-pollinated P. rostriflorus (F ST= 0.0638, R ST= 0.1116, three genetic clusters identify ed).

Vertebrates are much less diverse, but dominate some key ecological roles. Almost all plants in tropical lowland forests are pollinated by animals, with bees, followed by beetles and flies, most important. Most seeds are also dispersed by animals, except in the upper canopy, with birds, fruit bats, primates, and a variety of terrestrial mammals most important. Maximum routine movement distances for both pollen and seeds are most often in the range 100–1000 m. Seeds are predated before dispersal by colobine monkeys, squirrels, birds, and insects and after dispersal by rodents, birds, ants, and other insects. After germination, the dominant herbivores are insects, and insects also dominate the consumption of dead plant material. Carnivorous animals have indirect impacts on plants through their effects on the abundances and behaviors of other animals. Few forest animals survive deforestation, while hunting is the major threat to vertebrates in intact and logged forests. Failures of seed dispersal are currently the most obvious impacts of animal losses, but more subtle impacts would be easily overlooked. Restoration of seed dispersal services is potentially one of the most effective ways of enhancing forest recovery after logging and increasing resilience to climate change. © 2011, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Book Chapter,Scopus

Many economic valuation studies on pollination have been conducted without considering the ecology of the system: the reliance of the pollinators on off-farm habitat for floral resources or nesting and overwintering sites or the pollinators' foraging range.

Flower visitation frequency and foraging behavior differed between queen bumblebees and workers. Queens exhibited less frequent flower visits, longer flight distances between inflorescences, and a smaller number of sequential inflorescence visits within patches than did worker bees. Flowering in early-snowmelt populations occurred in June, when only overwintered queens were available, while flowering in late-snowmelt populations occurred from late July to August, when frequent visits by workers were common. The fruit to flower ratio per inflorescence was lower in early-snowmelt populations due to quantitative pollen limitation, while the seed to ovule ratio per fruit was lower in late-snowmelt populations. This is because geitonogamous pollination by workers was common later in the season, which resulted in a high abortion rate of self-pollinated seeds, that is, qualitative pollen limitation. Thus, pollination efficiency, or the type of pollen limitation, shifts during the flowering season, reflecting the seasonal life cycle of bumblebees in the ecosystem. Many of the self-fertilized seeds aborted due to high inbreeding depression, and the outcrossing rate was ;80% regardless of season. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

These effects on pollination may depend on how pollinators respond to floral resources at multiple levels. In this study, we demonstrate pollinatormediated negative interactions between two invasive plants, Carduus acanthoides and Carduus nutans. Using constructed arrays of the two species, alone and in mixture, we quantified pollinator visitation at the patch and individual plant levels and measured seed production. We found that co-occurrence of our species led to a shift in pollinator services at both levels. Greater interference occurred when arrays were small and spacings between neighboring plants were large. Aspatially explicit movement model suggests that pollinator foraging behavior, which mediates the interactions between plants, was driven by floral display size rather than species identity per se. Pollinator behavior significantly reduced the proportion of seed set for both species relative to that in single-species arrays. Overall, the dependence of pollinator behavior on patch size, spacing between plants, and patch composition can lead to pollinator-mediated plant interactions that range from facilitative to competitive. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.",Article,Scopus

Here we report the results of an environmental analysis based on extensive censuses of abundance of nine animal taxa (spiders, dragonflies, grasshoppers, bumblebees, butterflies, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) around Chernobyl in Ukraine and Belarus during 2006-2009. Background levels of radiation explained 1.5-26.5% of the variance in abundance of these nine taxa, birds and mammals having the strongest effects, accounting for a difference of a factor 18 among taxa. These effects were retained in analyses that accounted for potentially confounding effects. Effect size estimated as the amount of variance in abundance explained by background level of radiation was highly consistent among years, with weaker effects in years with low density. Effect sizes were greaterin taxa with longer natal dispersal distances and in taxa with higher population density. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that costs of dispersal (i.e. survival) were accentuated under conditions of radioactive contamination, or that high density allowed detection of radiation effects.

We studied the viral distribution in honey bees, in their pollen loads, and in other non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators collected from flowering plants in Pennsylvania, New York, and Illinois in the United States. Viruses in the samples were detected using reverse transcriptase-PCR and confirmed by sequencing. For the first time, we report the molecular detection of picorna-like RNA viruses (deformed wing virus, sacbrood virus and black queen cell virus) in pollen pellets collected directly from forager bees. Pollen pellets from several uninfected forager bees were detected with virus, indicating that pollen itself may harbor viruses. The viruses in the pollen and honey stored in the hive were demonstrated to be infective, with the queen becoming infected and laying infected eggs after these virus- ontaminated foods were given to virus-free colonies. These viruses were detected in eleven other non-Apis hymenopteran species, ranging from many solitary bees to bumble bees and wasps. This finding further expands the viral host range and implies a possible deeper impact on the health of our ecosystem. Phylogenetic analyses support that these viruses are disseminating freely among the pollinators via the flower pollen itself. Notably, in cases where honey bee apiaries affected by CCD harbored honey bees with Israeli Acute Paralysis virus (IAPV), nearby non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators also had IAPV, while those near apiaries without IAPV did not. In containment greenhouse experiments, IAPV moved from infected honey bees to bumble bees and from infected bumble bees to honey bees within a week, demonstrating that the viruses could be transmitted from one species to another. This study adds to our present understanding of virus epidemiology and may help explain bee disease patterns and pollinator population decline in general. © 2010 Singh et al.",Article,Scopus

Despite the widespread nature of this strategy, we still know little about how spatial memory develops and guides individuals toward suitable routes. Here, we investigate whether flower visitation sequences by bumblebees Bombus terrestris simply reflect the order in which flowers were discovered or whether they result from more complex navigational strategies enabling bees to optimize their foraging routes. We analyzed bee flight movements in an array of four artificial flowers maximizing interfloral distances. Starting from a single patch, we sequentially added three new patches so that if bees visited them in the order in which they originally encountered flowers, they would follow a long (suboptimal) route. Bees' tendency to visit patches in their discovery order decreased with experience. Instead, they optimized their flight distances by rearranging flower visitation sequences. This resulted in the development of a primary route (trapline) and two or three less frequently used secondary routes. Bees consistently used these routes after overnight breaks while occasionally exploring novel possibilities. We discuss how maintaining some level of route flexibility could allow traplining animals to cope with dynamic routing problems, analogous to the well-known traveling salesman problem. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.",Article,Scopus

The study was conducted in 14 stationary apiaries situated in southeastern Opole Province (Poland) in autumn 2007 and in spring, summer and autumn 2008. Samples were mineralized using microwave method. Quantitative analysis of studied metals in bees' bodies and multiflower honey were done using the plasma spectrometry method (ICP). It was found that copper was an element present in bodies of worker bees in the highest concentration. Its mean content was 22.6 mg·kg -1 d.m. Next was selenium - 7.03, lead - 1.95 and cadmium - 0.65 mg·kg -1 d.m. The highest level of Cu, Pb and Cd accumulation (means on a level of 24.5, 2.59 and 0.83 mg·kg -1 d.m., respectively) was observed in samples of bees obtained during spring 2008, and of selenium in autumn 2008. The lowest concentration of Pb and Cd (means on a level of 0.95 and 0.46 mg·kg -1 d.m., respectively) were in turn observed in autumn 2008, Cu (20.6 mg·kg -1 d.m.) in autumn 2007, and Se (5.81 mg·kg -1 d.m.) in spring 2008. In most cases, the differences in contents of particular metals between periods of sample collection were significant (p≤0.05) or highly significant (p≤0.01) statistically. Higher concentrations of copper (23.3 in comparison to 22.0 mg·kg -1 d.m.), selenium (7.58 in comparison to 6.48 mg·kg -1 d.m.), and lead (1.98 in comparison to 1.91 mg·kg -1 d.m.) were demonstrated in bees from urbanized regions, while cadmium (0.70 in comparison to 0.60 mg·kg -1 d.m.) in those from agricultural-woodland. The sequence of the range of analyzed metals accumulation in honey was the same as in the case of bees, but concentrations were manyfold lower: Cu - 0.82, Se - 0.38, Pb - 0.06 and Cd - 0.06 mg·kg -1 d.m).

Solar heat is a gain in the cold but may be a burden in the heat. We investigated the balancing of endothermic activity with radiative heat gain and physiological functions of water foraging Apis mellifera carnica honeybees in the whole range of ambient temperatures (Ta) and solar radiation they are likely to be exposed in their natural environment in Middle Europe.The mean thorax temperature (Tth) during foraging stays was regulated at a constantly high level (37.0-38.5°C) in a broad range of Ta (3-30°C). At warmer conditions (Ta=30-39°C) Tth increased to a maximal level of 45.3°C. The endothermic temperature excess (difference of Tbody-Ta of living and dead bees) was used to assess the endogenously generated temperature elevation as a correlate of energy turnover. Up to a Ta of ∼30°C bees used solar heat gain for a double purpose: to reduce energetic expenditure and to increase Tth by about 1-3°C to improve force production of flight muscles. At higher Ta they exhibited cooling efforts to get rid of excess heat. A high Tth also allowed regulation of the head temperature high enough to guarantee proper function of the bees' suction pump even at low Ta. This shortened the foraging stays and this way reduced energetic costs. With decreasing Ta bees also reduced arrival body weight and crop loading to do both minimize costs and optimize flight performance. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus

The objective of the present work was to verify the guild structure of bees that visit this plant, studying the richness and abundance of species and foraging patterns. The floral visitors were accompanied in 2005 and 2006, during the flowering period, from October to December, in three areas of the cerrado with different sizes and with lower or higher natural vegetation covering. Bees were collected fortnightly, with entomological net, by two collectors. Six samples were carried out in 2005 during 8 hours a day, and five samples were carried out in 2006 during 4 hours a day. In the first stage 1,516 bees from 80 species were sampled, with the dominance of 24 species (30%). In the second stage 562 individuals from 66 species were sampled, with the dominance of 10 species (15%). Bees were from five Apoidea families, in a total of 105 species and 2078 individuals. Apidae was the most common family both in number of species and number of individuals. The predominance of Apidae in relation to the number of individuals occurred mainly due to two eusocial species, Apis mellifera and Scaptotrigona depilis. Other abundant species were Rophitulus sp., Tetragonisca angustula and Scaptotrigona polysticta. Apis mellifera was predominant on the three sampled areas. The most abundant bee species presented non- coincidental activity peaks, but there was not a foraging pattern of resource division. The pattern found on the guild structure of bees which visit Matayba guianensis was in accordance with the general pattern related to the dominance of Apidae on the Cerrado environment. In relation to species distribution, there was a small number of species with great abundance of individuals, and a great number of rare species with few individuals.",Article,Scopus

Our results show that for locating stationary targets, the Levy length for a search leg is strongly correlated with the distance of the target from the location where the search starts. For locating and tracking mobile targets, we find that the search performance improves as the p.d.f. of the Levy distribution is made flatter.

Termites are notoriously cryptic: infestations in houses are often discovered when an apparently intact timber object collapses, the archetypal 'falling through the floor boards'. Remaining undiscovered is the termite's primary defence against predators such as ants. However, being cryptic severely limits the ability of termites to explore their environment and assess potential food sources. Despite being blind and hidden, termites can assess a piece of wood swiftly after contacting only a small part of it (sometimes as little as a few square millimetres). Such ability has been a mystery. Unlike bees and ants, which have been found to use a range of visual, chemical and vibrational cues for communication, how information is collected and transmitted between termites is poorly known. In addition, the use of chemical communication by termites has been shown to be very limited compared to other social insects. While previous research showed that termite soldiers produce vibratory alarm signals to warn conspecific workers, the role of vibrations in termite foraging behaviour remains largely unexplored. Recent results are presented to demonstrate the ability of termites to detect vibration signals and to use the information contained in these signals to assess the quantity and quality of food and to eavesdrop to avoid competitors.",Conference Paper,Scopus

We have little idea how landscape-scale factors influence the success of wild bumblebee nests over time. Here for the first time we use molecular markers to estimate within-season changes in the numbers of nests. 2. Workers of two bumblebee species were sampled in an arable landscape in late May-June and late July-August, and the numbers of nests represented in each sample were estimated. We compare the methods available to estimate nest number from such samples and conclude that methods which allow for heterogeneity in the probability of capture of nests provide the best fit to our data. Changes in numbers of nests at the two time points were used to infer nest survival. 3. The two bee species appeared to differ markedly in survival over time, with estimates of 45% of nests surviving for Bombus lapidarius and 91% for B. pascuorum. However, our data suggest that the foraging range of B. pascuorum may be greater in late season, which would lead us to overestimate nest survival in this species. Differential survival may also reflect differences in phenology between the two species. 4. The land use class which had the most consistent effects on nest number and survival was gardens; for B. lapidarius, the area of gardens within a 750 and 1000 m radius positively influenced nest survival, while for B. pascuorum, the number of nests in late samples was higher at sites with more gardens within a 500 and 750-m radius. For B. pascuorum, the area of grassland within a 250 and 500-m radius also positively influenced nest number in late samples, probably because this is the preferred nesting habitat for this species. 5. The importance of gardens is in accordance with previous studies which suggest that they now provide a stronghold for bumblebees in an otherwise impoverished agricultural environment; furthermore, our data suggest that the positive influence of gardens on bumblebee populations can spill over at least 1 km into surrounding farmland. 6. Synthesis and applications. The substantial effects that even small areas of local resources such as rough grassland or clover leys can have on bumblebee nest numbers and survival is of clear relevance for the design of pollinator management strategies. © 2010 The Authors.

Two of these, Bombus terrestris and B. hortorum, are common in Europe whilst two, B. ruderatus and B. subterraneus, have experienced declines, and the latter is now extinct in the UK. The presence of these species in New Zealand presents an opportunity to study their ecology in a contrasting environment. Forage visits made by bumblebees in New Zealand were recorded across a season. Ninety-six percent of visits were to six non-native forage plants (Cirsium vulgare, Echium vulgare, Hypericum perforatum, Lotus corniculatus, Lupinus polyphyllus and Trifolium pratense). All but L. polyphyllus are European plant species, and three are noxious weeds in New Zealand. Several of these plants have decreased in abundance in the UK, providing a potential explanation for the declines of B. ruderatus and B. subterraneus in Britain. In contrast to studies conducted elsewhere, B. ruderatus, B. terrestris and B. hortorum did not differ in diet breadth and overlap in forage use was high, probably due to the reduced diversity of bumblebee forage plants present in New Zealand. Diel partitioning of forage use between the species was observed, with foraging activity of B. hortorum greatest in the morning and evening, B. ruderatus greatest in the middle of the day and B. terrestris intermediate between the two. These patterns correspond to the climatic preferences of each species as evidenced by their geographic ranges.

The wild pollinators need both fitting nesting sites and enough pollen and nectar resources. The evaluation model was based on different types of land use/cover. It used the availability of nesting sites and pollen and nectar resources which have important effect on wild pollinators' habitat and simulate its suitability of distribution (habitat quality index). It used the focal analysis method to simulate the potential quantity index of pollinator which flied to specific crops (the ability of pollination service) by integrating the max distance that wild pollinators travel to forage on flowers and the distribution of crops which need pollination. Taking the native wild Apis cerana Fabricius in Laojunshan Yunnan Province as an example, the simulated results of this model showed that the average habitat quality index of wild Apis cerana Fabricius in forest was the highest (2. 24 × 10 -2) because most wild Apis cerana Fabricius nested in tree cavities or earth cavities in forest of sunlit side and forest with abundant pollen and nectar resources. On the contrary, the average habitat quality index of wild Apis cerana Fabricius in cultivated vegetation area was the lowest (0. 37 × 10 -2) because the cultivated vegetation area had high intensity of human disturbance thus the natural environment and living condition were relatively poor. In the western study area, the farming region was scattered distribution which all located in Laojunshan National Nature Reserve thus pesticide and chemical fertilizer was rarely applied. It had abundant pollen and nectar resources and nesting sites supplied by the surrounding natural forest. The study area in eastern has lower relief on landform and larger population. The farming region was concentrated distribution and the vegetation type was single and surrounded by the secondary forest that had larger spatial obstacles of pollination. Therefore, from the holistic point of view, the spatial distribution pattern of ecosystem service ability was higher in the western area than in the eastern. In order to increase the farming region's pollination ability in the eastern area, improving the plant diversity on ridges of crop land was suggested. The concrete measures were planting considerable amount of herbaceous plants and (or) retaining a specific number of forest or wild weeds coexisted with crops. On the other hand, it should attach the importance to protection of natural vegetation surrounding the crop land in eastern, especially the natural forest resource.",Article,Scopus

Genetic studies provide insights into population structure that are crucial for conservation management but that would be impossible to obtain by conventional ecological methods. Yet conservation genetic studies of bees have primarily focussed on social species rather than the more species-rich solitary bees. Here, we investigate the population structure of Colletes floralis, a rare and threatened solitary mining bee, in Ireland and Scotland using nine microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was surprisingly as high in Scottish (Hebridean island) populations at the extreme northwestern edge of the species range as in mainland Irish populations further south. Extremely high genetic differentiation among populations was detected; multilocus FST was up to 0.53, and and Dest were even higher (maximum: 0.85 and 1.00, respectively). A pattern of isolation by distance was evident for sites separated by land. Water appears to act as a substantial barrier to gene flow yet sites separated by sea did not exhibit isolation by distance. C.floralis populations are extremely isolated and probably not in regional migration-drift equilibrium. GIS-based landscape genetic analysis reveals urban areas as a potential and substantial barrier to gene flow.

Here, we use molecular genetic methods in an ecological context to demonstrate that endemic Hawaiian Hylaeus bees (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) selectively collect pollen from native plant species in Haleakala and Hawaii Volcanoes National Parks. We identified pollen DNA from the crops (internal storage organs) of 21 Hylaeus specimens stored in ethanol for up to 3 years. Genetic analyses reveal high fidelity in pollen foraging despite the availability of pollen from multiple plant species present at each study site. At high elevations in Haleakala, pollen was available from more than 12 species of flowering plants, but Hawaiian silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp. macrocephalum) comprised 86% of all pollen samples removed from bee crops. At lower elevations in both parks, we only detected pukiawe (Leptecophylla (Styphelia) tameiameiae) pollen in Hylaeus crops despite the presence of other plant species in flower during our study. Furthermore, 100% of Hylaeus crops from which we successfully identified pollen contained native plant pollen. The molecular approaches developed in this study provide species-level information about floral visitation of Hawaiian Hylaeus that does not require specialized palynological expertise needed for high-throughput visual pollen identification. Building upon this approach, future studies can thus develop appropriate and customized criteria for assessing mixed pollen loads from a broader range of sources and from other global regions. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Article,Scopus

However, the success of microbiological control agents (MCAs) largely depends on efficient dissemination into the crop. The pollinator-and-vector technology employs pollinating insects like bees for a better dissemination. In this study, a new dispenser for bumblebee workers of Bombus terrestris L. was developed. Binab-T-vector and Prestop-Mix were used as two typical MCA products for dissemination.RESULTS: In a first series of experiments in the laboratory for optimisation, the newly developed dispenser was a two-way type dispenser, 20 cm long, with two rectangular compartments and different entrance and exit holes. In addition, the amounts of MCA loaded on the workers were 10 times higher with the new dispenser as compared with the side-by-side passageway (SSP) dispenser. Typically, the highest amounts were recovered from the thorax and legs of the workers. In a second series of experiments under greenhouse conditions with the use of queen-right B. terrestris hives, successful dissemination in strawberry flowers was obtained at different distances from the hive (0-8 m, 8-18 m and 18-21 m), and the workers inoculated the first, second and third flowers that were consecutively visited. In addition, the new dispenser caused no adverse effects on worker foraging intensity, whereas a dramatic reduction was scored with an SSP dispenser. Finally, the data suggested that it is necessary to refill the newly developed dispenser at 3 day intervals.CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that, with the use of the newly developed dispenser, bumblebee workers carried high amounts of MCA, and this resulted in a successful dissemination of MCA into strawberry flowers. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.",Article,Scopus

Bees carrying pollen and/or nectar were captured at nest entrances during 5 min every hour, from sunrise to sunset, once a month. Pollen loads were counted and saved for acetolysis. Nectar was collected, the volume was determined and the total dissolved solids were determined by refractometer. Air temperature, relative humidity and light intensity were also registered. The number of pollen loads reached its maximum value between 70% and 90% of relative humidity and 18 °C and 23°C; for nectar loads this range was broader, 50-90% and 20-30°C. The number of pollen loads increased as relative humidity rose (rs = 0.401; P < 0.01) and high temperatures had a strong negative influence on the number of pollen loads collected (rs = -0.228; P < 0.01). The number of nectar loads positively correlated with temperature (rs = 0.244; P < 0.01) and light intensity (rs = 0.414; P < 0.01). The percentage of total dissolved solids (TDS) on nectar loads positively correlated with temperature and light intensity (rs = 0.361; P < 0.01 and rs = 0.245; P < 0.01), negatively correlated with relative humidity (rs = -0.629; P < 0.01), and it increased along the day. Most nectar loads had TDS between 11% and 30%, with an average of 24.7%. The volume measures did not show any pattern.

This raises the question of the risk of dissemination of genetically modified (GM) pollen to non-GM crops by visiting insects. We inventoried the flower-visiting insects in Bt and non-Bt cotton fields of the South African Highveld region and investigated their role in pollen dispersal. Their diversity and abundance varied slightly among sites, with Astylus atromaculatus as the predominant insect on both Bt and non-Bt cotton flowers. The other major flower-visiting species were Apis mellifera and solitary Apidae. No differences were found in the abundance of each taxum between Bt and non-Bt cotton except for Scoliidae and Nitidulidae, which were scarce overall (<0.5%) but more abundant on the non-Bt flowers in the central area of the field at one site. The pollen load on A. atromaculatus was as high as on Apis mellifera. Cage tests showed that A. atromaculatus can pollinate female cotton plants by transferring pollen from male donor plants. In the field, the flight range of this insect was generally short (25 m), but it can occasionally reach up to 200 m or even more. This study therefore highlights that A. atromaculatus, commonly regarded as a pest, could be an unexpected but efficient pollinator. Because its population density can be high, this species could mediate unwanted cotton pollen flow when distances between coexiting fields are not sufficient. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.",Article,Scopus

We approach this problem through a study of image matching, a navigational strategy in which insects reach a familiar place by moving so that their current retinal image transforms to match a memorized snapshot of the scene viewed from that place. Analysis of how navigating wood ants correct their course when close to a goal reveals a significant part of the mechanism underlying this transformation. Ants followed a short route to an inconspicuous feeder positioned at a fixed distance from a vertical luminance edge. They responded to an unexpected jump of the edge by turning to face the new feeder position specified by the edge. Importantly, the initial speed of the turn increased linearly with the turn's amplitude. This correlation implies that the ants' turns are driven initially by their prior calculation of the angular difference between the current retinal position of the edge and its desired position in their memorized view. Similar turns keep ants to their path during unperturbed routes. The neural circuitry mediating image-matching is thus concerned not only with the storage of views, but also with making exact comparisons between the retinal positions of a visual feature in a memorized view and of the same feature in the current retinal image.",Article,Scopus

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Spiranthes spiralis (L.) Chevall. that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Spiranthes spiralis is a long-lived orchid species that is widely distributed in the southern part of the British Isles, southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is native to Britain. Its most characteristic habitats are unimproved, well-grazed grasslands on dry calcareous soils, particularly chalk and limestone, cliff-tops and grassy coastal dunes. It can also be found in garden lawns and, less frequently, in slightly acidic heathland habitat. It occurs on both dry and wet soils, but it does not tolerate heavy shading. 3. Spiranthes spiralis is a non-bulbous geophyte regenerating by sexual reproduction and by vegetative spread, although the latter is limited. Vegetative reproduction involves the growth of a lateral bud on the underground stem. The new plant forms its own tubers, and eventually the connection between the mother plant and the vegetatively produced daughter plant withers away. 4. The main perennating organ is a tuberous root. In most years, the tuber generates a rosette of expanded leaves, and at the end of every year of the plant's life, the tuber is completely replaced. In some cases, however, only part of the reserves is exhausted in flowering and, when this happens, a tuber may survive for several years. Vegetative adult dormancy - the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a growing season, followed by reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic plants in subsequent seasons - has been observed. It most commonly lasts for only 1 year, but sometimes plants can remain dormant for several years. 5. The species is not autogamous and pollinators - mainly bumblebees and bees - are necessary for successful pollination and fruit set. Natural levels of fruit set are usually <50%. Hand-pollination increases fruit set to c. 75%, indicating that reproduction is to some extent pollen-limited. Sexual reproduction comes at a cost, and few individuals flower for two or more consecutive years. Within fruits many very small seeds are produced, but most are dispersed to a distance of less than a few dm from maternal plants, leading to strongly aggregated distribution patterns and significant spatial genetic structuring within natural populations. 6. Spiranthes spiralis has suffered significant declines in distribution in Britain and other European countries. In Britain, populations were lost from many sites before 1930, when many pastures were re-sown or converted to arable land. Losses of populations due to agricultural intensification (ploughing of old fields and fertilization) still occur and are the major causes of the decline of the species. Conservation of remnant populations primarily requires the maintenance of a short turf by grazing, most often by sheep. Ideally, grazing should be suspended during flowering and seed set, allowing new recruits to become established and adult plants to flower profusely and to produce seeds. © 2010 The Authors.

Fruit set is, however, consistently low (8-36% range). The pollination efficiency of male and female blueberry bees was studied using: 1. comparison of pollen loads on foraging male and female bees; 2. calculation of pollen loads on fresh stigmas of flowers exposed to a single visit by a female bee; and 3. an experimental test of fruit and seed set following exposure to one to eight visits by both male and female bees. Females had larger pollen loads in four of five body regions, but male bees consistently carried pollen in quantities sufficient for fertilization. A single visit from a female bee resulted in mixed pollen deposition of 76 pollen grains, 20 of which were from Gelsemium and 56 from Vaccinium. There was no significant relationship of either fruit or seed set with number of visits from either males or females. Whilst both male and female bees are effective as pollen delivery agents of G. sempervirens, much of the pollen they deliver may be from the same floral morph, leading to rejection in this self-incompatible distylous species. Low fruit set may also be related to other factors such as resource limitation and / or herbivory. © 2010 IBRA.",Article,Scopus

We demonstrate extensive crosshabitat gene flow by native bees, with pollination events spanning more than 1,800 m. Pollen was carried twice as far within shade coffee habitat as in nearby forest, and trees growing within shade coffee farms received pollen from a far greater number of sires than trees within remnant forest.

To preserve a crop's varietal purity or to restrict ingress into conventional varieties of genetically modified (GM) genes, a quantitative understanding of gene flow is useful. Previous measurements of gene flow in safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), a crop with GM varieties, were made in plots of less than 1. ha. Here, I evaluate a mathematical model of field-to-field gene flow due to insect pollination using parameter values appropriate to a large agricultural field of safflower. The model was solved based on laboratory pollination experiments and observations made on a large (40. ha) safflower field in Lethbridge, Canada that was pollinated by honey bees (Apis mellifera) and bumble bees (Bombus spp.). The model estimated the maximum feasible level of bee-mediated, field-to-field gene flow to range between 0.05% and 0.005% of seed set (95% upper confidence intervals of 0.23% and 0.023%), depending on the composition of the bee fauna. These relatively low values emerged for two reasons: safflower has a high capacity for automatic self-fertilization; and bees undertook long foraging bouts in the field, which made between-field pollinations relatively rare. A strategy for minimizing GM gene flow should utilize a conventional safflower variety that has a high capacity for automatic self-fertilization and should allow the conventional plants to grow in large stands to encourage long foraging bouts by bees. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Article,Scopus

Pollination is by bees or bats, raising the question of the evolutionary direction and frequency of pollinator shifts. Studies that investigated such shifts in other clades have suggested that bat pollination might be an evolutionary end point. Methods: Plastid and nuclear DNA sequences were obtained for 50 accessions representing 30 species of Cayaponia and close relatives, and analyses were carried out to test monophyly, infer divergence times, and reconstruct ancestral states for habitat preferences and pollination modes. Key results: The phylogeny shows that Cayaponia is monophyletic as long as Selysia (a genus with four species from Central and South America) is included. The required nomenclatural transfers are made in this paper. African and Madagascan accessions of C. africana form a clade that is part of a polytomy with Caribbean and South American species, and the inferred divergence time of 2-5 Ma implies a transoceanic dispersal event from the New World to Africa. The ancestral state reconstructions suggest that Cayaponia originated in tropical forests from where open savannas were reached several times and that bee pollination arose from bat pollination, roughly concomitant with the shifts from forests to savanna habitats. Conclusions: Cayaponia provides the first example of evolutionary transitions from bat to bee pollination as well as another instance of transoceanic dispersal from the New World to Africa. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Article,Scopus

In addition, as social haplodiploids, inbred bees may be vulnerable to the extra genetic load represented by the production of sterile diploid males. Using microsatellite markers, we investigated the genetic structure of populations of the Great Yellow Bumblebee (Bombus distinguendus Morawitz) in the UK, where this species has undergone a precipitous decline. By means of a mixture of analytical methods and simulation, we also extended - and then applied - genetic methods for estimating foraging distance and nest density in wild bees. B. distinguendus populations were characterized by low expected heterozygosity and allelic richness, inbreeding coefficients not significantly different from zero, absence of detected diploid males, absence of substantial demographic bottlenecking, and population substructuring at large (c. 100+ km) but not small (10s of km) spatial scales. The minimum average effective population size at our sampling sites was low (c. 25). In coastal grassland (machair), the estimated modal foraging distance of workers was 391 m, with 95% of foraging activity occurring within 955 m of the nest, and estimated nest density was 19.3 nests km-2. These findings show that B. distinguendus exhibits some genetic features of scarce, declining or fragmented populations. Moreover, B. distinguendus workers appear to forage over above-average distances and nests remain thinly distributed even in current strongholds. These considerations should inform future conservation actions for this and similar species. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Article,Scopus

The predefined probability of crime interaction in the GP model depends on the distance of a site from an offender's residence. We applied GP for predicting nest locations, assuming that foraging and nest sites were the crime sites and the offenders' residences, respectively. We identified the foraging and nest sites of the invasive species Bombus terrestris in 2004, 2005, and 2006. We fitted GP model coefficients to the field data of the foraging and nest sites, and used GP with the fitting coefficients. GP succeeded in predicting about 10-30% of actual nests. Sensitivity analysis showed that the predictability of the GP model mainly depended on the coefficient value of buffer zone, the distance at the mode of the foraging probability.

Contrary to this expectation, most of the bee species sampled on S. viscosa flowers were medium to large sized bees and harvested nectar in legitimate visits by activating the keel's pollination mechanism of flowers. However, the keel was always inactivated after being visited by the enormous and frequent (78%) Xylocopa bees. All the flowers visited by these bees (including those with inactivated keels), and those experimentally protected from bee visiting produced fruits (100%). The specialized embolus mechanism of the anthers assures self-pollination. Because of this autonomous self-pollination and self-compatibility it was not possible to discriminate the relative importance of both facilitated self-pollination and cross-pollination by bees. Nevertheless, the large Xylocopa bees didn't limit self-pollination. Xylocopa cearensis was the most abundant bee (63%) and it visited several flowers (13.0 ± 4.27) in each flight route in the same clump, in spite of the low floral density therein (5 to 20 flowers.m-2). Flight distances between successive flowers varied between one and two meters (49%), and so they were higher than would be possible (15 to 70 cm) given the floral density in the clumps. The flight routes were directional, and most of shifting direction between successive flowers was below 90° with high frequency of small angles (&lt;30°). This general pattern is explained by foraging optimization with adjustments to critical resource level thresholds. Paradoxically, floral biology and flowering pattern of S. viscosa should discourage the largest dune dweller bees, but this strategy works just temporarily. In this melittophilous species, the autonomous self-pollination (assured by the embolus) can be better explained by the automatic selection hypothesis rather than by reproductive assurance hypothesis, considering the availability of large bee pollinators in the tropical dunes.",Article,Scopus

The previous study revealed that red-phase flowers no longer have sexual function and nectar, and bumblebees selectively visit yellow-phase flowers. The present study examined how retaining color-changed flowers can regulate the foraging behavior of bumblebees and pollen transport among flowers within (geitonogamous pollination) and between (outcrossing pollination) plants and how the behavior is influenced by display size (i. e., number of functional flowers) and visitation frequency. The visitation frequencies of bumblebees to plants and successive flower probes within plants were observed in the field using plants whose flower number and composition of the two color-phase flowers had been manipulated. To evaluate pollination efficiency over multiple pollinator visits, a pollen transport model was constructed based on the observed bumblebee behavior. In the simulation, three flowering patterns associated with display size and existence of color-changed flowers were postulated as follows: Type 1, large display (100 functional flowers) and no retention of color-changed flowers; Type 2, small display (50 functional flowers) and retention of color-changed flowers (50 old flowers), and; Type 3, large display (100 functional flowers) and retention of color-changed flowers (100 old flowers). Color-changed flowers did not contribute to increasing bumblebee attraction at a distance but reduced the number of successive flower probes within plants. Comparisons of pollen transfer between Types 1 and 3 revealed that the retention of color-changed flowers did not influence the total amount of pollen exported when pollinator visits were abundant (>100 visits) but decreased geitonogamous pollination. Comparisons between Types 2 and 3 revealed that the discouragement effect of floral color change on successive probes accelerated in plants with a large display size. Overall, the floral color change strategy contributed to reduce geitonogamous pollination, but its effectiveness was highly sensitive to display size and pollinator frequency. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Article,Scopus

We tested the foraging rhythms of bumblebee (Bombus terrestris and B. pascuorum) colonies in northern Finland during the summer, when the sun stays above the horizon for weeks. We used fully automatic radio-frequency identification to monitor the foraging activity of more than 1,000 workers and analysed their circadian foraging rhythms.Results: Foragers did not use the available 24-h foraging period but exhibited robust diurnal rhythms instead. A mean of 95.2% of the tested B. terrestris workers showed robust diurnal rhythms with a mean period of 23.8 h. Foraging activity took place mainly between 08:00 and 23:00, with only low or almost no activity during the rest of the day. Activity levels increased steadily during the morning, reached a maximum around midday and decreased again during late afternoon and early evening. Foraging patterns of native B. pascuorum followed the same temporal organisation, with the foraging activity being restricted to the period between 06:00 and 22:00.Conclusions: The results of the present study indicate that the circadian clock of the foragers must have been entrained by some external cue, the most prominent being daily cycles in light intensity and temperature. Daily fluctuations in the spectral composition of light, especially in the UV range, could also be responsible for synchronising the circadian clock of the foragers under continuous daylight conditions. © 2010 Stelzer and Chittka; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus

It is endemic to the biodiversity hotspot of the southern Western Ghats of India and, besides ants, harbours many endemic invertebrate taxa, such as bees that pollinate it as well as arboreal earthworms, within swollen hollow stem internodes called domatia. Using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, three geographically separated populations were found to be multiclonal, characterized by high levels of clonal diversity. Values for the Simpson diversity index ranged between 0.764 and 0.964, and for Fager's evenness index between 0.00 and 0.036 for neighbourhoods within populations. This myrmecophyte was found to combine sexual recruitment (66.7%) and clonal production (33.3%) as methods of reproduction. Moderate amounts of genetic diversity at the species level were observed, with 52.63% polymorphism, and moderate values of Shannon's diversity index (0.1895) as well as of Nei's gene diversity (0.1186). In each population, observed genotypic diversity was significantly lower than expected, indicating significant genetic structure. Neighbour-joining trees demonstrated that Agumbe, which is the most northern population examined and geographically twice as far away from the other two populations, grouped separately and with larger bootstrap support from a larger cluster consisting of the Sampaji and Solaikolli populations, which are closer to each other geographically. Some neighbourhoods within each population showed spatial genetic structure even at small spatial scales of <5 m. A combination of clonality and short-distance pollen movement by small pollinating bees (Braunsapis puangensis) coupled with primary ballistic seed dispersal, and possible secondary seed dispersal by rodents, may contribute to spatial genetic structure at such small scales. The clonality of H. brunonis may be a factor that contributes to its dominance in Western Ghat forests where it supports a rich diversity of invertebrate fauna. © Indian Academy of Sciences.",Article,Scopus

This is also true for the introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMO) into agriculture. In Germany, precautionary regulations currently demand isolation distances (i. e. buffer zones) for the cultivation of genetically modified maize (Bt-maize) in the vicinity of conventional (150 m) and organic maize fields (300 m). The Bt-toxin may harm non-target organisms (NTO) such as Lepidoptera. Despite this, corresponding regulations for the protection of nature reserves are lacking to date. Conventional and Bt-maize have been grown in the vicinity of the Flora-Fauna-Habitat (FFH) Ruhlsdorfer Bruch in Brandenburg, Germany. The aim of this study was to investigate whether exposure of maize pollen from surrounding Bt-maize fields to NTOs in the nature protection area could be excluded or not. Two types of exposure were investigated: Firstly, whether maize pollen was dispersed by wind into the nature reserve area exposing resident NTOs. Secondly, foraging NTOs from the nature reserve are exposed by roaming the surrounding fields and collecting maize pollen. In order to fulfil the precautionary principle defined by law, the study should help to determine appropriate isolation distances for the cultivation f Bt-maize with regard to sustainable protection of NTOs in the FFH Ruhlsdorfer Bruch. In 2007, the local authorities issued an isolation distance between Bt-maize fields and nature reserves of 100 m and in 2008, this became 250 m in the northern and 500 m in the westerly direction, respectively. Materials and methods Standardised methods for biological and technical pollen sampling issued by the Association of German Engineers (VDI 4330 Part 3, 2007 and VDI 4330 Part 4, 2006) were applied providing a quality controlled and methodologically harmonised database which does not only serve the needs to be fulfilled by the present case-specific monitoring study but can also be used as a reference database for further investigations. Maize pollen exposure was measured within the FFH Ruhlsdorfer Bruch and its immediate vicinity in July and August 2007 and 2008. In 2007, the sampling was performed at three sites using 12 technical samplers (Sigma-2/PMF) placed at five measuring points at distances from 5 m to 120 m from the maize field edges. Additionally, for biological pollen sampling six bee colonies were situated at these three sites (two colonies at each site). The technical sampler Sigma-2/PMF enables point sampling which is primarily influenced by wind and topography providing information on effective maize pollen input (flow and deposition) at the measuring sites. Honey-bees roaming in the surrounding area with typical foraging distances of several kilometres may act as planar collectors. They may serve as indicators for the exposure to pollen-collecting NTOs. Furthermore, biological sampling is more selective due to the organism's preferences, whereas the technical sampling is neutral. Hence, both the technical and the biological sampling complement each other in their scope of application. The pollen samples of both matrices were analysed microscopically and the maize pollen loads were quantified. Pollen-DNA was analysed by means of the quantitative PCR-method (qPCR) identifying conventional and Bt-maize pollen by two independent laboratories. In 2008, the monitoring was repeated with additional sites. Eighteen technical samplers were exposed at five sites with eight measuring points at distances from 5 m to 250 m from the maize field edges. Two honey-bee colonies for biological sampling were placed at one site for control purposes. PCR-analyses were performed to measure the amounts of Bt-maize pollen in the samples. Results The results of pollen monitoring at the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch revealed maize pollen exposure for all monitoring sites in both surveys. In 2007, up to 1.75 million maize pollen/m2 were deposited at sites closest to the maize field. At 120 m from field edge in the middle of the FFH-reserve, 99,000 maize pollen/m2 were detected. In 2008, similar results were found, at distances up to 250 m from the field edges deposition of 164,000 maize pollen/m2 was detected. Data on maize pollen deposition show a clear distance relationship and are in accordance with results of further comprehensive surveys based on the same methodology (Hofmann 2007). The results of the microscopic analysis of the pollen pellets demonstrated that bees collected maize pollen at all sites, in 2007 and 2008. Although maize pollen is not the main food source (2007: 0.1-0.3 %; 2008:2-3 %) the collection efficiency of the bee colonies resulted in high amounts of sampled maize pollen with 4 to 11 million per site in 2007 and up to 467 million in 2008. Molecular-biological analysis of maize pollen DNA by qPCR demonstrated that transgenic Bt-MON810 DNA was present in all technical and biological samples, corroborated by two independent laboratories. In 2007, the GMO-content in the samples ranged up to 44 % in the bioaerosols and 49 % in the pollen pellets. In 2008, GMO-proportions of up to 18 % were detected. Discussion The results of this study provide evidence that NTOs in the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch were exposed to Bt-maize pollen under the cultivation conditions in 2007 with a buffer zone of 100 m. The GMO-content reached up to 48 %. The results of the monitoring in 2008 confirmed these findings. Even though the exposure could be reduced by increasing the isolation distances to 250 m and 500 m respectively, the results still show percentages of up to 18 % Bt-MON810 in the pollen samples. The results on maize pollen deposition at the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch in 2007 and 2008 correspond to the results of an investigation which was conducted over several years applying the same standardised method, but covering a wider range of distances. The correlation between maize pollen deposition (n/m2) and distance to the source field (m) fitted best to a power function of the type y = 1.2086 ""106"" x-0.548. Despite the same trend, the pollen deposition in the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch revealed above-average findings. Also the analysis of the pollen pellets collected by the bees showed an exposure in 2007 with values for the GMO-content of up to 49 %. For both methods, the exposure decreased in 2008 due to the greater buffer zones up to 500 m. Whereas the GMO-content for the biological sampling were reduced to values below 10 %, the values for the technical sampling were still higher indicating that greater buffer zones would be necessary for safety reasons under the precautionary principle. Conclusions The results of this investigation proved that maize pollen were dispersed by wind to distances farther than 250 m from field edge leading to maize pollen exposure in the centre of the nature reserve. The results also demonstrated that foraging NTOs living in the nature reserve were exposed to maize pollen from surrounding fields. Considering the cultivation of Bt-maize MON810, the assumption of the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) that there will be no relevant exposure beyond the Bt-maize fields, cannot be confirmed. Considering the results of this and related studies and with respect to the precautionary principle, one can state that buffer zones between Bt-maize fields and protected areas are an effective measure to minimise the exposure of Bt-maize pollen to NTOs and, thus, to prevent from adverse effects. Recommendations and perspectives Because of still insufficient ecotoxicological data for the risk assessment of Bt-maize MON810 considering butterflies and other protected NTOs, protection standards assuring the precautionary principle have to be implemented to avoid Bt-maize pollen exposure to NTOs. This applies for the case Ruhlsdorfer Bruch and for nature reserve areas in general. In order to exclude risks to protected NTOs occurring in nature reserves, sufficient buffer zones for Bt-maize cultivation should be considered. The statistical analysis revealed that distances of more than 500 m are necessary to decisively reduce exposure to foraging insects. In fact, distances of more than 1,000 m are necessary to prevent maize pollen deposition from values above 100,000 pollen/m2 with a certainty of 90 %. An adequate risk assessment can only be attained if based on field measurements accounting for the high variation of pollen deposition due to local environmental site conditions and field management. The monitoring should be based on standardised methods. It should include locations with the highest expected deposition rates, the boundaries of the protected areas and sites of interest within those boundaries, e. g., specific habitats of sensitive species. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",Article,Scopus

Observational studies suggest that there are a set of conditions required for the production of toxic honey, but these factors have not been well studied. This research aims to investigate the importance of altitude and weather conditions for the production of toxic honey in New Zealand and makes some recommendations for a review of the New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA) Food (tutin in honey) Standard 2008 that was introduced after a toxic honey outbreak in 2008. Transects were established in parts of the North Island during the summer of 2009 and were visited weekly for 6 consecutive weeks. Variables recorded were elevation, S. australis density, honeydew abundance, honey bee and wasp (Vespula spp.) presence and temperature and rainfall data. Weather conditions present during the 2008 outbreak were compared with those from 1999 to 2009. S. australis were not present at altitudes of 375 m and above; with more research, some higher areas of New Zealand may be able to be reclassified as 'low risk'. Honeydew was available in a wide range of temperature and rainfall conditions. Rainfall appeared to wash honeydew from tutu bushes; however, it quickly reappeared in densely populated sites. Honey bee and wasp presence was positively affected by the presence of honeydew, nevertheless 3-50% of the time they were observed foraging in the absence of honeydew, indicating they may feed on small amounts of dew. As the absence of honeydew is an option given by the NZFSA to demonstrate honey safety, this requires investigation. Weather conditions leading up to the 2008 toxic honey outbreak were warm and dry but were not significantly different from other years. Therefore, inadequate management practices, rather than more favourable environmental conditions were probably responsible for the 2008 toxic honey outbreak. Future research should focus on determining the conditions required for toxic levels of honeydew to be incorporated into hives, and regions that have not produced toxic honey historically should be closely studied to determine whether any fit the low-risk criteria. © 2010 The Royal Society of New Zealand.",Article,Scopus

By providing refuge for wild plants and the pollinators associated with them, field margins can also contribute to enhancing the pollination services within the monoculture. However, the effects of the monoculture on pollinator behaviour need to be carefully considered. It is known that pollinators may show density-dependent preferences such as neophobia (an avoidance of unfamiliar items) when different types of flower are available within their environment, and the dominance of monoculture crops within the environment may consequently have adverse effects upon the preferences shown by pollinators living in the field margins within them. In order to examine how pollinator preferences for wild flowers are affected by monocultures, we modelled the effects of density-dependent preferences, flower densities, and the geometry of field margins within a monoculture landscape using numerical simulations. This was done by considering how the placement of pollinator nests within a simple, spatially explicit landscape consisting of fields of monoculture crops separated by margins containing wild flowers affected the ratio of wild and monoculture crops experienced by the pollinator, given that it could only forage within a limited distance from its nest. Increasing field margin width and decreasing monoculture field width both led to an increase in pollinators visiting wild flowers (which levelled off as width increased). The size of the monoculture fields had little additional effect once they had passed an intermediate width. Increasing wild flower density within the margins led to a shift away from preferring monocultures. When wild flowers were at low densities compared to the monoculture, even the addition of small amounts of extra wild flowers had a large effect in shifting foraging preferences away from the monoculture. The distance which pollinators normally forage over only has an effect upon preferences for wild flowers when the travel distance is small. This suggests that careful consideration of margin design might be extremely important for those species which do not travel far. Innate preferences for density-dependence and particular crop types may also have an effect on preference behaviour. We demonstrate that the way in which resources are presented to indigenous pollinators may be extremely important in influencing where they choose to forage within agricultural landscapes. Careful margin design, as well as increasing the density of wild flowers (such as by enhancing the wild seed bank within the margins), may lead to overall improvements in ecosystem function within intensively farmed monocultures. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we test this hypothesis by examining how variation in the indication of direction and distance changes with respect to distance.

Solitary bees are central place foragers returning to their nests several times a day with pollen and nectar to provision their brood cells. They are especially susceptible to landscape changes that lead to an increased spatial separation of suitable nesting sites and flower rich host plant stands. While knowledge of bee foraging ranges is currently growing, quantitative data on the costs of foraging flights are very scarce, although such data are crucial to understand bee population dynamics. 2. In this study, the impact of increased foraging distance on the duration of foraging bouts and on the number of brood cells provisioned per time unit was experimentally quantified in the two pollen specialist solitary bee species Hoplitis adunca and Chelostoma rapunculi. Females nesting at different sites foraged under the same environmental conditions on a single large and movable flowering host plant patch in an otherwise host plant free landscape. 3. The number of brood cells provisioned per time unit by H. adunca was found to decrease by 23%, 31% and 26% with an increase in the foraging distance by 150, 200 and 300 m, respectively. The number of brood cells provisioned by C. rapunculi decreased by 46% and 36% with an increase in the foraging distance by 500 and 600 m, respectively. 4. Contrary to expectation, a widely scattered arrangement of host plants did not result in longer mean duration of a foraging bout in H. adunca compared to a highly aggregated arrangement, which might be due to a reduced flight directionality combined with a high rate of revisitation of already depleted flowers in the aggregated plant arrangement or by a stronger competition and disturbance by other flower visitors. 5. The results of this study clearly indicate that a close neighbourhood of suitable nesting and foraging habitats is crucial for population persistence and thus conservation of endangered solitary bee species. © 2010 The Authors.

We compared the resource use (pollen diets) among seven feral colonies of Bombus ardens located in an area of 2.5 × 2.5 km2. Because this area was likely to be within their maximum foraging distance, most floral resources could have been accessible to all colonies alike. Similarities in pollen diets among these colonies may suggest that the surrounding resources determine resources use, while deviations from this could reveal other factors that affect resources use among colonies. We examined if colonies showed similarities in pollen diets and if colonies do differ in pollen diets, we investigated whether factors, such as establishment year, colony size, and location, affected the colony pollen diets. We found that while the choices of floral resources were similar, the proportional use of the floral resources were significantly different, suggesting that the surrounding resources do not solely determine resource use among colonies. Further analyses showed that the dissimilarity of pollen diets between two colonies increased as spatial distance decreased, as the temporal distances increased, and as the difference in colony size increased. We found that other than differences in annual variances of resources distribution, colony size was the prominent factor that affected the resource use of our seven colonies.

Bees were trained to feeders in flight tunnels such that bees experienced the greatest optic flow en route to the feeder closest to the hive. Analyses of dance communication showed that, as expected, bees indicated the close feeder as being further, but they also indicated this feeder as the more profitable, and preferentially visited this feeder when given a choice. We show that honeybee estimates of foraging cost are not reliant on optic flow information. Rather, bees can assess distance and profitability independently and signal these aspects as separate elements of their dances. The optic flow signal is sensitive to the nature of the environment travelled by the bee, and is therefore not a good index of flight energetic costs, but it provides a good indication of distance travelled for purpose of navigation and communication, as long as the dancer and recruit travel similar routes. This study suggests an adaptive dual processing system in honeybees for communicating and navigating distance flown and for evaluating its energetic costs. © 2009 The Royal Society.",Article,Scopus

However, their function within the motivational system remains unclear. I tested the hypothesis that displacement activities have a functional role during transitions between motivational states, using the honeybee model system. I observed a number of locomotory and grooming behaviours performed when foraging honeybees returned to the hive to dance. These focal behaviours occurred significantly more frequently during the period of transition from waggle dancing to exiting the hive to forage than during the periods before the waggle dance or during the waggle dance. By contrast, the control behaviour, trophallaxis, was distributed across time periods significantly differently, occurring with equal frequency in all periods. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that displacement activities have a functional role during motivational transitions. Evidence from other species suggests that the most likely function is facilitation, rather than inhibition, of the transition. The wide range of species in which displacement activities have been identified suggests that they are a universal feature of motivational control. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Article,Scopus

In the last years this phenomenon has become increasingly serious, and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain honey bee and colony losses. These hypotheses relate to pests and diseases, pesticides, apicultural practices, climate change, electromagnetic fields, GMO crops, etc. Honey bee colony losses are being surveyed in several European countries, but these surveys are not sufficiently structured. Based on beekeepers' reports, honey bee losses in Italy follow a clear seasonal pattern: a) during spring and summer colonies lose many foragers due to agrochemicals (bee losses); b) from late summer to winter, the impact of pests (including Varroa) and pathogens becomes more important (colony losses). To assess the extent and investigate the possible causes of honey bee and colony losses in Italy a national monitoring network needs to be established. Target apiaries will be distributed in selected-sites (modules), ideally one per region to cover the national territory. Each module, composed of five apiaries- with ten non-migratory colonies each, will be chosen based on environmental characteristics with a distance tojhe center of the module of about 50 km. Colonies will be visually inspected four times a year (right after winter, spring, summer and just before winter).-In each inspection several parameters of each colony will- be'considered-health and nutritional condition, number of bees and brood, and queen's age. The person in charge of each module will input the information obtained in a real-time database available on the Internet. In addition, dead and live bees, as well as several beehive matrices (brood, pollen, wax) will be collected during each inspection for chemical, pollen and disease analyses. The information collected through this honey-bee monitoring network will provide a broad database from which to explore patterns of disease, toxic exposure and management practices that may be linked to the occurrence of honey bee and colony losses.

To fill this gap in pollinator decline censuses and to provide a broad picture of the current status of honeybees across their natural range, we used microsatellite genetic markers to estimate colony densities and genetic diversity at different locations in Europe, Africa, and central Asia that had different patterns of land use. Genetic diversity and colony densities were highest in South Africa and lowest in Northern Europe and were correlated with mean annual temperature. Confounding factors not related to climate, however, are also likely to influence genetic diversity and colony densities in honeybee populations. Land use showed a significantly negative influence over genetic diversity and the density of honeybee colonies over all sampling locations. In Europe honeybees sampled in nature reserves had genetic diversity and colony densities similar to those sampled in agricultural landscapes, which suggests that the former are not wild but may have come from managed hives. Other results also support this idea: putative wild bees were rare in our European samples, and the mean estimated density of honeybee colonies on the continent closely resembled the reported mean number of managed hives. Current densities of European honeybee populations are in the same range as those found in the adverse climatic conditions of the Kalahari and Saharan deserts, which suggests that beekeeping activities do not compensate for the loss of wild colonies. Our findings highlight the importance of reconsidering the conservation status of honeybees in Europe and of regarding beekeeping not only as a profitable business for producing honey, but also as an essential component of biodiversity conservation. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.",Article,Scopus

Previous investigations predicted maximum foraging distances of 100-200 m for small bee species and up to 1100 m for very large species based on mainly indirect methods. The present study applied a new and direct approach to experimentally investigate maximum foraging distances in solitary bees. One endangered and two common species of different body sizes, all of which restrict pollen foraging to a single plant genus, were established in a landscape lacking their specific host plants. Females were forced to collect pollen on potted host plants that were successively placed in increasing distance from fixed nesting stands. The maximum foraging distance recorded for the small Hylaeus punctulatissimus was 1100 m, for the medium sized Chelostoma rapunculi 1275 m and for the large Hoplitis adunca 1400 m, indicating that maximum foraging distances at species level have been underestimated. However, the capability to use resources on such a large spatial scale applied only to a small percentage of individuals as 50% of the females of H. punctulatissimus and H. adunca did not forage at distances longer than 100-225 m and 300 m, respectively. This finding suggests that a close neighbourhood of nesting and foraging habitat within few hundred meters is crucial to maintain populations of these species, and that threshold distances at which half of the population discontinues foraging are a more meaningful parameter for conservation practice than the species specific maximum foraging distances. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Dispersal of B. terrestris gained momentum in the 1980s when bees were reared artificially in Europe and supplied commercially for greenhouse pollination services. Very early after its commercial introduction, it was recognized that this species is invasive, can island hop to new locations and may disturb local ecosystems. The invasive characteristics of B. terrestris are: high migration ability, early seasonal emergence, high adaptability under adverse climatic conditions in various habitats, generalist or polylectic foraging strategies, enabling it to work a wide variety of flowers for resources, foraging over wide distances, a thermoregulatory metabolism that enables it to withstand low temperatures, no natural enemies to check population growth in areas outside its natural range, and it may develop two reproductive cycles in a year (bivoltine) in a newly colonized area. In addition, commercial bees produce more gynes and are better competitors than the local conspecific populations and may replace them in the likely event of an escape. The documented evidence on invasive impact of B. terrestris on natural ecosystems includes: negative interactions with local bee fauna, competition for nest sites with, and genetic contamination of, local Bombus spp., spread of parasites and pathogens and negative interactions with plant reproductive capacity. We discuss the possible measures that must be taken to minimize the B. terrestris invasion on local as well as on global levels.",Short Survey,Scopus

Nests of bumble bees are hardly found in nature. A prospective alternative is estimating the number of nests with polymorphic genetic data of individuals foraging in the field. Full-sib reconstruction from such genetic data is NP-hard in a strict sense, but several heuristic methods have been proposed. Among them, likelihood methods have been often applied for reconstructing full-sibs in nature, but they require relatively large sample sizes for obtaining accuracy in allele frequencies. Alternative methods calculate genetic distances between paired individuals and cluster them into family groups, but there are also pros and cons for applying these methods against real data. We proposed another heuristic pairing and clustering method, Shared Loci Correspondence Analysis (SLCA), for reconstructing full-sib families of haplodipoid populations. In SLCA, genetic similarities among individuals are numbers of loci shared by the paired individuals. The similarity scores are sorted by the correspondence analysis for clustering them into full-sib families. SLCA could be applicable to quite small samples and succeeded to correctly estimate the number of bumble bee nests in the field. We also improved estimation accuracy of SLCA by blunting the similarity index among individuals. The modified SLCA performed almost perfectly against challenging problems when numbers of loci and alleles were equal or greater than eight.

Here we quantify queen dispersal in two common bumblebee species in an arable landscape. Dispersal was measured by taking DNA samples from workers in the spring and summer, and from queens in the following spring, at 14 sites across a landscape. The queens captured in the spring must be full sisters of workers that were foraging in the previous year. A range of sibship reconstruction methods were compared using simulated data sets including or no genotyping errors. The program Colony gave the most accurate reconstruction and was used for our analysis of queen dispersal. Comparison of queen dispersion with worker foraging distances was used to take into account an expected low level of false identification of sister pairs which might otherwise lead to overestimates of dispersal. Our data show that Bombus pascuorum and B. lapidarius queens can disperse by at least 3 and 5 km, respectively. These estimates are consistent with inferences drawn from studies of population structuring in common and rare bumblebee species, and suggest that regular gene flow over several kilometres due to queen dispersal are likely to be sufficient to maintain genetic cohesion of ubiquitous species over large spatial scales whereas rare bumblebee species appear unable to regularly disperse over distances greater than 10 km.

The predominant form of agricultural land management in this region is crofting, a system specific to Scotland in which small agricultural units (crofts) operate rotational cropping and grazing regimes. Crofting is considered to be beneficial to a wide range of flora and fauna. However, currently there is a lack of quantitative evidence to support this view with regard to bumblebee populations. In this study we assessed the effect of land management on the abundance of foraging bumblebees and the availability of bumblebee forage plants across crofts in northwest Scotland. The results of our study show that current crofting practices do not support high densities of foraging bumblebees. Traditional crofting practice was to move livestock to uplands in the summer, but this has been largely abandoned. Summer sheep grazing of lowland pasture had a strong negative impact on bumblebee abundance and forage plant availability throughout the survey period. The use of specific 'bird and bee' conservation seed mixes appears to improve forage availability within the crofted landscape, although the number of bees observed remained low. Of the forage plants available, the three most frequently visited species were from the Fabaceae. We therefore conclude that the creation of agri-environment schemes which promote the use of Fabaceae-rich seed mixes and encourage the removal of sheep grazing on lowland areas throughout the summer are essential in order to conserve bumblebee populations within crofted areas. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we quantify and compare dispersal abilities of two bumblebee species, Bombus muscorum and Bombus jonellus, in a model island system. We use microsatellites to investigate population genetic structuring, dispersal and spatial patterns in genetic diversity. Populations of both species showed significant structuring, and isolation by distance, but this was markedly greater in B. muscorum (θ = 0.13) than in B. jonellus (θ = 0.034).

In the field it is likely that worker bees are exposed to pesticides during foraging. To date, several tests exist to assess lethal and sublethal side-effects of pesticides on bee survival, growth/development and reproduction. Within the context of ecotoxicology and insect physiology, we report the development of a new bioassay to assess the impact of sublethal concentrations on the bumblebee foraging behavior under laboratory conditions. In brief, the experimental setup of this behavior test consists of two artificial nests connected with a tube of about 20 cm and use of queenless micro-colonies of 5 workers. In one nest the worker bees constructed brood, and in the other food (sugar and pollen) was provided. Before exposure, the worker bees were allowed a training to forage for untreated food; afterwards this was replaced by treated food. Using this setup we investigated the effects of sublethal concentrations of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, known to negatively affect the foraging behavior of bees. For comparison within the family of neonicotinoid insecticides, we also tested different concentrations of two other neonicotinoids: thiamethoxam and thiacloprid, in the laboratory with the new bioassay. Finally to evaluate the new bioassay, we also tested sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid in the greenhouse with use of queenright colonies of B. terrestris, and here worker bees needed to forage/fly for food that was placed at a distance of 3 m from their hives. In general, the experiments showed that concentrations that may be considered safe for bumblebees can have a negative influence on their foraging behavior. Therefore it is recommended that behavior tests should be included in risk assessment tests for highly toxic pesticides because impairment of the foraging behavior can result in a decreased pollination, lower reproduction and finally in colony mortality due to a lack of food. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Article,Scopus

Parameter extraction in MESFET process involves minimizing the error, which is measured as the difference between modeled and measured S parameter over a broad frequency range. This error surface is viewed as a multi-modal error surface and robust optimization algorithms are required to solve this kind of problem. This paper proposes an ABC algorithm that simulates the foraging behavior of honey bee swarm for model parameter extraction. The performance comparison of both the algorithms (ABC and PSO) are compared with respect to computational time and the quality of solutions (QoS). The simulation results illustrate that these techniques extract accurately the 16-element small signal model parameters of MESFET. The efficiency of this approach is demonstrated by a good fit between the measured and modeled S-parameter data over a frequency range of 0.5- 25 GHz.© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied several aspects of its reproductive biology, including potential pollinators, floral biology, and diurnal and seasonal flowering phenology. Flower visitors were observed in G. tomentosum populations on O'ahu, Kaho'olawe, and Maui. Primary visitors were introduced species, honeybees and carpenter bees, both of which were pollinating the flowers. No native bee species were seen visiting flowers. In examining floral biology we found that in some cases 10% of flowers had styles that were as short as the anthers or were recurved toward the anthers. In the greenhouse, in the absence of pollinators, these flowers were the only ones that set fruit. Flowering of G. tomentosum commences in January and February, following the rainy season, peaks in May, and may continue into August and September. In one year, after higher than average precipitation during the rainy season, there was a greater abundance of flowering, and flowering persisted later into the year. Transgenic varieties of commercial cotton, G. hirsutum, are grown in Hawai'i and are interfertile with G. tomentosum. Honeybees and carpenter bees are also known pollinators of commercial cotton. Because these pollinators are long-distance foragers, we estimate that transgenic cotton fields would have to be greater than 10 km from a G. tomentosum population to prevent gene flow. © 2010 by University of Hawai'i Press.",Article,Scopus

Firstly the heterogeneous swarm model is identified and the swarm cohesion is proved, and the analytical bound on the swarm size is provided. Secondly, the foraging properties of the heterogeneous swarm in multimodal Gaussian environment are studied, and conditions for collective convergence to more favorable regions are provided.

This reorganization of the adult nervous system is shaped by internal and external influences both during development and adult maturation. In adults, behavioural experience is a major driving force of neuronal plasticity studied particularly in sensory systems. The range of adaptation depends on features that are important to a particular species, so that learning is essential for foraging in honeybees, while regenerative capacities are important in hemimetabolous insects with long appendages. Experience is usually effective during a critical period in early adult life, when neural function becomes tuned to future conditions in an insect's life.

We studied the effect of honeybees on the foraging behavior of native solitary bees in Israel, within the natural distribution range of the honeybee, by manipulating the presence and absence of beehives in the study sites: Ramat Hanadiv Park and Carmel National Park. We examined the possible degree of competition between honeybees and native solitary bees by observing their foraging on focal nectariferous plants. Temporal introduction of hives increased the visitation frequencies of honeybees to our focal plants and decreased the overall average visitation frequencies of native solitary bees. However, the effect of honeybees varied among native bee species, focal plants, and years. In some cases, honeybees had a negative effect on visitation rates of the other bees, while in other cases we did not find such an effect. The other bees also did not shift to forage on other flowering plants, and did not change their temporal activity pattern as a response to increased foraging by honeybees. The results provide partial evidence for behavioral competition between honeybees and native bees. For this reason, we recommend prohibiting introduction of beehives to all nature reserves in Israel, as a precaution aimed at protecting the native bee fauna.

Beekeeping is the establishment and tending of colonies of social bees of any species. Most of the world's beekeeping is done with A. mellifera. Beekeeping is done mainly to produce honey, but there are also other specialized types of operations. These include the rearing of queens or package bees for other beekeepers who are producing honey. Another type of beekeeping provides colonies of bees to pollinate crops, since in many areas of large-scale agriculture, the native pollinators have been destroyed. Each type of beekeeping requires the management of colonies to stimulate the bees to do what the beekeeper wants-for instance, to rear more young house bees to produce royal jelly or more foragers to pollinate crops. So it is essential that hives and frames have standard dimensions and that an accessory (spacer) is used to ensure that frames are always exactly the correct distance apart. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Experimental evidence for magnetic field sensitivity has been reported in insects belonging to various orders, including Isoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera. There is evidence that a few insect species obtain directional information from geomagnetic fields for compass orientation. Two alternative properties of the local geomagnetic vector could serve this purpose. Magnetic compass orientation can be useful for insects in the context of home range (topographic) orientation and during long-distance migration, especially in the absence of visual compass cues. Both honey bees building combs in darkness and blind termites building oriented mounds appear to use magnetoreception for aligning their structures. On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine how an insect could make adaptive use of sensing the absolute strength of the local geomagnetic field. In flight, the honeybee, Apis mellifera, also uses a magnetic compass in home range orientation. Foraging bees approaching the vicinity of their ""target"" learn the precise location of resources with respect to surrounding landmarks so they can return to the same place in the future. The most popular hypothesis assumes fast ""snapshot""--like recall of near-target constellations of landmarks. The returning bee finds the target location by matching the current perception of landmarks with the ""snapshot memories"" of them. While learning the spatial relations of landmarks, bees face in a preferred compass direction, using directional light and the geomagnetic field. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This behaviour is adaptive because remaining undiscovered is the termite's primary defence against predators such as ants. However, being cryptic severely limits the ability of termites to explore their environment and assess potential food sources. Despite being blind and hidden, termites can assess a piece of wood swiftly after contacting only a small part of it (sometimes as little as a few square millimetres). Such ability has been a mystery. Unlike bees and ants, which have been found to use a range of visual, chemical and vibrational cues for communication, how information is collected and transmitted between termites is poorly known. In addition, the use of chemical communication by termites has been shown to be very limited compared to other social insects. While previous research showed that termite soldiers produce vibratory alarm signals to warn conspecific workers, the role of vibrations in termite foraging behaviour has scarcely been explored. Recent results are presented to demonstrate termites' ability to detect vibration signals and to use the information contained in these signals to make foraging decisions.",Conference Paper,Scopus

To study these searching patterns, foraging honeybees were trained to a scented feeder which was then removed. Two new unrewarding feeders, or 'targets', were then positioned up- and downwind of the original location of the training feeder. The subsequent flight patterns of the bees were recorded over several hundred metres using harmonic radar. We show that the flight patterns constitute an optimal Lévy flight searching strategy for the location of the training feeder, a strategy that is also optimal for the location of alternative food sources when patchily distributed.

In particular, better knowledge of which habitats bees utilize for foraging over their lifetime would inform a range of applied and theoretical questions. Traditional methods of studying foraging are either impractical for insects (e.g. radio tracking) or else are limited spatially or temporally (e.g. observations by researchers). Here we describe a method for using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen from bee tissues to gain an integrated signal of which habitats a bee has foraged in over its lifetime, using three species of social stingless bee (Apidae: Meliponini) in a fragmented tropical forest landscape in southern Costa Rica as a test case. There were strongly significant differences in the carbon and nitrogen isotope signals of bees collected in the landscape extremes: the largest forests and largest open pastures in the region. We could not estimate proportions of dietary carbon and nitrogen derived from different habitats, however, due to the high sample variance. Still, isotope ratios reflect a signature of the habitat that a bee has foraged in, and we found significant relationships between foraging patterns and season, landscape context (proportion of forest surrounding sample sites) and local biotic context (bee and plant diversity and abundance). Landscape context was the most consistent factor among the analyses, in line with the idea that meliponines do not preferentially forage in deforested habitats. Bee and plant diversity and abundance showed various significant relationships with the isotopic values of the different species, but the patterns were inconsistent. These results are potentially consistent with habitat switching from pasture to forest in areas of greater competition, but the extreme spatiotemporal variability in resource density likely blurs these patterns. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here we show that honeybees returning from foraging on dangerous flowers are less likely to perform the waggle dance and engage in fewer waggle runs than foragers returning from equally rewarding, safe flowers.

Uncorrected pairwise distances among the eight haplotypes suggested low intraspecific genetic diversity, with a maximum sequence divergence of 0.3%. Such a low level of intraspecific genetic diversity was further reflected in local populations, particularly to islet populations, such as those of Youngheungdo, Jakyakdo, and Ulleugdo, which had zero genetic diversity. Geographically, one haplotype (BARBA01) was widespread and dominant, with a frequency of 90.6% (145 among 160 individuals). Other haplotypes were restricted to one to three localities and had low frequency. Overall, a very high rate of per generation female migration ratio (Nm = 4.6 to infinite) and a very low level of genetic fixation (FST = 0 to 0.099) were detected between pairs of localities, suggesting that the B. ardens populations on the Korean peninsula are panmictic, which is consistent with our understanding of their dispersal capability. © 2009 Korean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society.",Article,Scopus

However, WSNs system designers must fulfill the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements imposed by the applications (and users). Very harsh and dynamic physical environments and extremely limited energy/computing/memory/communication node resources are major obstacles for satisfying QoS metrics such as reliability, timeliness, and system lifetime. The limited communication range of WSN nodes, link asymmetry, and the characteristics of the physical environment lead to a major source of QoS degradation in WSNsthe hidden node problem. In wireless contention-based medium access control (MAC) protocols, when two nodes that are not visible to each other transmit to a third node that is visible to the former, there will be a collisioncalled hidden-node or blind collision. This problem greatly impacts network throughput, energy-efficiency and message transfer delays, and the problem dramatically increases with the number of nodes. This paper proposes H-NAMe, a very simple yet extremely efficient hidden-node avoidance mechanism for WSNs. H-NAMe relies on a grouping strategy that splits each cluster of a WSN into disjoint groups of non-hidden nodes that scales to multiple clusters via a cluster grouping strategy that guarantees no interference between overlapping clusters. Importantly, H-NAMe is instantiated in IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee, which currently are the most widespread communication technologies for WSNs, with only minor add-ons and ensuring backward compatibility with their protocols standards. H-NAMe was implemented and exhaustively tested using an experimental test-bed based on off-the-shelf technology, showing that it increases network throughput and transmission success probability up to twice the values obtained without H-NAMe. H-NAMe effectiveness was also demonstrated in a target tracking application with mobile robots over a WSN deployment. © 2006 IEEE.",Article,Scopus

Management of lowland mesotrophic grasslands in north-west Europe often makes use of inorganic fertilizers, high stocking densities and silage-based forage systems to maximize productivity. The impact of these practices has resulted in a simplification of the plant community combined with wide-scale declines in the species richness of grassland invertebrates. We aim to identify how field margin management can be used to promote invertebrate diversity across a suite of functionally diverse taxa (beetles, planthoppers, true bugs, butterflies, bumblebees and spiders). 2. Using an information theoretic approach we identify the impacts of management (cattle grazing, cutting and inorganic fertilizer) and plant community composition (forb species richness, grass species richness and sward architecture) on invertebrate species richness and body size. As many of these management practices are common to grassland systems throughout the world, understanding invertebrate responses to them is important for the maintenance of biodiversity. 3. Sward architecture was identified as the primary factor promoting increased species richness of both predatory and phytophagous trophic levels, as well as being positively correlated with mean body size. In all cases phytophagous invertebrate species richness was positively correlated with measures of plant species richness. 4. The direct effects of management practices appear to be comparatively weak, suggesting that their impacts are indirect and mediated though the continuous measures of plant community structure, such as sward architecture or plant species richness. 5. Synthesis and applications. By partitioning field margins from the remainder of the field, economically viable intensive grassland management can be combined with extensive management aimed at promoting native biodiversity. The absence of inorganic fertilizer, combined with a reduction in the intensity of both cutting and grazing regimes, promotes floral species richness and sward architectural complexity. By increasing sward architecture the total biomass of invertebrates also increased (by c. 60% across the range of sward architectural measures seen in this study), increasing food available for higher trophic levels, such as birds and mammals. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Article,Scopus

(Primrose) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, ?oral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Primula vulgaris is a native perennial herb with a very wide distribution in the British Isles. In many lowland areas it is essentially a plant of woodlands and hedgerows, although in the west it can occur abundantly in grasslands and other communities such as heaths. In northern and western Britain and Ireland, it may be frequent in open and even exposed habitats. Its distribution is linked with soil moisture and atmospheric humidity. It is shade tolerant, but it ?owers most profusely in canopy gaps. 3. Primula vulgaris is a rosette hemicryptophyte that reproduces mainly through seeds. Vegetative spread is restricted and only occurs within very short distances from the mother plant through the production of lateral rosettes. Although individual rosettes may die, plants are relatively long-lived (life expectancy of a newborn individual: 48.3 years). The mean age at ?rst ?owering was 20 months. 4. Pollination is mainly by bumblebees and other bees, but other long-tongued pollinators including syrphids, bee-?ies and even butter?ies may be locally important. P. vulgaris is an obligate outbreeder, with two genetically determined self-incompatible morphs (pin and thrum). A third morph (homostyle or long homostyle), with a stigma like that of pin but anthers like that of thrum, has been found in Somerset and North Dorset. In years when pollinators are scarce, homostyles have higher reproductive success than pins and thrums, suggesting that reproductive assurance could have had a profound effect on the evolution of homostyly in P. vulgaris. 5. Seeds are dispersed by ants and rodents. Dispersal is usually restricted to a few centimetres or decimetres from maternal plants, resulting in signi?cant ?ne-scale spatial genetic structure and small neighbourhood sizes. Pollen ?ow, on the other hand, is more extensive, but still limited to a few metres from paternal plants. 6. Populations of P. vulgaris have not changed markedly during the last century in most parts of Britain and Ireland and it is not threatened with extinction nationally.

It thus plays a major role in pollinator floral constancy and plant gene flow. Honeybees are the primary model for pollinator associative learning, but bumblebees play an important ecological role in a wider range of habitats, and their associative learning abilities are less well understood. We assayed learning with the proboscis extension reflex (PER), using a novel method for restraining bees (capsules) designed to improve bumblebee learning. We present the first results demonstrating that bumblebees exhibit the memory spacing effect. They improve their associative learning of odor and nectar reward by exhibiting increased memory acquisition, a component of long-term memory formation, when the time interval between rewarding trials is increased. Bombus impatiens forager memory acquisition (average discrimination index values) improved by 129% and 65% at inter-trial intervals (ITI) of 5 and 3 min, respectively, as compared to an ITI of 1 min. Memory acquisition rate also increased with increasing ITI. Encapsulation significantly increases olfactory memory acquisition. Ten times more foragers exhibited at least one PER response during training in capsules as compared to traditional PER harnesses. Thus, a novel conditioning assay, encapsulation, enabled us to improve bumblebee-learning acquisition and demonstrate that spaced learning results in better memory consolidation. Such spaced learning likely plays a role in forming long-term memories of rewarding floral resources. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

These detritus decorations have been hypothesised to camouflage the spider from predators or prey and thus reduce predation risk or increase foraging success. In the present study, we tested these two alternative hypotheses simultaneously using two types of detritus decorations (prey remain and egg sac) built by Cyclosa mulmeinensis (Thorell). By monitoring the possible responses of predators to spiders on their webs with and without decorations in the field, we tested whether web decorations would reduce the mortality of spiders. Wasp predators were observed to fly in the vicinity of webs with decorations slightly more often than in the vicinity of webs without decorations but there were very few attacks on spiders by wasps. By comparing the insect interception rates of webs with and without decorations in the field, we tested whether web decorations would increase the foraging success. Webs decorated with prey remains or egg sacs intercepted more insects than those without in the field. By calculating colour contrasts of both prey-remain and egg-sac decorations against spiders viewed by bird (blue tits) and hymenopteran (e.g. wasps) predators as well as hymenopteran (bees) prey, we showed that C. mulmeinensis spiders on webs with egg-sac decorations were invisible to both hymenopteran prey and predators and bird predators over short and long distances. While spiders on webs with prey-remain decorations were invisible to both hymenopterans and birds over short distances, spiders on webs with prey-remain decorations were visible to both predators and prey over long distances. Our results thus suggest that decorating webs with prey remains and egg sacs in C. mulmeinensis may primarily function as camouflage to conceal the spider from insects rather than as prey attractants, possibly contributing to the interception of more insect prey. However, the detritus decorations exhibit varying success as camouflage against predators, depending on whether predators are jumping spiders, wasps or birds, as well as on the decoration type.",Article,Scopus

Many use changing signals as indicators that visitation and/or pollination have occurred [2, 3]). Floral color change is commonly used to transmit this information [3-7] (often correlated with reduced nectar reward [8, 9]) and can be specifically triggered by pollination or visitation. By retaining color-changed flowers, plants benefit from larger floral displays but also indicate at close range which flowers are still rewarding (and still unpollinated), so that visitors forage more efficiently [5, 6]. However, the legume Desmodium setigerum shows a unique ability, if inadequately pollinated, to reverse its flowers' color and shape changes. Single visits by bees mechanically depress the keel and expose stigma and anthers (termed ""tripping""); visits also initiate a rapid color change from lilac to white and turquoise and a slower morphological change, the upper petal folding downwards over the reproductive parts. But flowers receiving insufficient pollen can partially reopen, re-exposing the stigma, with a further color change to deeper turquoise and/or lilac. Thus, most flowers achieve pollination from one bee visit, but those with inadequate pollen receipt can reverse their signals, earning a ""second chance"" by eliciting attention from other potential pollinators. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the foraging behavior of pollinators, especially Osmia cornifrons Radoszkowski, in order to evaluate their use instead of honeybees. O. cornifrons showed strong flower constancy for 4-8 min during one pollen-nectar foraging trip, as observed in honeybees. However, the bees seemed to forage for different types of flowers, e.g. from a red to a white petal color, during their 16-22 pollen-nectar foraging trips based on the S-RNase allele and simple sequence repeat (SSR) analyses of pollen loaves made during those trips. After one pollen-nectar foraging trip, the bees brushed their abdomen with their hind legs at a nester tube, but ca. 10% of pollen was not brushed from their bodies. The remaining pollen on the body retained the ability for the fertilization of apple for 12 days, suggesting that the pollen on the pollinator's body from a pollinizer could be used for the fertilization of a commercial cultivar visited on their next foraging trip. O. cornifrons seems to be a useful pollinator in apple orchards consisting of a single cultivar, such as, 'Fuji', and of pollinizers of different types, such as the red petal color type, 'Maypole' or 'Makamik'. Moreover, most pollen loaves investigated contained S28-RNase allele, which was specific for pollen of 'Starking Delicious' planted at a great distance (55.2 m) from the nestiny shelter, suggesting that O. cornifrons is a useful pollinator for 'Delicious', which is difficult for honeybees to use as a pollinator for its sideworking behavior. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We compared the reproductive success - as measured by progeny production, weight of progeny, developmental rate, and survival of immature stages - of beetles reared on various diets of fruit and bee products. Reproduction on all of the diets was sufficient for population growth. Using baited flight traps to monitor the presence of A. tumida, we found persistent although tenuous populations in wooded habitats lacking managed bee colonies. On the basis of these findings and the habits of other nitidulid beetles, we propose that A. tumida is an ecological generalist able to maintain adequate levels of reproduction in marginal environments but able to reach high levels in favorable, resource rich environments, such as honey bee colonies. This hypothesis has significance for active dispersal and range expansion, because reproduction in the absence of bees would facilitate long range dispersal by flight through successive generations.

However, little is known about how food availability limits bee populations, especially in high elevation areas. Foraging distances and relationships between forager densities and resource availability can provide insights into the potential for food limitation in mobile consumer populations. For example, if floral resources are limited, bee consumers should fly farther to forage, and they should be more abundant in areas with more flowers. I estimated subalpine bumble bee foraging distances by calculating forager recapture probabilities at increasing distances from eight marking locations. I measured forager and flower densities over the flowering season in six half-hectare plots. Because subalpine bumble bees have little time to build their colonies, they may forage over short distances and forager density may not be constrained by flower density. However, late in the season, when floral resources dwindle, foraging distances may increase, and there may be stronger relationships between forager and flower densities. Throughout the flowering season, marked bees were primarily found within 100 m (and never >l, 000 m) from their original marking location, suggesting that they typically did not fly far to forage. Although the density of early season foraging queens increased with early-season flower density, the density of mid- and late-season workers and males did not vary with flower density. Short foraging distances and no relationships between mid- and late-season forager and flower densities suggest that high elevation bumble bees may have ample floral resources for colony growth reproduction. © 2009 Entomological Society of America.",Article,Scopus

Megachilines use resins, masticated leaves, trichomes and other plant materials sometimes along with mud to construct nests in cavities or in soil. Among these, the leafcutter bees (Megachile s.l.) are the most famous for their behaviour to line their brood cells with discs cut from various plants. We report on fossil records of one body fossil of a new non-leafcutting megachiline and of 12 leafcuttings from three European sites-Eckfeld and Messel, both in Germany (Eocene), and Menat, France (Paleocene). The excisions include the currently earliest record of probable Megachile activity and suggest the presence of such bees in the Paleocene European fauna. Comparison with extant leafcuttings permits the interpretation of a minimal number of species that produced these excisions. The wide range of size for the leafcuttings indirectly might suggest at least two species of Megachile for the fauna of Messel in addition to the other megachiline bee described here. The presence of several cuttings on most leaves from Eckfeld implies that the preferential foraging behaviour of extant Megachile arose early in megachiline evolution.

Suitable habitat was found for E. viridissima in various locations throughout southern Florida. This species is predicted to spread to occupy roughly the southern half of the Florida Peninsula. Main conclusions The findings indicate that species distribution modelling is useful for evaluating records of species occurrence outside of their native range. Our results indicate that the isolated record of a male of E. polychroma from southern Arizona should not be considered representative of an established population in the absence of further males and females from the same region. Conversely, E. viridissima has successfully become established in south-eastern Florida after a seemingly accidental introduction first noticed in the summer of 2003. We discuss the naturalization of E. viridissima in Florida, the probability of suitable habitat across the Caribbean (where orchid bees are otherwise natively absent today) and the absence of perfume orchids (Orchidaceae). Lastly, we discuss the implications of these results for understanding the biology and biogeography of Euglossini. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Combining the needs of agricultural production with enhancing biodiversity requires a landscape-scale approach since the geographic scale at which most non-farmed species operate is unconstrained by farm boundaries. Bumblebees are a key component of farmland biodiversity as pollinators of both crops and wild flora. However, the factors determining their densities in such landscapes remain poorly understood. 2. Using a combination of remote-sensed landscape data and molecular markers, we quantify the effects of land use (oilseed rape, field beans and non-cropped areas, all of which provide suitable bumblebee forage), at various spatial scales to find the best predictor of colony density for the bumblebee Bombus pascuorum Scopoli in an arable landscape. 3. Estimated colony density was positively correlated with the area of all habitat categories within 1000 m of the sample site. No significant relationships were found for greater or lesser distances. This concurs with earlier estimates of the foraging range of this species. We found no evidence that nest sizes increased with forage availability, although our data do not allow us to categorically exclude this possibility. 4. It has long been suspected that forage availability limits bee abundance in agricultural landscapes but there is little direct evidence for this. Here we report a direct relationship between floral abundance and bumblebee nest density within a notionally fixed area. Importantly, we suggest that the forage availability within the previously published estimated foraging distance for this species at this location is a good predictor of the scaleof impact of forage provision on nesting density.© 2009 The Royal Entomological Society.",Article,Scopus

We find that there is evidence that some bumblebee species are declining in Europe, North America, and Asia. People believe that land-use changes may be having a negative effect through reductions in food plants in many parts of the world, but that other factors such as pathogens may be having a stronger effect for a few species in some regions (especially for Bombus s. str. in North America). Evidence so far is that greater susceptibility to land-use change is associated world-wide with small climatic ranges, range edges, and late-starting colony-development cycles. More evidence is needed on the roles of pollen specialization, nest sites, hibernation sites, and pesticides. It is still too early to assess the success of schemes aimed at improving forage in agricultural and conservation areas. However, schemes aimed at raising public awareness have been very successful.

Although field studies on bumble-bees and hummingbirds have clarified fundamental aspects of this behaviour, trapline foraging still poses several difficult questions from the perspectives of both animals and plants. These questions include whether and how traplining improves foraging performance, how animals develop traplines with accumulating foraging experience, and how traplining affects pollen flow or plant reproduction. Scope First, we review our previous work performed by using computer simulations and indoor flight-cage experiments with bumble-bees foraging from arrays of automated feeders. Our findings include the following: (1) traplining benefits foragers that are competing for resources that replenish in a decelerating way, (2) traplining is a learned behaviour that develops over a period of hours and (3) the establishment of traplines could be hampered by spatial configuration of plants such as zigzags. Second, using a simulation model linking pollinator movement and pollen transfer, we consider how service by pollinators with different foraging patterns (searchers or trapliners) would affect pollen flow. Traplining increases mating distance and mate diversity, and reduces 'iterogamy' (self-pollination caused by return visits) at the population level. Furthermore, increased visitation rates can have opposite effects on the reproductive success of a plant, depending on whether the visitors are traplining or searching. Finally, we discuss possible consequences of traplining for plants in the light of new experimental work and modelling. Conclusions We suggest that trapline foraging by pollinators increases variation among plant populations in genetic diversity, inbreeding depression and contributions of floral traits to plant fitness, which should in turn affect the rates and directions of floral evolution. More theoretical and empirical studies are needed to clarify possible outcomes of such a neglected side of pollination. © 2009 The Author.",Article,Scopus

Ensuring the maintenance of the service requires a full understanding of the contributions of landscape elements to pollinator populations and crop pollination. Here, the first quantitative model that predicts pollinator abundance on a landscape is described and tested. Methods Using information on pollinator nesting resources, floral resources and foraging distances, the model predicts the relative abundance of pollinators within nesting habitats. From these nesting areas, it then predicts relative abundances of pollinators on the farms requiring pollination services. Model outputs are compared with data from coffee in Costa Rica, watermelon and sunflower in California and watermelon in New Jersey-Pennsylvania (NJPA). Key Results Results from Costa Rica and California, comparing field estimates of pollinator abundance, richness or services with model estimates, are encouraging, explaining up to 80 % of variance among farms. However, the model did not predict observed pollinator abundances on NJPA, so continued model improvement and testing are necessary. The inability of the model to predict pollinator abundances in the NJPA landscape may be due to not accounting for fine-scale floral and nesting resources within the landscapes surrounding farms, rather than the logic of our model. Conclusions The importance of fine-scale resources for pollinator service delivery was supported by sensitivity analyses indicating that the model's predictions depend largely on estimates of nesting and floral resources within crops. Despite the need for more research at the finer-scale, the approach fills an important gap by providing quantitative and mechanistic model from which to evaluate policy decisions and develop land-use plans that promote pollination conservation and service delivery. © 2009 The Author.",Article,Scopus

Yet, whether or not pollinators disperse from semi-natural habitat elements into the adjacent agricultural matrix may to a large extent depend on the quality of this matrix and the corresponding pollinator-specific life history traits. To investigate the effects of matrix quality on the distance decay of wild bees and hoverflies, six transects along vegetated field tracks originating at a large semi-natural main habitat and leading into the adjacent agricultural matrix were established in the Wetterau Region, central Hesse, Germany. Species richness of wild bees did not change with distance from the main habitat in landscapes with sufficient grassland cover in the surrounding landscape, but significantly declined when semi-natural grasslands where scarce and isolated in the adjacent agricultural matrix. Abundance of wild bees declined with distance regardless of matrix quality. Species richness of hoverflies did not decline with increasing distance in any landscape. Abundance even increased with distance to the main habitat independently of matrix quality. Thus, our data show that taxa of the pollinator guild may perceive landscapes quite differently. Because of their differing dispersal modes and resource requirements as compared to wild bees, hoverflies may play an important role in maintaining pollination services in agricultural landscapes unsuitable for bee species. Our results highlight the need for considering these taxon-specific differences when predicting the effect of landscape structure on pollinators. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Article,Scopus

Thus, understanding the reproductive dynamics of scattered tree populations will be critical in determining how they can contribute to population restoration. The distance between conspecifics should be a key predictor of reproductive success, as more isolated trees are expected to receive fewer pollinator visits and experience increased transfer of self-pollen during longer pollinator foraging bouts. Further, isolation effects should be greater in species with less mobile pollinators. Here we contrast the effects of plant isolation on reproductive success of two species of eucalypt ""paddock trees"", Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus leucoxylon, with insect- and bird-pollination, respectively. Seed production was not affected by tree isolation in either the insect- or bird-pollinated species and once outliers were removed, neither was there an effect on germination rate. As somatic mutations may bias outcrossing rate estimates, we initially screened our microsatellite markers for mutations but found no variation in microsatellite profiles throughout the canopy of trees. Individual outcrossing rates did not decline with increasing tree isolation in either the insect- or bird-pollinated species, though there was considerable variation in these rates at large distances, suggesting that pollination becomes unreliable with increasing tree isolation. We found that pollination distances have likely increased in tree species in agricultural landscapes, and that this may be facilitated by introduced honeybees in the case of E. camaldulensis. We therefore suggest that even isolated trees of these species produce seed of sufficient quantity and quality to contribute to population restoration. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Its ability to read and respond to several sets of extrinsic and intrinsic signals is fundamental for the modulation of individual activities and social systems. For instance, A. mellifera behavior changes upon the ontogenetic differentiation from nurse to forager worker subcastes. In this work, brain proteomes of nurses and foragers were compared by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis within pH range of 4-7 in order to find proteins related to such an ontogenetic and behavioral development. Twenty differentially expressed proteins were detected by gel image computational analysis, and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Nurse brain showed increased expression of major royal jelly proteins (MRJP1, MRJP2 and MRJP7), which are related to determination of castes during the honey bee larvae differentiation. Immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy showed that MRJP1 was localized in the cytoplasm of brain cells, seemingly along filaments of the cytoskeleton, in the antennal lobe, optical lobe and mushroom body. Also, MRJP1 was deposited on the rhabdom, a structure ofthe retinular cells, composed ofnumerous tubules. Such evidence suggests that MRJP1 could be associated to proteins of filamentous structures. MRJP1 was also found in intercellular spaces between cells in mushrooms bodies, indicating that it is a secreted protein. Other proteins implicated in protein synthesis and putative functions in the olfactory system were also up- regulated in the nurse brain. Experienced foragers overexpressed proteins possibly involved in energy production, iron binding, metabolic signaling and neurotransmitter metabolism. Such differential expression of proteins may be related to ontogenetic and behavior changes in A. mellifera. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",Article,Scopus

Bumble bees occupy a wide range of habitats from the Nearctic to the Tropics in which they play an important role as pollinators. However, little is known about how a bumble bee colony regulates pollen collection. We manipulated protein quality and colony pollen stores in lab-reared colonies of the native North American bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. We debut evidence that bumble bee colony foraging levels and pollen storage behavior are tuned to the protein quality (range tested: 17-30% protein by dry mass) of pollen collected by foragers and to the amount of stored pollen inside the colony. Pollen foraging levels (number of bees exiting the nest) significantly increased by 55%, and the frequency with which foragers stored pollen in pots significantly increased by 233% for pollen with higher compared to lower protein quality. The number of foragers exiting the nest significantly decreased (by 28%) when we added one pollen load equivalent each 5 min to already high intranidal pollen stores. In addition, pollen odor pumped into the nest is sufficient to increase the number of exiting foragers by 27%. Foragers directly inspected pollen pots at a constant rate over 24 h, presumably to assess pollen levels.

Pollinator movements in watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum & Nakai) were determined by tracking pollen flow with the incompletely dominant lobed-leaf trait of 'Crimson Sweet' (Nl) as the pollen donor and the incompletely recessive 'Sunshade' (nl) as the recipient. Mature 'Sunshade' watermelon fruit were collected at 3-m increments down selected rows and across all rows in both directions from the central donor plants that made up 1% of the planting. The resulting progenies from each fruit collected were screened to determine the directionality of pollinator movements by the occurrence of the Nlnl genotype (or lobed-leaf phenotype). The row that went through the central donor plant block had higher percentages of lobed-leaf seedlings compared with the other rows evaluated. However, lobed-leaf seedlings were observed on rows at significant distances (greater than 10 m) from the donor block. This resulted most likely from long-distance pollen transport, in-hive pollen transfer, or multiple transfers of pollen to staminate (male) and/or pistillate (female) flowers by pollinators before reaching the final destination on a stigmatic surface at a substantial distance from donor plants. Because watermelon vines grow out in all directions, including across rows, a pollinator can easily move to adjacent flowers on a vine growing across rows; thus, the movements of pollinators in watermelon (and most likely other vining cucurbits) are not as simple as maintaining a linear direction down the row.",Article,Scopus

We morphometrically measured 228 specimens of Peponapis pruinosa (Say) collected at 15 sites between Mississippi and Ontario, Canada. Twenty-three landmarks were taken from the right forewings.

The foraging range of bees is thus a fundamental aspect of their ecology, for it determines the area of the habitat that an individual can exploit (Bronstein 1995; Westrich 1996). Understanding the spatial relationship between nest and food resources allows us to make predictions about colony survival and distribution (Nakamura and Toquenaga 2002; Williams and Kremen 2007). Also, if we are to study the effects of habitat management on bee reproduction (i.e., nest success), the appropriate scale of experimental plots depends on the area over which the occupants of each nest forage (whether it is a single bee or a large group of workers). Similarly, if we are to manage habitats to conserve particular bee species, their foraging range inuences the distribution of forage that is considered optimal. For bees to thrive, presumably their nest sites and forage sites must be sufciently close together that they can economically visit the forage. In the case of social species such as bumble bees with a nest that may persist for many months, the nest must be within foraging range of suitable owers throughout its life. Bee foraging ranges are also important in the consideration of insect-mediated crop pollination. The distance a bee ies will determine which elds are visited within the vicinity of the nest, and also the distances over which pollen might be carried to effect gene ow within and between elds (Damgaard et al. 2008). This is particularly relevant when crops are grown for high seed purity, or when genetically modied crops are grown and the transfer of pollen between neighboring fields or farms is undesirable (Rieger et al. 2002; Cresswell et al. 2002; Damgaard and Kjellsson 2005; Weekes et al. 2005). © 2009 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Book Chapter,Scopus

This study examined within- and between-population pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue, and genetic variation and structure using 15 allozyme loci in Centaurium erythraea, an insect-pollinated, early-successional forest biennial herb occurring in a peri-urban forest (Brussels urban zone, Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with most dye transfers occurring at short distances (<15 m), and only a few long-distance events (up to 743 m). Flowers of C. erythraea are mainly visited by Syrphids (Diptera) and small bees, which are usually considered as short-distance pollen dispersers, and occasionally by bumblebees, which are usually longer-distance pollen dispersers. Small and large dye source populations differed in dye deposition patterns. The populations showed low genetic diversity, high inbreeding coefficients (F(IS)) and high genetic differentiation (F(ST)), suggesting restricted gene flow, which can be expected for an early-successional biennial species with a predominantly selfing breeding system and fluctuating population sizes. The positive relationship between recruitment rate and allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, and the absence of significant correlations between genetic variation and population size suggest seedling recruitment from the seed bank, contributing to maintain genetic diversity. Long-distance dye dispersal events indicate pollinator movements along urban forest path and road verges. These landscape elements might therefore have a potential conservation value by contributing to connectivity of early-successional species populations located in patchy open habitats.",Article,Scopus

Linum cratericola (Linaceae) was first discovered in 1966 at two sites on Floreana Island, Galápagos. It has since disappeared from one site and survives in three groups of plants at the other, where it has been threatened with extinction by introduced ungulates and invasive plants. Population size, and growth rate and mortality of individual plants, have been monitored since 1997. The population appears highly responsive to changes in threat levels: the three plant groups increased rapidly following protection by fencing and ungulate control, but temporarily declined when feral goat pressure increased and during dry periods. Natural factors that may contribute to population limitation include dry years, grazing by native snails and competition from native vascular plants and cryptogams. Linum cratericola has a single flowering period per year and produces abundant seed with 28% germination after scarification, but with no obvious adaptations for long-distance dispersal. Potential pollinators included the butterfly Leptotes parrhasioides, the hoverfly Toxomerus crockeri and the carpenter bee Xylocopa darwinii, all endemic to Galápagos.

Of this group, Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata (CCV) is widespread in south-eastern Queensland and northern New South Wales. It is currently the most commonly harvested native hardwood in Queensland. However, little basic knowledge of the reproductive biology of the species is available to inform genetic improvement and resource management programmes. Here we take an integrative approach, using both field and molecular data, to identify ecological factors important to mating patterns in native populations of CCV. Field observation of pollinator visitation and flowering phenology of 20 trees showed that foraging behaviour of pollinator guilds varies depending on flowering phenology and canopy structure. A positive effect of tree mean flowering effort was found on insect visitation, while bat visitation was predicted by tree height and by the number of trees simultaneously bearing flowers. Moreover, introduced honeybees were observed frequently, performing 73% of detected flower visits. Conversely, nectar-feeding birds and mammals were observed sporadically with lorikeets and honeyeaters each contributing to 11% of visits. Fruit bats, represented solely by the grey-headed flying fox, performed less than 2% of visits. Genotyping at six microsatellite markers in 301 seeds from 17 families sampled from four of Queensland’s native forests showed that CCV displays a mixed-mating system that is mostly outcrossing (tm=0.899 ± 0.021). Preferential effective pollination from near-neighbours was detected by means of maximum-likelihood paternity analysis with up to 16% of reproduction events resulting from selfing. Forty to 48% of fertilising pollen was also carried from longer distance (&gt;60 m). Marked differences in foraging behaviour and visitation frequency between observed pollinator guilds suggests that the observed dichotomy of effective pollen movement in spotted gums may be due to frequent visit from introduced honeybees favouring geitonogamy and sporadic visits from honeyeaters and fruit bats resulting in potential long-distance pollinations. © NISC Pty Ltd.",Article,Scopus

We examined mean thorax widths (a reliable measure of body size) of workers of Bombus pascuorum, B. lucorum, B. lapidarius and B. terrestris at sites with and without honeybees. Workers of all four species were significantly smaller in areas with honeybees. We suggest that reduced worker size is likely to have implications for bumblebee colony success.

We conducted observations in eight reused nests (where a first generation of bees had been produced) kept in artificial boxes from the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Five nests were reused (reactivated) by a single female (SFN), two nests reused by a mother and one daughter (MFN1) and one nest reused by the mother and two daughters (MFN2). No single nest was reactivated by unrelated females. The number of foraging trips, their duration and the duration of cell provisioning was not different between SFN and MFN. The overall production of cells per female was not different either between both types of nest. However, in MFN although all females did lay eggs, there was a reproductive skew in favor of the mother (95 and 45% of the brood produced in MFN1 and MFN2 respectively). She showed reproductive control of her daughters through oophagy and displaying threatening behavior when the daughters tried to open a cell where she had laid an egg. Brood losses to parasites (Anthrax sp. (Bom-byliidae) and Hoplostelis bivittata (Megachilidae)) were only found in SFN which possibly reflects and advantage of MFN in this respect. Our results coupled with other studies in Euglossa, reveal that a wide range of social behaviors occur in this genus, from solitary and communal to primitive reproductive division of labor. Multiple factors involving different levels of pressure imposed by food availability and parasites may favor such a diverse range of nesting behaviors. Interestingly, female associations in E. viridissima seem a result of kin selection that is enforced by coercion from mother females on their daughters. More studies are needed to shed light upon the social organization of Euglossa and other Euglossines and on their phylogenetic relationships in order to trace the origins of eusociality in Apidae. © 2008 Birkhaeuser.",Article,Scopus

Here we measured the effects of the nectar-robbing bumblebees on male (measured as pollen analogue flow distance) and female (measured as seed production) reproductive success in the insect-dependent Polygala vayredae, a narrow endemic species from the pre-Pyrenees (Spain). Intense nectar robbing by bumblebees significantly reduced the nectar available to legitimate pollinators in the studied population, and this reduction affected both male and female fitness. Significant differences were observed in fluorescent dye dispersion between robbed and non-robbed flowers within the population. Fluorescent dyes from non-robbed flowers were dispersed to larger distances and over a larger number of flowers when compared with robbed ones. Moreover, significant differences were observed in both fruit set and seed ovule ratios between the two groups, with non-robbed flowers presenting higher reproductive outcomes. However, no effect on seed weight was detected among treatments.

To explore the potential role that secondary metabolites play in pollination, we studied the pollination systems of five Diplomorpha species in Japan by investigating their floral morphology and flower-visiting insect fauna. We also analyzed the composition and temporal emission pattern of floral volatiles in one of the species to determine if there were any characteristics associated with the observed flower visitors. In Diplomorpha, anthesis began at dusk and various nocturnal moths were found visiting the flowers, often carrying numerous pollen grains on their proboscises. However, no hawkmoths were observed visiting Diplomorpha flowers. Diurnal insects visited the flowers less often, and most of them had short mouthparts and did not effectively contact the stigma. The floral scent of Diplomorpha sikokiana was released only at night when the moths were active and consisted mainly of monoterpenes and benzenoids, with a small amount of a sesquiterpene. The present study is the first to examine the pollination system of Diplomorpha and suggests that these plants exhibit a range of floral features associated with pollination by nocturnal moths. The single ovule in Diplomorpha flowers probably does not favor pollination by optimally foraging bees, which are more likely to cause intraplant pollen transfer, and might have facilitated adaptation to pollination by nocturnal moths, despite the lower number of pollen grains that are carried by these insects. © 2008 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

First, I argue that experimental preparations based on binary, mutually exclusive choice are not good models of foraging decisions. Instead, foraging choices have a sequential foreground-background structure, in which one option is in the background of all other options. Second, behavioral ecologists view foraging as a hierarchy of decisions that range from habitat selection to food choice. Finally, data suggest that foraging animals are sensitive to several important trade-offs.

Generally, the predicted level of gene flow was found to depend on the visiting bee species and the spatial arrangement of the red clover fields. When the fields are close to each other, the gene flow depends mainly on the typical foraging distance of the visiting bee species, but when the fields are far apart, the gene flow between red clover fields is more sensitive to the distances between red clover fields than to the actual bumblebee species that pollinates the fields. Using the suggested methodology, the gene flow may be predicted in different agricultural scenarios. For example, if the gene flow between red clover fields is mediated by Bombus terrestris and the red clover fields that were assumed to be quadrates with sides of 100 m are separated by 200 m, then the median gene flow is predicted to be 0.17%. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Article,Scopus

In this study we manipulate the amount of celestial compass information available to the bee during flight, and analyse the encoding of spatial information in the waggle dance as well as in the navigation of the foraging bee. We find that the waggle dance encodes information about the total distance flown to the food source, even when celestial compass cues are available only for a part of the journey. This stands in contrast to how a bee gauges distance flown when it navigates back to a food source that it already knows. When bees were trained to find a feeder placed at a fixed distance in a tunnel in which celestial cues were partially occluded and then tested in a tunnel that was fully open to the sky, they searched for the feeder at a distance that corresponds closely to the distance that was flown under the open sky during the training. Thus, when navigating back to a food source, information about distance travelled is disregarded when there is no concurrent input from the celestial compass. We suggest that bees may possess two different odometers - a 'community' odometer that is used to provide information to nestmates via the dance, and a 'personal' odometer that is used by an experienced individual to return to a previously visited source.",Article,Scopus

Our simulation indicated that the most successful forages were made by a putative bee colony that used the dance to communicate. Video analysis of worker honeybee behavior in the field showed that a bee does not dance in a single, random place in the hive, but waggles several times in one place and several times in another. The orientation and duration of waggle runs varied from run to run, within ranges of ±15° and ±15%, respectively. We also found that most of the bees that listened to the waggle dance turned away from the dancer after listening to one or two runs.

Indeed, the concept of a 'landmark' is itself not entirely clear. In everyday language, the term landmark refers to salient, distinguishable, and usually nameable objects, rendering the problem of landmark recognition a special case of the general object recognition problem. In contrast, in the insect and robot literature, this notion of landmarks is often replaced by the ""local position information"" [e.g., Trullier, O., Wiener, S., Berthoz, A., & Meyer, J.-A. (1997). Biologically based artificial navigation systems: Review and prospects. Progress in Neurobiology, 51, 483-544], referring to the entire set of sensor readings obtained at one location. This set may then serve as a characteristic of the particular location. Honey bees have been shown to base place recognition and homing on a snapshot-like memory of the place's visual environment, not on the distances to recognized objects [Cartwright, B., & Collett, T. (1983). Landmark learning in bees. Experiments and models. Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 151, 521-543]. A number of theoretical models of snapshot-based homing [e.g., Franz, M., Schölkopf, B., Mallot, H. A., Bülthoff, H. H. (1998). Where did I take that snapshot? Scene-based homing by image matching. Biological Cybernetics, 79, 191-202; Vardy, A., & Möller, R. (2005). Biologically plausible visual homing methods based on optical flow techniques. Connection Science, 17, 47-89] predict that the accuracy of snapshot-based homing should depend on image contrast. For rodent hippocampal place fields, models have been developed using additional image information such as three-dimensional depth and allocentric orientations (e.g., room axes) and are thus less sensitive to image contrast and noise [e.g. Barry, C., Lever, C., Hayman, R., Hartley, T., Burton, S., O'Keefe, J., et al. (2006). The boundary vector cell model of place cell firing and spatial memory. Reviews in the Neurosciences, 17, 71-79]. Here, we study human visual homing in a virtual environment void of objects and readily detected image features. The environment was a circular room with a homogenous colour gradient covering the wall and uniform floor and ceiling. Subjects were able to approach remembered places. Accuracy decreased with colour gradient modulation and room size, in qualitative agreement with the snapshot model but not with other models of place recognition. We conclude that human memory for places can make use of a snapshot algorithm. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

Most animal-pollinated flowering plants offer nectar as a reward for their pollinators. Some 20 000 species, however, offer only pollen and rely on pollen-foraging bees for pollination. This creates a dilemma since pollen grains contain the male gametes and should be protected from becoming bee food. Darwin was the first to hypothesize that a 'division-of-labour' among stamens could solve this dilemma, with some stamens providing pollen as food, others providing pollen for fertilization. This hypothesis can only be tested if pollen grains from the two sets of stamens can be distinguished and their fates determined to the point of attachment on the stigma. 2. We tested Darwin's hypothesis in Melastoma malabathricum (Melastomataceae), a pollen-only flower with conspicuously differentiated stamens, an inner set that is short and yellow and an outer set that is much longer and purple with small yellow spurs. Pollen release is through terminal anther pores. Taking advantage of different exine patterns on the pollen produced by the two sets of stamens, we carried out a series of experimental manipulations to compare pollinator foraging behaviour and pollen pathways from anthers to stigmas. 3. The results demonstrate that in spite of all 10 stamens being buzzed simultaneously by the carpenter bees that pollinate M. malabathricum, pollen from the purple 'fertilization' stamens is dramatically more likely to land on stigmas than pollen from the yellow 'feeding' stamens. Removal experiments showed that the yellow 'feeding' stamens also attracted pollinators from a distance. Flowers that had their anther pores plugged received fewer buzzing bouts per visit, indicating that bees assessed the amount of pollen received per bout. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in pollen loads on stigmas of flowers that had their anthers plugged and stigmas of controls, demonstrating the efficiency of vector-assisted cross-pollination and the lack of vector-assisted self-pollination. 4. The unexpectedly precise placement of pollen grains even with buzz pollination, with a large proportion of the grains deposited out of the bees' grooming reach, helps explain the evolutionary persistence of pollen as a reward in spite of the bees' ability to assess the amount of pollen received during foraging bouts. Together, these results strongly support Darwin's division-of-labour hypothesis. © 2008 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

Nature reserves are not included. The aim of this study was to investigate whether maize pollen of surrounding fields were dispersed in the Flora-Fauna-Habitat (FFH) Ruhlsdorfer Bruch. In the vicinity of the nature reserve Bt-maize species MON 810 as well as conventional maize was grown. The survey should provide appropriate isolation distances for the cultivation of Bt-maize with regard to sustainable protection of non-target-organisms (NTO) in the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch. Materials and Methods: The collection of maize pollen in the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch was carried out at three sampling sites in the FFH or rather in the immediate vicinity in July and August 2007 by means of twelve technical and three biological pollen samplers. The technical samplers Sigma-2/PMF enable point sampling. They are primarily influenced by wind and topography and provide information about the effective entry, the maize pollen flow and the maize pollen deposition at the location of the sampler. Honey bees roam over longer distances and are hence planar collectors. Thus, they also provide information about the plants blooming in a distinct area. Furthermore, the biological preferences during the collection are captured, whereas a technical sampler does not perform a species dependent selection. Hence, both the technical and the biological samplers complement one another in their scope of application. The pollen samples were identified microscopically, enumerated quantitatively, and the pollen-DNA was analysed by means of the PCR-method. Results: All monitoring sites at the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch revealed maize pollen entries. The pollen deposition reached values of 1.75 million maize pollen/m2 in the close-up range. The monitoring sites located 120 m within the protected area still featured 99,000 maize pollen/m2. As shown by the statistical analysis, at a distance of 1,000 m still 28,000 maize pollen/m2 must be expected. The results of the microscopic pollen analysis of the pollen pellets proved that the bees collect maize pollen at all three sites. Although maize pollen is not the main food source the high collection efficiency of the bees resulted in large amounts of introduced pollen. The biomolecular proof of pollen-DNA in the field samples was corroborated by analogue results for both the technical and biological pollen sampling by two independent laboratories. The results of these quality controlled analyses gave unambiguous evidence that under the cultivation conditions in 2007 an entry of Bt-maize pollen into the FFH Ruhlsdorfer Bruch was existent. Discussion: The maize pollen deposition at the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch corresponds with additional supra-regional investigations which were conducted over several years with the same method. However, the pollen entries into the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch are above-average. Possible reasons are the size of the maize fields (&gt; 10 ha), the geographical collocation between maize fields and protected area (lee location, through-shaped, thermal currents) as well as weather conditions and maize bloom during the sampling period July and August 2007. A distance of 1,000 m or more is necessary to avoid maize pollen deposition of more than 100,000/m2 with a probability of 90%. Conclusions: The results of this investigation prove an entry of Bt-maize pollen into the FFH under the cultivation and weather conditions in summer 2007. According to the results of this and related studies and considering precautionary principle and the effect terms defined in the Federal Immission Protection Law, it becomes clear that reasonable isolation distances between Bt-maize fields and protected areas have to be introduced in order to minimise the entry of GM-maize pollen and to prevent adverse effects on protected NTOs. Recommendations: Due to the fact that no toxicological investigations are available for the butterflies occurring in the FFH, highest protection standards should be implemented to avoid Bt-maize pollen entries into the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch. That implies that highest possible isolation distances for Bt-maize cultivation have to be considered, but at least a distance of 1,000 m is recommended. Following this a maize pollen deposition of more than 100,000 maize pollen/m2 should be pevented with a certainty of 90% as well as an exceeding exposure of foraging insects. Outlook: By means of the pollen monitoring it becomes possible to survey empirically defined limits of pollen exposure. This should be performed in the nature reserve area at sites of expected maximum exposure, e.g. at the boundaries of the FFH towards the maize fields and at exposed sites. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",Article,Scopus

This waggle dance is used by successful foragers to convey information about both the direction and distance to food sources. Nest mates can use this spatial information, increasing their chances of locating the food source. But how effective is the bees' dance communication? Previous work has shown that dancing does not benefit a honeybee colony under all foraging conditions and that the benefits of dancing are small. We used an individual-based simulation model to investigate under which foraging conditions it pays to dance. We compared the net nectar intake of 3 types of colonies: 1) colonies that use dance communication; 2) colonies that did dance but could not use the dance's spatial information; and 3) colonies that did not dance. Our results show that dancing is beneficial when the probability of independent discovery of food sources is low. Low independent discovery rates occur when patches are very small or very far away. Under these conditions, dancing is beneficial as only a single individual needs to find a patch for the whole colony to benefit. The main benefit of the honeybee's dance communication, however, seems to be that it enables the colony to forage at the most profitable patches only, ignoring forage patches that are of low quality. Thus, dancing allows the colony to rapidly exploit high-quality patches, thereby preventing both intra- and interspecific competitors from using that same patch. © The Author 2007.

Some colours generated by hybridization were not observed in any Antirrhinum species and even appeared to be rare among angiosperms. Variation in flower colours within the hybrid zone was continuous; the most similar colours were predicted not to be discriminated from one another in natural foraging situations. However, when compared at a scale corresponding to bees' foraging range, some flower colours could be discriminated from all colours displayed by neighbouring plants. This could affect pollinator behaviour and explain lower visitation rates within the centre of the hybrid zone.

However, long-distance pollen flow is difficult to assess, especially when the plant also relies on self-pollination. Pollen movement can be estimated indirectly through population genetic data, but complementary data on pollinator flight distances is necessary to validate such estimates. By using radio-tracking of cowpea pollinator return flights, we found that carpenter bees visiting cowpea flowers can forage up to 6 km from their nest. Foraging distances were found to be shorter than the maximum flight range, especially under adverse weather conditions or poor reward levels. From complete flight records in which bees visited wild and domesticated populations, we conclude that bees can mediate gene flow and, in some instances, allow transgene (genetically engineered material) escape over several kilometers.

These experiments are the first to examine directly the impact of honey bee, Apis mellifera, nest invaders on plant pollination and fitness. A cost to pollination could occur under two scenarios: (1) at the colony level where nest invaders compromise the health of the foraging cohort and reduce their efficacy as pollinators or (2) at the community level where invaders simply kill bee colonies and reduce the local pollinator population. Honey bee colonies were manipulated to achieve different levels of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor or nest-invading beetle Aethina tumida and tented under one of two model plants: canola (Brassica napus) or rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei). On the basis of single-bee flower visits, fruit-set was reduced in blueberry with bees from varroa-parasitized colonies. However, on the basis of colonies, there were no differences in blueberry fruit-set, number of blueberry pollen tetrads deposited on the stigma, and pod-set in canola among colonies with different levels of nest invaders or no-invader controls. Thus, within the range of nest invader densities used in this study, individual inefficiencies were erased by compensatory multiple flower visits by this colonial pollinator. By failing to affirm the functionality of scenario (1) this study indirectly supports scenario (2): the major contribution of honey bee nest invaders toward a pollinator deficit is the simple eradication of colonies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Maximising individual work effort is limited by the physical constraints on foraging outside the nest. Previous studies of factors influencing activity in social insects suggest that light intensity, ground and air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and/or rainfall may be important. This study aimed to determine which environmental factors influence foraging in an invasive social insect, Vespula germanica, which has been introduced to Australia, where it experiences a hotter and drier climate than in its native range. Activity was measured in terms of foraging traffic, with nests from a range of locations being monitored. Results indicate that the onset of rain reduces activity by approximately 30%, but foraging returns to previous levels immediately after rain stops. Foraging time is correlated with duration of daylight, with wasp daily activity being on average 22 min longer than the time between sunrise and sunset. Low light was found to restrict wasp activity, as were low and high temperatures. A linear mixed-effects model developed to explain the influence of these variables on numbers of foragers was highly significant. Under hot conditions, V. germanica individuals thermoregulate their body temperature by regurgitating water. They also use water in evaporative cooling to keep nests at optimum temperatures. Thus, in this species, hot temperatures increase the need for water, and so populations may be severely impacted in seasonally hot regions where water is limited. © 2008 Birkhaeuser.",Article,Scopus

However, little is known about their effects on gene flow via pollen dispersal between populations of these species. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a 2-year experiment, we observed effective pollen dispersal from source populations of Centaurea jacea in restored meadows, the most widespread Swiss agri-environment scheme, to potted plants in adjacent intensively managed meadows without other individuals of this species. Potted plants were put in replicated source populations at 25, 50, 100 m and where possible 200 m distance from these source populations. Pollen transfer among isolated plants was prevented by temporary bagging, such that only one isolated plant was accessible for flower visitors at any one time. Because C. jacea is self-incompatible, seed set in single-plant isolates indicated insect mediated effective pollen dispersal from the source population. Seed set was higher in source populations (35.7±4.4) than in isolates (4.8±1.0). Seed set declined from 18.9% of that in source populations at a distance of 25 m to 7.4% at 200 m. At a distance of 200 m seed set was still significantly higher in selfed plants, indicating long-distance effective pollen dispersal up to 200 m. Analyses of covariance suggested that bees contributed more than flies to this long-distance pollen dispersal. We found evidence that pollen dispersal to single-plant isolates was positively affected by the diversity and flower abundance of neighboring plant species in the intensively managed meadow. Furthermore, the decline of the dispersal was less steep when the source population of C. jacea was large. Conclusions: We conclude that insect pollinators can effectively transfer pollen from source populations of C. jacea over at least 200 m, even when ""recipient populations"" consisted of single-plant isolates, suggesting that gene flow by pollen over this distance is very likely. Source population size and flowering environment surrounding recipient plants appear to be important factors affecting pollen dispersal in C. jacea. It is conceivable that most insect-pollinated plants in a network of restored sites within intensively managed grassland can form metapopulations, if distances between sites are of similar magnitude as tested here. © 2009 Albrecht et al.",Article,Scopus

Following the principle of a case-by-case for transgenic crop safety assessment, we designed experiments to study pollen-mediated gene flow from herbicide-resistant transgenic oilseed rape to Chinese commercial varieties. The pollen dispersal was detected as the progeny of recipient plants that were identified as glufosinate resistant. The results indicated that pollen dispersal occurred up to 2000 m and its rate sharply decreased as the distance from the pollen source increased. However, the rate of long-distance pollen dispersal from 33 to 2000 m was less than 0.015% and did not present a gradual decrease, indicating the randomization of dispersal and pollination. Most pollen dispersed within a 4.5 m area around the transgenic pollen source plot, with a maximum of 1.19% at the sampling site of 1.4 m. Wind direction significantly affected the direction and the distance of pollen dispersal, resulting in the more and farther dispersal in southwest direction. However, the number of potentially pollinating bees was not correlated with direction and distance from the pollen source plot, suggesting that bee density and distribution would not contribute to the differences in pollen dispersal among different directions.

Foragers significantly elevated their Tth over ambient air temperature while collecting pollen and maintained this elevated Tth upon returning to the nest.

Flight behaviour was measured in three dimensions as total flying distance, mean velocity, variability of velocity, maximum acceleration, maximum deceleration, percentage of time spent accelerating, and displacement from a straight line path between flowers. Loss of wing area had surprisingly little effect on flight behaviour. Viewed multivariately, bees with low asymmetry and low loss of mean area, or with high asymmetry and high loss of mean area, differed from the other three treatment groups. When bees were burdened with both high asymmetry and high loss of wing area, their between-flower flight path was less direct.

When species have become rare such studies are complicated because particular behavior or life history traits may be the cause but also the result of the decline of a species. We approached this problem by studying species' characteristics on specimens that were collected before the onset of their decline and preserved in natural history museums. In northwestern Europe, some bumble bee species declined dramatically during the 20th century whereas other, ecologically similar, species maintained stable populations. A long-standing debate focuses on whether this is caused by declining species having stricter host plant preferences. We compared the composition of pollen loads of five bumble bee species with stable populations and five with declining populations using museum specimens collected before 1950 in Belgium, England, and The Netherlands. Prior to 1950, the number of plant taxa in pollen loads of declining species was almost one-third lower than that in stable species even though individuals of stable and declining species generally originated from the same areas. There were no systematic differences in the composition of pollen loads between stable and declining species, but the plant taxa preferred by declining species before 1950 had experienced a stronger decline in the 20th century than those preferred by stable species. In 2004 and 2005, we surveyed the areas where bumble bees had been caught in the past and compared the composition of past and present pollen loads of the stable, but not of the by now locally extinct declining species. The number of collected pollen taxa was similar, but the composition differed significantly between the two periods. Differences in composition reflected the major changes in land use in northwestern Europe but also the spread of the invasive plant species Impatiens glandulifera.

Here, we show that foundress associations in the haplodiploid social thrips Dunatothrips aneurae (Insecta: Thysanoptera) are most often comprised of close relatives (sisters), though groups with unrelated foundresses are also found. Associations among relatives appear to be facilitated by limited female dispersal, which results in viscous population structure. In addition, we found that per capita productivity declined with increasing group size, sex ratios were female-biased, and some female offspring apparently remained in their natal domicile for some time following eclosion. D. aneurae thus exhibits a suite of similarities with eusocial Hymenoptera, providing evidence for the convergent evolution of associated social and life-history traits in Hymenoptera and Thysanoptera. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

To determine the detailed biological features of the waggle dance, we observed worker honeybee behavior in the field. Video analysis showed that the bee does not dance in a single or random place in the hive but waggled several times in one place and then several times in another.

Angle and duration of waggle runs varied from run to run, with the range of ±15° and ±15%, respectively, even in a series of waggle dances of a single individual.

When in particular experimental paradigms the two types of information - vector-based and landmark-based information - are made to compete with each other, the insect may weight either source more heavily depending on the navigational context and the animal's motivational state. Here we studied the effects of a displaced nest mark on the homing performances of Cataglyphis ants. Foragers were trained to shuttle between the nest, which was marked by a black cylinder (the beacon), and an artificial feeder. Trained ants were captured at the feeder and transferred to a distant test field, where they experienced the nest mark at various positions relative to their home vector. When the beacon was positioned to one side of the point of release, the ants slightly drifted towards the beacon right at the start of their inbound run, but thereafter resumed their home-vector courses. When the nest mark appeared to one side further down the homing course, the ants set off in the home-vector direction, but then gradually drifted towards the beacon. The distance, at which this occurred, and the ants' drift from the home-vector course were very similar across test conditions. During the final search for the nest, landmark information dominated the ants' path integrator.

Despite ongoing concerns and controversy over a putative 'global pollination crisis' there is little information on the response of bees, the most important group of pollinators, to land-use change. In particular, there are no published studies of the effects of tropical forest fragmentation on entire bee communities. 2. We examined bee community responses to forest fragment size, shape, isolation and landscape context (forest variables) by sampling foraging bees at ground level using aerial netting within, and in pastures adjacent to, 22 forest fragments ranging in area from c. 0.25 ha to 230 ha, in southern Costa Rica. We sampled each site 13 times in total, in both wet and dry seasons. 3. Although there were no effects of forest variables on bee diversity and abundance, we did find strong changes in bee community composition. In particular, tree-nesting meliponines (social stingless bees) were associated with larger fragments, smaller edge:area ratios and greater proportions of forest surrounding sample points, while introduced Apis showed opposite patterns. 4. Community composition was also strikingly different between forests and pastures, despite their spatial proximity. In forests, even in the smallest patches, meliponines comprised a much larger proportion of the apifauna, and orchid bees (euglossines) were common. In pastures, Apis was much more abundant and no euglossine bees were found. 5. These results agree broadly with other studies that have found contrasting responses to habitat fragmentation from different bee groups. Conserving meliponine bees, important for pollination of coffee and other crops, and euglossine bees, critical in long-distance pollen transport, will require forest. 6. Synthesis and applications. In the first study of the effects of tropical forest fragmentation on entire understorey bee assemblages, we found bee community resilience to land-use change, as deforested sites and small forest fragments can have a diverse component of bees. While bees as a whole show some degree of resilience to land-use change, there are taxon-specific responses and, in our study area, there is clear value to conserving native forest, particularly for the ecologically and economically important meliponine and euglossine bees. © 2007 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

Over the last decades, biodiversity in agricultural landscapes has declined drastically. Initiatives to enhance biodiversity, such as agri-environment schemes, often have little effect, especially in intensively farmed landscapes. The effectiveness of conservation management may be improved by scheme implementation near high-quality habitats that can act as a source of species. We evaluated up to what distance high-quality habitats (nature reserves and artificially created flower-rich patches) affect the diversity of forbs and pollinators in intensively farmed landscapes of the Netherlands. 2. We surveyed forbs, inflorescences, bees and hover flies and estimated pollination services in transects along ditch banks extending 300 m from four nature reserves forming small islands in landscapes dominated by agriculture. 3. In a separate experiment, we surveyed inflorescences, bees and hover flies in 1500 m long transects on farmland adjacent to five newly introduced flower-rich patches and in five control transects. 4. Species density of forbs declined over the first 75 m and species density and abundance of hover flies declined over the first 125 m beyond the nature reserves. Beyond these distances, no further declines were observed. The effects of flower-rich patches were spatially limited. The species density and abundance of bees and hover flies were significantly enhanced in the flower-rich patch, but only the abundance of hover flies was enhanced up to 50 m beyond the patch. 5. Synthesis and applications. In intensively farmed areas, remnant high-quality habitats sustain more abundant and diverse pollinator and forb communities than the surrounding countryside. They do enhance biodiversity on nearby farmland but increases are spatially restricted (< 150 m) and relatively small. These habitats may therefore function only as dispersal sources for ecological restoration sites or agricultural fields under extensification schemes that are located in close proximity. Habitat restoration in intensively used farmland should therefore be implemented preferentially in the immediate vicinity of high-quality habitats. In the short term, newly created flower-rich habitats are no alternative to pre-existing seminatural habitats for the promotion of pollinators on nearby farmland. © 2007 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

It conveys to bees and human observers the position of a relatively small area at the endpoint of an average vector in a two-dimensional system of coordinates. This vector is often computed from a collection of waggle phases from the same or different dancers. The question remains, however, of how informative a small sample of waggle phases can be to the bees, and how the spatial information encoded in the dance is actually mapped to the followers' searches in the field. Certainly, it is the variability of a dancer's performance that initially defines the level of uncertainty that followers must cope with if they were to successfully decode information in the dance. Understanding how a dancer's behaviour is mapped to that of its followers initially relies on the analysis of both the accuracy and precision with which the dancer encodes spatial information in the dance. Here we describe within-individual variations in the encoding of the distance to and direction of a goal. We show that variations in the number of a dancer's wagging movements, a measure that correlates well with the distance to the goal, do not depend upon the dancer's travelled distance, meaning that there is a constant variance of wagging movements around the mean. We also show that the duration of the waggle phases and the angular dispersion and divergence of successive waggle phases co-vary with a dancer's orientation in space. Finally, using data from dances recorded through high-speed video techniques, we present the first analysis of the accuracy and precision with which an increasing number of waggle phases conveys spatial information to a human observer.",Article,Scopus

The advantage of large inflorescences in terms of attractiveness was larger for racemes and umbels than for panicles, whereas the effect of inter-inflorescence distance on the number of successive probes was smaller for racemes than for panicles and umbels. The number of flowers probed per visit increased almost proportionally with display size when fewer flowers were empty, whereas the number increased less when many flowers were empty.

Despite this interest, their function is not well understood. We test the hypothesis that multimodal signals improve decision making in receivers by influencing the speed and the accuracy of their decisions. We trained bumble-bees (Bombus impatiens) to discriminate between artificial flowers that differed either in one modality, visual (specifically, shape) or olfactory, or in two modalities, visual plus olfactory. Bees trained on multimodal flowers learned the rewarding flowers faster than those trained on flowers that differed only in the visual modality and, in extinction trials, visited the previously rewarded flowers at a higher rate than bees trained on unimodal flowers. Overall, bees showed a speed-accuracy trade-off; bees that made slower decisions achieved higher accuracy levels. Foraging on multimodal flowers did not affect the slope of the speed-accuracy relationship, but resulted in a higher intercept, indicating that multimodal signals were associated with consistently higher accuracy across range of decision speeds. Our results suggest that bees make more effective decisions when flowers signal in more than one modality, and confirm the importance of studying signal components together rather than separately. © 2008 The Royal Society.",Article,Scopus

Post Pleistocene movements of most plants and animals into the region have generally followed East and North Greenland coastal routes, and the majority of the plants have North American affinities. Climatic change, bringing about reduction in the extent of sea ice adjacent to the coast and changes in seasonality and associated precipitation and air movements, influences patterns of activity, growth, reproduction, and dispersal of all life forms present. Climate-associated changes in the biotic communities of the region are altering inter-species interactions, notably pollination, seed dispersal and plant-herbivore relations. Sexual reproduction and dispersal of propagules, primarily seeds, are essential processes underlying maintenance of genetic diversity in plant communities in Northeast Greenland. Wind and water transport of seeds are primary methods by which plants disperse and become established in the High Arctic, particularly at shorter distances. Birds and mammals are also involved and may be of particular significance to long-distance seed dispersal. In Northeast Greenland, dispersal of viable seeds may frequently occur by passage through the guts of geese and musk oxen. Research at Zackenberg on the role of insects in pollination of flowering plants has shown that Diptera species, primarily flies, dominate among the insect species visiting flowers each summer. Diptera, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Hymenoptera (bumble bees and small wasps), and one Hemiptera (true bugs) species have constituted the primary pollinators at Zackenberg. Arctic willow Salix arctica, white arctic bell heather Cassiope tetragona, and mountain avens Dryas octopetala are the primary species represented in the pollen present on pollinating insects at Zackenberg. The effects of climate warming that may enhance environmental conditions for plant growth in Northeast Greenland and accelerate invasion of new species will also be tied to the relationship of specific plant species to their insect pollinators. Those plants that are self-pollinated may have an initial advantage in an environment where insects and their plant relationships are being altered by the changing climate. An increase in growth and dispersal of shrubs in the Arctic is occurring as a consequence of climate warming. Increases in shrubs with more upright growth form, especially willows, will generate microhabitats not previously present in the High Arctic. The new habitats will make possible the invasion of new insect, mammal, and bird herbivores, as well as their parasites and predators. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Review,Scopus

The view that honeybees have two discrete recruitment dances has been widely accepted since its inception in the 1920s. However, there are few detailed examinations of the behavioural parameters of dances over the range of food-source distances represented by round dances and waggle dances.

Recent research clarified properties of several signals and cues used by stingless bees when exploiting food sources. Thus, the main source of the trail pheromone in Trigona are the labial, not however the mandibular glands. In T. recursa and T. spinipes, the first stingless bee trail pheromones were identified as hexyl decanoate and octyl decanoate, respectively. The attractant footprints left by foragers at the food source are secreted by glandular epithelia of the claw retractor tendon, not however by the tarsal gland. Regarding intranidal communication, the correlation between a forager's jostling rate and recruitment success stresses the importance of agitated running and jostling. There is no evidence for a ""dance"" indicating food source location, however, whereas the jostling rate depends on food quality. Thoracic vibrations, another intranidal signal well known in Melipona, were analyzed using modern technology and distinguishing substrate vibrations from airborne sound.

In the present study, honeybees were provided with differential conditioning to images of complex natural scenes, in order to determine if they could reliably learn to discriminate between very similar scenes, and to recognise a learnt scene from a novel distractor scene.

In a non-rewarded transfer test bees were also able to recognise target stimuli from novel distractors.

When foraging, all species face an identical problem: conveying information about profitable floral patches. However, profound differences in nesting biology (some nest in cavities while others nest in the open, often on a branch or a cliff face) may mean that species have different requirements when dancing to advertise new nest sites. In cavity nesting species, nest sites are a precise location in the landscape: usually a small opening leading to a cavity in a hollow tree. Dances for cavities therefore need to be as precise as possible. In contrast, when the potential nest site comprises a tree or perhaps seven a patch of trees, precision is less necessary. Similarly, when a food patch is advertised, dances need not be very precise, as floral patches are often large, unless they are so far away that recruits need more precise information to be able to locate them. In this paper, we study the dance precision of the open-nesting red dwarf bee Apis florea. By comparing the precision of dances for food sources and nest sites, we show that A. florea workers dance with the same imprecision irrespective of context. This is in sharp contrast with the cavity-nesting Apis mellifera that increases the precision of its dance when advertising a potential new home.

There were considerable niche overlaps in flower resource use between B. terrestris and B. hypocrita sapporoensis/B. pseudobaicalensis. Bombus terrestris also potentially competes for nest sites with B. hypocrita sapporoensis. During 3-year monitoring, B. pseudobaicalensis showed no noticeable change, but B. hypocrita sapporoensis decreased while B. terrestris increased. Abundant flower resources provided by exotic plants may buffer native bumblebees from competition for food with introduced species. By contrast, the number of nest usurpers found in B. terrestris nests increased between 2003 and 2005, indicating that availability of nest sites was limiting and queens strongly competed for nest sites. Our findings suggest that competition for nest sites rather than flower resources is the major ecological mechanism for displacement of native bees.

Foraging range is a key aspect of the ecology of 'central place foragers'. Estimating how far bees fly under different circumstances is essential for predicting colony success, and for estimating bee-mediated gene flow between plant populations. It is likely to be strongly influenced by forage distribution, something that is hard to quantify in all but the simplest landscapes; and theories of foraging distance tend to assume a homogeneous forage distribution. 2. We quantified the distribution of bumblebee Bombus terrestris L. foragers away from experimentally positioned colonies, in an agricultural landscape, using two methods. We mass-marked foragers as they left the colony, and analysed pollen from foragers returning to the colonies. The data were set within the context of the 'forage landscape': a map of the spatial distribution of forage as determined from remote-sensed data. To our knowledge, this is the first time that empirical data on foraging distances and forage availability, at this resolution and scale, have been collected and combined for bumblebees. 3. The bees foraged at least 1.5 km from their colonies, and the proportion of foragers flying to one field declined, approximately linearly, with radial distance. In this landscape there was great variation in forage availability within 500 m of colonies but little variation beyond 1 km, regardless of colony location. 4. The scale of B. terrestris foraging was large enough to buffer against effects of forage patch and flowering crop heterogeneity, but bee species with shorter foraging ranges may experience highly variable colony success according to location. © 2007 Rothamsted Research.",Article,Scopus

The temporal pattern of these vibrations correlates with the sugar concentration of the collected food. One possible pathway for transfering such information to nestmates is through airborne sound. In the present study, we investigated the transformation of thoracic vibrations into air particle velocity, sound pressure, and jet airflows in the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris. Whereas particle velocity and sound pressure were found all around and above vibrating individuals, there was no evidence for a jet airflow as with honey bees. The largest particle velocities were measured 5 mm above the wings (16.0±4.8 mm s-1). Around a vibrating individual, we found maximum particle velocities of 8.6±3.0 mm s-1 (horizontal particle velocity) in front of the bee's head and of 6.0±2.1 mm s-1 (vertical particle velocity) behind its wings. Wing oscillations, which are mainly responsible for air particle movements in honey bees, significantly contributed to vertically oriented particle oscillations only close to the abdomen in M. scutellaris (distances ≤5 mm). Almost 80% of the hive bees attending trophallactic food transfers stayed within a range of 5 mm from the vibrating foragers. It remains to be shown, however, whether air particle velocity alone is strong enough to be detected by Johnston's organ of the bee antenna. Taking the physiological properties of the honey bee's Johnston's organ as the reference, M. scutellaris hive bees are able to detect the forager vibrations through particle movements at distances of up to 2 cm.",Article,Scopus

We obtained data on natural levels of geitonogamy in the deceptive orchids Dactylorhiza sambucina and Himantoglossum hircinum by monitoring the dispersal and receipt of colour-coded pollinia. As donors, we marked 185 flowers of D. sambucina and 956 flowers of H. hircinum. In D. sambucina, 30% of the pollinator-visited flowers and 62% of the marked inflorescences experienced geitonogamous pollination events. In H. hircinum, the respective percentages were 36 and 71%. The furthest pollen transport distance in the Andrena-pollinated H. hircinum was 6.9 m (median 1.27 m), while the furthest transport in the bumblebee-pollinated D. sambucina was 176 m (median 1.23 m), a record in Orchidaceae. An analysis of pollen-tracking studies in orchids revealed geitonogamy levels of around 40% (based on individuals; 19-37% based on flowers) in both rewardless species and rewarding ones. This is similar to geitonogamy levels in other animal-pollinated angiosperms, although the data basis for comparison may still be too small.

To examine whether this is due to the landscape context farms are situated in and traits of the studied organisms, we surveyed bumble bees in cereal field borders and margins at 12 pairs of matched organic and conventional farms, with half the pairs located in heterogeneous farmland and the remaining in homogeneous plains. Species richness and abundance of bumble bees were significantly positively related to both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity. However, there was an interaction effect between farming practice and landscape context so that species richness and abundance were only significantly higher on organic farms in homogeneous landscapes. The higher abundance of bumble bees on organic farms was partly related to higher flower abundance on these sites. The effect of landscape context on bumble bee abundance was stronger for species with medium sized colonies than for those with smaller and larger colony sizes. These patterns may reflect that species with medium sized foraging ranges are most affected by fragmentation of foraging habitat, because colony size reflects the spatial scale at which bumble bees utilize resources. We conclude that both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity can be used to increase bumble bee species richness and abundance, but that organic farming has a larger effect in homogeneous landscapes and landscape heterogeneity a larger effect on conventional farms. The effects differed between species, suggesting that a single prescription to increase pollinator abundance may not be valid. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

For nectar, which consists mainly of sugars, profitability is usually defined by its energetic value. Nectars, however, also contain a wide range of trace components, some of which affect their attractiveness. Honeybees produce honey from nectar. We compared the round dance and trophallaxis behaviours of bees foraging on avocado and citrus honey solutions, as a substitute for nectars. These sources differ in their trace-elements composition, with avocado nectar and honey containing higher concentrations of minerals than citrus nectar and honey. In a second experiment, we compared the behaviour of bees foraging on sucrose solution and sucrose solution enriched with four major mineral components of avocado nectar. Subjects foraging on avocado honey had a significantly lower probability of dancing than those foraging on citrus honey, a rate of direction reversals that was almost one half, a lower total number of reversals, shorter dance duration and longer trophallaxis time. When avocado honey was supplied to bees that previously fed on citrus honey, most of them avoided it, indicating a strong context effect. When foraging on mineral-enriched sugar solution, dance variables tended to be lower compared with sucrose solution without minerals, but differences were smaller than the differences between the honey solutions.

We studied the foraging activity and fruit production of tomato using one colony of Nannotrigona perilampoides (NP) and one colony of Bombus impatiens (BI) in greenhouses with ≈1000 plants. Mechanical vibration (MV) was included as a test treatment. The foraging activity was measured as the number of flowers visited within 5 min, the time spent on a flower collecting pollen, the number of visits that a flower received and the duration of a foraging trip. BI collected pollen more rapidly, visited more flowers within 5 min and did more visits per flower when compared with NP that also lasted longer in their trips. Significant correlations were found between environmental variables and the number of bees entering the hive and the number of bees on the flowers. For NP, the highest correlation was found for light intensity whilst in BI a negative effect of environmental temperature was detected. Regarding the quantity of fruit, BI resulted in higher fruit set when compared with NP, but the latter performed similarly to MV. However, the weight of the fruit and seed number was significantly higher for BI when compared with NP, and this was higher than for MV. Our results demonstrate that at the densities of tomato plants tested, one colony of BI was more efficient pollinator when compared with NP. We suggest that pollination efficiency of NP could have been limited by a reduced number of foragers on the plants at a given time and their limited flight range when compared with BI. Therefore, it will be necessary to evaluate if increasing densities of colonies of NP could improve tomato yield in tropical greenhouses.",Article,Scopus

Here, we investigate patterns of outcrossed mating through male function in Narcissus triandrus, a tristylous, bee-pollinated wild daffodil from the Iberian Peninsula, to test pollen transfer models which predict that floral morphology promotes asymmetrical mating and biased morph ratios. Unlike other tristylous species, N. triandrus has an incompatibility system that permits intra-morph mating and long-level rather than mid-level stamens in the L-morph. Incomplete sex-organ reciprocity should result in significant intra-morph mating in the L-morph. We measured mating patterns in two L-biased populations - dimorphic (two style morphs) and trimorphic (three style morphs) - using multilocus genotyping and maximum-likelihood-based paternity analysis. We also examined the spatial distribution of style morphs and neutral markers to investigate the potential consequence of spatially restricted mating on morph ratios. As predicted, we detected significant amounts of intra-morph mating in the L-morph in both populations. Pollen transfer coefficients generally supported predictions based on the Darwinian hypothesis that anthers and stigmas of equivalent level promote pollinator-mediated cross-pollination in heterostylous populations. There was evidence of significant spatial aggregation of both style morphs and neutral markers in populations of N. triandrus, probably as a result of restricted pollen and seed dispersal. Our results provide empirical support for theoretical models of pollen transfer, which indicate that the commonly observed L-biased morph ratios in Narcissus species result from significant intra-morph mating in the L-morph because of its atypical floral morphology. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.",Article,Scopus

We examined natural and introduced populations of C. torelliana for 4 years to determine the species of bees that disperse seeds, and the extent and distance of seed dispersal. The mechanism of seed dispersal by bees was also investigated, including fruit traits that promote dispersal, foraging behaviour of bees at fruits, and the fate of seeds. The fruit structure of C. torelliana, with seed presented in a resin reward, is a unique trait that promotes seed dispersal by bees and often results in long-distance dispersal. We discovered that a guild of four species of stingless bees, Trigona carbonaria, T. clypearis, T. sapiens, and T. hockingsi, dispersed seeds of C. torelliana in its natural range. More than half of the nests found within 250 m of fruiting trees had evidence of seed transport. Seeds were transported minimum distances of 20-220 m by bees. Approximately 88% of seeds were dispersed by gravity but almost all fruits retained one or two seeds embedded in resin for bee dispersal. Bee foraging for resin peaked immediately after fruit opening and corresponded to a peak of seed dispersal at the hive. There were strong correlations between numbers of seeds brought in and taken out of each hive by bees (r = 0.753-0.992, P < 0.05), and germination rates were 95 ± 5%. These results showed that bee-transported seeds were effectively dispersed outside of the hive soon after release from fruits. Seed dispersal by bees is a non-standard dispersal mechanism for C. torelliana, as most seeds are dispersed by gravity before bees can enter fruits. However, many C. torelliana seeds are dispersed by bees, since seeds are retained in almost all fruits, and all of these are dispersed by bees. © 2007 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

ARTs for mate searching are particularly common and often involve a division between high-investment or high-risk but sedentary, nondispersing tactics and low-investment or low-risk but active, dispersing, searching tactics with longer-range movements. ARTs in insects are often associated with intense sexual selection and include individuals that avoid costly or high-risk intrasexual interactions, parasitizing the costly investment of others, or circumventing intersexual interactions and mate conflict. Two or more tactics can arise in a population when opportunities for success are discrete and require different and mutually exclusive behavior or morphology. Suites of distinctive, correlated traits arise through condition-dependent, developmental switches and when there is selection against individuals with intermediate traits (disruptive selection). ARTs are maintained in populations by frequency dependence and equality of fitness among tactics or as condition- or environment-dependent alternatives that maximize individual fitness. THE PROBLEM Discrete, alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) within one sex and one population occur in most groups of insects (Table 8.1). For example, nonflying, large-headed, fighting males live in the nests of some female halictid (Kukuk and Schwarz 1988) and andrenid bees (Danforth 1991b) and mate with females inside the nest just prior to oviposition; while smaller, flying males with normal-looking heads and mandibles mate with females outside the nest as they forage on flowers (Danforth 1991b) (Figure 8.1). © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",Book Chapter,Scopus

These include passerine birds and insects of four different orders, Hymenoptera (mainly Apidae), Diptera (mainly Nemestrinidae), Coleoptera (Scarabacidae), and Lepidoptera (mainly Noctuidae). Apid pollination involves two discrete systems - passive pollination by anthophorines and native Apis mellifera foraging for nectar and active pollen gathering by A. mellifera and other Apoidea foraging for pollen. From what is known about relationships within Babiana and Crocoideae, it seems likely that passive pollination by anthophorines and honeybees, with nectar secreted in zygomorphic, bilabiate flowers as a reward, is the ancestral condition; it is also the most common, demonstrated for 18 and inferred for 35 more species from all three taxonormc sections of the genus. Active pollination by honeybees and female Apoidea foraging for pollen was demonstrated in one species and is inferred for four more, all of which have radially symmetric flowers and prominent anthers. Pollination by long-proboscid nemestrinids, mostly species of Prosoeca, is recorded for 13 species and inferred for five more, while moth pollination is recorded for one species and inferred for another two. Pollination exclusively by hopbine scarab beetles, known for six species, is associated with development of radial symmetry of the flower. Passerine bird pollination, associated with the classic syndrome of a wide floral tube, red floral pigmentation, and rigid, well-exserted stamens, occurs in two species, and is inferred for one more. Species with a bimodal system in which bees and beetles both visit and accomplish pollen transfer is known for three species. Comparing pollination systems with what is known about species relationships in Babiana, we infer that long-proboscid fly pollination evolved at least four times and moth pollination three times. Active pollination by pollen-collecting bees and hopliine beetle pollination also probably evolved three times each and bird pollination twice. Pollination systems are labile, and we postulate that there has been a minimum of 14 shifts in pollination system, approximately one shift for every six species. Lastly, Babiana species show the same correlation of morphology and floral presentation with particular sets of pollinators, described for several other genera of Iridaceae, e.g., Gladiolus L., Hesperantha Ker Gawl., and Lapeirousia Pourr., as well as Geraniaceae and Orchidaceae.

This study has identified a wide range of foraging plant sources for honeybees and demonstrates adequate potential for expanding and sustaining beekeeping in Muscat, and in the Al Batinah region. A modern pollen reference collection of 105 local floral species enabled the identification of the pollen types. Seventy‐four pollen types were found in the 48 honey samples. The identifications of pollen types are based on both light and scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies of the pollen in the honey and reference samples. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

To evaluate the risk of the returning flight of honeybee workers collecting water in comparison to nectar foraging bees three experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, workers drinking water from a watering trough and workers drinking sucrose solution from a feeder were caught and released a few hundred meters away. The proportion of water and nectar foragers returning to the nest was checked. In the second experiment only water-foraging workers displaced and released were tested. Some of them were allowed to drink water, and others were fed with sucrose solution immediately after reaching the watering trough. In both experiments the ratio of workers returning to the nests was significantly lower for those with water in their crops than for those with sucrose solution. The third experiment showed that experienced workers flying to the feeder with sucrose solution had less sugar in their crops (on average 0.1 mg) than did workers flyingto the water source (on average 0.2 mg), although both nectar and water foragers covered the same distance from the hive. These results consistently suggest that foragers with water in the crop have no reserve of metabolic fuel, so that they are facing a higher risk of not returning to the nest than nectar foraging bees. To reduce this risk, water foragers leave their nest with bigger amounts of sugar in their crops than do nectar foragers.",Article,Scopus

The reason for this imprecision has been the subject of recent debate. Some have suggested that imprecision within dances is non-adaptive, ie, that dancing bees are limited in their ability to indicate more precise directional information; two hypotheses regarding possible limitations are examined. The 'brief-return-phase' hypothesis proposes that when signaling a nearby food source, the duration of the return phase (the time between successive waggle phases) is brief and a dancing bee does not have enough time or space to orient her waggle phases precisely. Similarly, the 'brief-waggle-phase' hypothesis proposes that a short waggle-phase duration prevents dancing bees from precisely orienting their waggle phases. Other investigators have suggested that the imprecision within dances is adaptive. The 'tuned-error' hypothesis proposes that the imprecision in dances serves to spread recruits over an optimal patch size tuned by natural selection. Here, these three hypotheses are investigated by analyzing 572 dances for food sources at 10 distances from the hive. It was found that the duration of the return phase does not differ in dances for near and far food sources, indicating that the imprecision is not caused by limitations imposed by brief return phases. It was also found that the scatter of waggle phase angles after left or right turns does not steadily increase as waggle phase duration decreases, indicating that the imprecision is not caused by limitations imposed by brief waggle phases. Finally, it was found that while patch size indicated within dances increases as distance to the food source increases, it does so at a rate significantly less than would be expected if bees were not adjusting their directional information in response to distance, thereby supporting the hypothesis of an adaptive value to the imprecision within dances for nearby food sources. © 2007 E.

Darwin proposed memory limitations as a potential mechanistic explanation for this flower constancy behaviour. This reanalysis of a previously published dataset, relating a real-time sequential analysis of bumblebee flower choices to the distance distribution between flowers in a natural meadow, shows that Darwin was right in an unexpected way. Bees (Bombus spp) can learn how to extract rewards from several flower species, and switching between flower species does not compromise their handling efficiency (i e flower handling times do not increase following a species switch). However, bees do lose time flying between flowers. If a flower is encountered within a short time (0-2 secs) after the last flower visit, it is likely to be visited only if it is the same species. After longer intervals (3-6 secs), bees are more likely to switch to visiting different flower species. Thus, flower constancy is in part an effect based on comparing incoming stimuli (the flowers a bee detects in flight) with a transient form of short-term (working) memory, which holds the signal of the last visited flower. The relative weighting of working and reference memory changes as time passes following a flower visit. This results in a low probability of retrieving the memory for a different flower species (from that just visited) within a short time interval after the most recent flower visit (0-2 secs). This probability rises as the signal of the last visited flower fades from working memory (>2 secs). © 2007 E. Schweizerbart'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung.",Article,Scopus

The locomotor rhythm in foragers of the Japanese honeybee, Apis cerana japonica, was entrained to a skeleton temperature cycle. An initial warm temperature pulse was imposed at the beginning of subjective day and a second was applied at the end of the subjective day. A single warm pulse given every early subjective day in constant darkness (DD) entrained the locomotor rhythm without a second temperature pulse, but a single pulse given in late subjective day allowed a free-running rhythm. When honeybees were kept under a light-dark cycle, their body temperatures increased by 7-8 °C with locomotor activity. This temperature elevation remained during the photophase but followed the ambient environmental temperature at night. Body temperature oscillations continued to be circadian in DD, and temperature elevation occurred during the subjective day. In DD, the free-running period τ of locomotor activity increased when the ambient temperature increased from 27 to 37 °C, although these changes were within the range of temperature compensation for many organisms. Under continuous light conditions (LL), τ remained constant with more strict temperature compensation. Patterns of brain period mRNA levels of forager bees maintained at different temperatures in LL revealed that the free-running period of per mRNA rhythm was temperature compensated. In addition, temperature strongly influenced the amplitude of the circadian transcriptional rhythms during the free-run period in LL, which may confer temperature compensation. We also discuss the possibility that daily changes in forager body temperatures may act as an internal Zeitgeber by fluctuating hive temperature. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Honey bees are imported for pollination, although the area in which the Park is embedded has over 700 species of native bees, many of which are potential orchard pollinators. We studied the visitation of native bees to apple, pear, apricot, and sweet cherry over 2 years. Thirty species of bees visited the flowers but, except for pear flowers, most were uncommon compared to honey bees. Evidence that honey bees prevented native bees from foraging on orchard crop flowers was equivocal: generally, honey bee and native bee visitation rates to the flowers were not negatively correlated, nor were native bee visitation rates positively correlated with distance of orchards from honey bee hives. Conversely, competition was tentatively suggested by much larger numbers of honey bees than natives on the flowers of apples, apricots and cherry; and by the large increase of native bees on pears, where honey bee numbers were low. At least one-third of the native bee species visiting the flowers are potential pollinators, including cavity-nesting species such as Osmia lignaria propinqua, currently managed for small orchard pollination in the US, plus several fossorial species, including one rosaceous flower specialist (Andrena milwaukiensis). We suggest that gradual withdrawal of honey bees from the Park would help conserve native bee populations without decreasing orchard crop productivity, and would serve as a demonstration of the commercial value of native pollinators. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",Article,Scopus

Honey bees live in large eusocial colonies in which a single queen is responsible for reproduction, several thousand sterile female worker bees complete a myriad of tasks to maintain the colony, and several hundred male drones exist only to mate. The ""queen substance"" [also termed the queen retinue pheromone (QRP)] is an eight-component pheromone that maintains the queen's dominance in the colony. The main component, 9-ODA, acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting workers to the queen and as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting worker ovary development; it also acts as a sex pheromone, attracting drones during mating flights. However, the extent to which social and sexual chemical messages are shared remains unresolved. By using a custom chemosensory-specific microarray and qPCR, we identified four candidate sex pheromone Ors (AmOr10, -11, -18, and -170) from the honey bee genome based on their biased expression in drone antennae. We assayed the pheromone responsiveness of these receptors by using Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiology. AmOr11 responded specifically to 9-ODA (EC50 = 280 ± 31 nM) and not to any of the other seven QRP components, other social pheromones, or floral odors. We did not observe any responses of the other three Ors to any of the eight QRP pheromone components, suggesting 9-ODA is the only QRP component that also acts as a long-distance sex pheromone. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Article,Scopus

The foraging behaviour of these pollinators was observed in two environment types to determine their patch-leaving decisions. The rich environment was composed of male-fertile flowers, offering pollen and nectar, and the poor one of male-sterile flowers, offering little nectar and no pollen. The experimental design consisted of a patch system in which inflorescences were evenly arranged in two rows (1 m distance). Residence times of foragers inside inflorescences and rows were analysed by a Cox proportional hazards model, taking into account recent and past experience acquired during the foraging bout. Most of the results showed a decremental motivational mechanism, that is, a reduction in the residence time on the inflorescence or in the row related to exploitation of flowers within inflorescences and inflorescences within rows These results indicate that bumblebees tend to leave the patch using departure rules similar to those found in parasitoids.

Sensory neurons of the dorsal rim area of the compound eyes, involved in acquiring sun-compass based information, project to the dorsal-most part of the medulla.

One possible mechanism by which bees could discriminate between flowers before visiting them is by detecting nectar via its odours. To test this idea, we observed visits by solitary bees in the genus Osmia (Megachilidae) to flowers of Penstemon caesius (Scrophulariaceae) in the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California. We observed that free-foraging Osmia bees visited flowers containing nectar seven times more frequently than they visited nectar-depleted flowers. To test whether bees could detect the presence of nectar via odour cues, we compared floral preferences between trials where we blocked the olfactory capabilities of bees by coating their antennae with nontoxic silicone and where bees foraged with uncovered antennae. We randomly assigned the order of the silicone treatments and attempted to test 32 bees at P. caesius arrays containing nectar-depleted flowers, nectar-depleted flowers with added water and nectar-rewarding control flowers. Bees with uncovered antennae visited more than twice as many control flowers as they did either group of nectar-depleted flowers. In contrast, bees foraging with silicone-covered antennae visited all treatment flowers equally. Bees that completed both trials visited nectar-rewarding control flowers twice as frequently while foraging with uncovered antennae as they did while foraging with silicone-coated antennae.

Many flowers were damaged by phytophagous insects. Nectar volume was markedly lower in flowers with damaged petals (which were also likely to be older) and in flowers that had nectar-robbing holes. We test whether bees exhibit selectivity with regards to the individual flowers, which they approach and enter, and whether this selectivity enhances foraging efficiency. The flowers approached (within 2 cm) by A. mellifera and B. hortorum were non-random when compared to the floral population; both species selectively approached un-blemished flowers. They both approached more yellow flowers than would be expected by chance, presumably a reflection of innate colour preferences, for nectar standing crop did not vary according to flower colour. Bees were also more likely to accept (land on) un-blemished flowers. A. mellifera gathering nectar exhibited selectivity with regards to the presence of robbing holes, being more likely to land on robbed flowers (they are not able to feed on un-robbed flowers). That they frequently approached un-robbed flowers suggests that they are not able to detect robbing holes at long-range, so that foraging efficiency may be limited by visual acuity. Nevertheless, by using a combination of long-range and short-range selectivity, nectar-gathering A. mellifera and B. hortorum greatly increased the average reward from the flowers on which they landed (by 68% and 48%, respectively) compared to the average standing crop in the flower population. Overall, our results demonstrate that bees use obvious floral cues (colour and petal blemishes) at long-range, but can switch to using more subtle cues (robbing holes) at close range. They also make many mistakes and some cues used do not correlate with floral rewards. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

However, during the early years of breeding and seed increase, there was some uncertainty among regulators about containment measures needed to prevent the movement of regulated GM traits into adjacent fields of conventional cotton and possibly into the human or animal food chain. This was particularly relevant in the more tropical north of Australia that was being used as a winter nursery. Field experiments on GM cottons in eastern Australia were commonplace, but even there, regulators required confirmation that the containment practices already in place (buffer zones and isolation distances) were effective. A series of experiments in a range of environments, designed to monitor the movement of GM pollen into adjacent cotton buffers, adjacent fields, across bare ground and over long distances are reported here. Gene flow from GM plots into adjacent conventional cotton was found to be much higher in northern Australia than in eastern Australia, most likely due to higher honey bee (Apis mellifera) numbers, often deliberately enhanced to aid the surrounding horticultural industries. Movement of pollen over bare ground to nearby crops was observed at a number of locations indicating that small isolation zones should not be used for containment of regulated GM cotton. In general, buffers of 20 m of conventional cotton surrounding GM plots proved to be highly effective unless bee numbers were artificially high. Based on insect observations and rates of pollen flow, it was concluded that pollen beetles (Carpophilus spp.), another potential pollen vector normally highly abundant in cotton, were not associated with movement of pollen more than 1 m away from crops.

In this study, we examine the possible factors affecting the learning and retention of nest-associated visual cues by the Australian desert ant Melophorus bagoti and the manner in which such cues are encoded by foraging ants. We placed four prominent cylindrical landmarks around a nest and trained foragers from that nest to a food source. Ants were tested with the landmark array in a distant testing field after (1) a known number of exposures to the landmarks (1, 3, 7 or 15 trials, spread over a period of 1 day, 2 days or ≥3 days) and (2) after a known period of delay (0, 24, 48, 96 or 192 h). The results show that a combination of an increase in training trials and an increase in number of training days affected the acquisition of landmark memory. Moreover, once the landmarks were learnt, they became a part of long-term memory and lasted throughout the ants' foraging lifetime. To examine visual cue encoding behaviour, ants trained under similar conditions for 4 days were tested with (1) an identical landmark array, (2) landmarks of the same size used in training, but placed at twice the distance from each other, and (3) landmarks whose dimensions were doubled and placed at twice the distance from each other. In conditions (1) and (3), the ants searched extensively at the centre of the four landmarks, suggesting that, similar to the Saharan ant (genus Cataglyphis) and the honeybee, M. bagoti too uses a snapshot to match the view of the landmarks around the nest. But contrary to the snapshot model, in condition (2), the ants did not search extensively at the centre of the landmarks, but searched primarily 0.5 m from the landmark, the distance from each landmark to the nest during training. We discuss how various search models fare in accounting for these findings. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

Their life-history is dominated by a period of within-nest activity followed by a phase of long-distance flights and foraging. General insights into insect metabolism imply that foraging onset is associated with fundamental metabolic changes, and theory on social evolution suggests metabolic adaptations that are advantageous for the colony as a whole. Results: Here we address the life-history characteristics of workers with LC-MS/MS based relative quantification of major proteins. Our approach includes: i. Calculation of a false positive rate for the identifications, ii. Support of relative protein quantification results obtained from spectral count by non-parametric statistics, and iii. Correction for Type 1 error inflation using a bootstrap iteration analysis. Our data are consistent with the use of glucose as the main fuel for honey bee flight. Moreover, the data delivers information on the expression of ATPsynthases/ATPases, and provide new insights into nurse- and forager-specific patterns of protection against oxidative stress. Conclusion: The results show the suitability of this approach to investigate fundamental biochemical changes in an insect, and provide new evidence for metabolic specializations that occur during the social ontogeny of worker honey bees. © 2007 Wolschin and Amdam; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Studies with honeybees showed that recruitment precision is not a fixed feature, but it may be enhanced by factors like experience and distance. However, little is known regarding the recruitment precision of stingless bees. Hence, in this study, we examined the effects of experience and spatial distance on the precision of the food communication system of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona mexicana. We conducted the experiments by training bees to a three-dimensional artificial patch at several distances from the colony. We recorded the choices of individual recruited foragers, either being newcomers (foragers without experience with the advertised food source) or experienced (foragers that had previously visited the feeder). We found that the average precision of newcomers (95.6 ± 2.61%) was significantly higher than that of experienced bees (80.2 ± 1.12%). While this might seem counter-intuitive on first sight, this ""loss"" of precision can be explained by the tendency of experienced recruits to explore nearby areas to find new rewarding food sources after they had initially learned the exact location of the food source. Increasing the distance from the colony had no significant effect on the precision of the foraging bees. Thus, our data show that experience, but not the distance of the food source, affected the patch precision of S. mexicana foragers. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

The resulting matrix represents visually estimated sibling groups along its diagonal. This method can be applied to all haplodiploid species to estimate full siblingship. In particular, SLCA does not require the estimation of allele frequency in a population. It is difficult to conduct large-scale sampling when studying wild populations, and hence we cannot accurately estimate allele frequency. Therefore, SLCA would solve various problems in estimating social structure, mating behavior, and the dispersal range of wild insect populations, for which the collection of large amounts of data is prohibitive. To illustrate our algorithm, we used two types of actual microsatellite data collected from wild populations of Bombus ardens and Bombus diversus.

But they also pose a threat through the disruption of locally adapted gene pools. At Hyams Beach, New South Wales, Australia, four bushland stands of the rare shrub, Grevillea macleayana McGillivray, surround an urban area containing remnant and cultivated specimens of this species. Numbers of inflorescences per plant, fruits per plant, and visits by pollinators were similar for plants in urban gardens and bushland. Urban plants represented a substantial but complex genetic resource, displaying more genetic diversity than bushland plants judged by He, numbers of alleles per locus, and number of private alleles. Of 27 private alleles in urban plants, 17 occurred in a set of 19 exotic plants. Excluding the exotic plants, all five stands displayed a moderate differentiation (FST = 0.14 ± 0.02), although the urban remnants clustered with two of the bushland stands. These patterns may be explained by high levels of selfing and inbreeding in this species and by long-distance dispersal (several seeds in the urban stand were fathered by plants in other stands). Genetic leakage (gene flow) from exotic plants to 321 seeds on surrounding remnant or bushland plants has not occurred. Our results demonstrate the conservation value of this group of urban plants, which are viable, productive, genetically diverse, and interconnected with bushland plants. Gene flow has apparently not yet led to genetic contamination of bushland populations, but high levels of inbreeding would make this a rare event and difficult to detect.

One group foraged in a stable array of six flowers for 40 foraging bouts, thereby enabling it to establish a long-term memory of the array, and adjust its spatial movements accordingly. The other group was faced with an array that changed between (but not within) foraging bouts, and thus had only access to a working memory of the flowers that had been visited. Bees in the stable array started out sampling a variety of routes, but their tendency to visit flowers in a repeatable, stable order (""traplining"") increased drastically with experience. These bees used shorter routes and converged on four popular paths. However, these routes were mainly formed through linking pairs of flowers by near-neighbour movements, rather than attempting to minimize overall travel distance. Individuals had variations to a primary sequence, where some bees used a major sequence most often, followed by a minor less used route, and others used two different routes with equal frequency. Even though bees foraging in the spatially randomized array had access to both spatial working memory and scent marks, this manipulation greatly disrupted foraging efficiency, mainly via an increase in revisitation to previously emptied flowers and substantially longer search times. Hence, a stable reference frame greatly improves foraging even for bees in relatively small arrays of flowers. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

The recently released draft genomic sequence for the bee will accelerate honeybee behavioral genetics. Although we lack sufficient tools to manipulate this genome easily, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that influence natural variation in behavior have been identified and tested for their effects on correlated behavioral traits. We review what is known about the genetics and physiology of two behavioral traits in honeybees, foraging specialization (pollen versus nectar), and defensive behavior, and present evidence that map-based cloning of genes is more feasible in the bee than in other metazoans. We also present bioinformatic analyses of candidate genes within QTL confidence intervals (CIs). The high recombination rate of the bee made it possible to narrow the search to regions containing only 17-61 predicted peptides for each QTL, although CIs covered large genetic distances. Knowledge of correlated behavioral traits, comparative bioinformatics, and expression assays facilitated evaluation of candidate genes. An overrepresentation of genes involved in ovarian development and insulin-like signaling components within pollen foraging QTL regions suggests that an ancestral reproductive gene network was co-opted during the evolution of foraging specialization. The major QTL influencing defensive/aggressive behavior contains orthologs of genes involved in central nervous system activity and neurogenesis. Candidates at the other two defensive-behavior QTLs include modulators of sensory signaling (Am5HT 7 serotonin receptor, AmArr4 arrestin, and GABA-B-R1 receptor).

Management of mobile organisms contributing to ecosystem services requires consideration not only of the local scale where services are delivered, but also the distribution of resources at the landscape scale, and the foraging ranges and dispersal movements of the mobile agents. We develop a conceptual model for exploring how one such mobile-agent-based ecosystem service (MABES), pollination, is affected by land-use change, and then generalize the model to other MABES. The model includes interactions and feedbacks among policies affecting land use, market forces and the biology of the organisms involved. Animal-mediated pollination contributes to the production of goods of value to humans such as crops; it also bolsters reproduction of wild plants on which other services or service-providing organisms depend. About one-third of crop production depends on animal pollinators, while 60-90% of plant species require an animal pollinator. The sensitivity of mobile organisms to ecological factors that operate across spatial scales makes the services provided by a given community of mobile agents highly contextual. Services vary, depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources surrounding the site, and on biotic interactions occurring locally, such as competition among pollinators for resources, and among plants for pollinators. The value of the resulting goods or services may feed back via market-based forces to influence land-use policies, which in turn influence land management practices that alter local habitat conditions and landscape structure. Developing conceptual models for MABES aids in identifying knowledge gaps, determining research priorities, and targeting interventions that can be applied in an adaptive management context. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Review,Scopus

We studied the effects of distance to forest, tree management, and floral resources on bee communities in pastures (the dominant land-use type) in southern Costa Rica. Over two years, we sampled bees and floral resources in 21 pastures at three distance classes from a large (∼230-ha) forest patch and of three common types: open pasture; pasture with remnant trees; and pasture with live fences. We found no consistent differences in bee diversity or abundance with respect to pasture management or floral resources. Bee community composition, however, was strikingly different at forest edges as compared to deforested countryside only a few hundred meters from forest. At forest edges, native social stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) comprised ∼50% of the individuals sampled, while the alien honeybee Apis mellifera made up only ∼5%. Away from forests, meliponines dropped to ∼20% of sampled bees, whereas Apis increased to ∼45%. Meliponine bees were also more speciose at forest edge sites than at a distance from forest, their abundance decreased with continuous distance to the nearest forest patch, and their species richness was correlated with the proportion of forest cover surrounding sample sites at scales from 200 to 1200 m. Meliponines and Apis together comprise the eusocial bee fauna of the study area and are unique in quickly recruiting foragers to high-quality resources. The diverse assemblage of native meliponine bees covers a wide range of body sizes and flower foraging behavior not found in Apis, and populations of many bee species (including Apis), are known to fluctuate considerably from year to year. Thus, the forest-related changes in eusocial bee communities we found may have important implications for: (1) sustaining a diverse bee fauna in tropical countryside; (2) ensuring the effective pollination of a diverse native plant community; and (3) the efficiency and stability of agricultural pollination, particularly for short-time-scale, mass-flowering crops such as coffee. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus

Memorization of these cues facilitates the localization and recognition of food sources during foraging flights. Bees can also use information gained inside the hive during social interactions with successful foragers. An important information cue that can be learned during these interactions is food odor. However, little is known about how floral odors learned in the hive affect later decisions of foragers in the field. We studied the effect of food scent on foraging preferences when this learning is acquired directly inside the hive. By using in-hive feeders that were removed 24 h before the test, we showed that foragers use the odor information acquired during a 3-day stimulation period with a scented solution during a food-choice situation outside the nest. This bias in food preference is maintained even 24 h after the replacement of all the hive combs. Thus, without being previously collected outside by foragers, food odors learned within the hive can be used during short-range foraging flights. Moreover, correct landings at a dual-choice device after replacing the storing combs suggests that long-term memories formed within the colony can be retrieved while bees search for food in the field. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

The sound and air flows generated by dancer's wing and abdominal vibrations have been implicated as important cues, but the decoding mechanisms for these dance messages are poorly understood. To understand the neural mechanisms of honey bee dance communication, we analyzed the anatomy of antenna and Johnston's organ (JO) in the pedicel of the antenna, as well as the mechanical and neural response characteristics of antenna and JO to acoustic stimuli, respectively. The honey bee JO consists of about 300-320 scolopidia connected with about 48 cuticular ""knobs"" around the circumference of the pedicel. Each scolopidium contains bipolar sensory neurons with both type I and II cilia. The mechanical sensitivities of the antennal flagellum are specifically high in response to low but not high intensity stimuli of 265-350 Hz frequencies. The structural characteristics of antenna but not JO neurons seem to be responsible for the non-linear responses of the flagellum in contrast to mosquito and fruit fly. The honey bee flagellum is a sensitive movement detector responding to 20 nm tip displacement, which is comparable to female mosquito. Furthermore, the JO neurons have the ability to preserve both frequency and temporal information of acoustic stimuli including the ""waggle dance"" sound. Intriguingly, the response of JO neurons was found to be age-dependent, demonstrating that the dance communication is only possible between aged foragers. These results suggest that the matured honey bee antennae and JO neurons are best tuned to detect 250-300 Hz sound generated during ""waggle dance"" from the distance in a dark hive, and that sufficient responses of the JO neurons are obtained by reducing the mechanical sensitivity of the flagellum in a near-field of dancer. This nonlinear effect brings about dynamic range compression in the honey bee auditory system. © 2007 Tsujiuchi et al.",Article,Scopus

In intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, many species are confined to very small uncultivated areas such as field margins. However, it has been suggested that these small habitat elements cannot support viable populations of all the species observed there. Instead, species richness and abundance in these small habitat fragments may, at least partly, be dependent on dispersal from larger semi-natural grassland fragments. 2. We tested this hypothesis for butterflies and bumble bees in 12 independent landscapes in a region of intense agriculture in southern Sweden. In each landscape we surveyed abundance and species richness in one semi-natural grassland, one linear habitat (uncultivated field margin) adjacent to this (called proximate) and one similar linear habitat (called distant) situated at least 1000 m from the semi-natural grassland patch. 3. Both species richness and density (individuals per unit area) of butterflies and bumble bees were significantly higher in proximate linear habitats than in distant ones. Moreover, butterfly species richness was higher for a given area in grasslands than in any of the linear habitat types. Butterfly density in grasslands did not differ from that in proximate linear habitats but was lower in distant linear habitats. The effect of isolation on density was stronger for less mobile butterfly species. For bumble bees there was no difference in species richness between grasslands and proximate linear habitats. 4. For at least some of the butterfly species even these relatively small fragments of semi-natural grasslands act as population sources from which individuals disperse to the surrounding habitats and thereby contribute to higher densities and species richness in adjacent areas. For bumble bees, it is more likely that the grasslands contain a higher density of nests than the surrounding intensively cultivated landscape, and that the density of foraging bumble bees decreases with increasing distance from the nest. 5. Synthesis and application. Habitat fragmentation and intensified agricultural practices are considered to be a threat against services provided by pollinators. In order to sustain the abundance and diversity of insect pollinators in intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, we suggest that preservation of the remaining semi-natural grasslands or re-creation of flower-rich grasslands is essential. © 2006 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

Declines in abundance and diversity of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) in Europe have been linked to agricultural intensification and the resulting loss of suitable foraging and nesting habitats. Environmental Stewardship (ES) is a new scheme in England offering the opportunity to restore habitats of value for these important pollinators to agricultural land. Scientific evaluation of the options prescribed within the scheme is essential to ensure that their objectives are met and that the benefits can be realized by the full bumble bee species assemblage. 2. We compared the efficacy of different ES options for field margins on arable land in enhancing the abundance and diversity of flowering resources and foraging bumble bees. Our study was conducted over 3 years using a multisite experiment. 3. Overall, uncropped margins sown with mixtures containing nectar and pollen-producing plants were more effective in providing bumble bee forage than margins sown with a grass mix, allowed to regenerate naturally or managed as conservation headlands. 4. A mixture of agricultural legumes established quickly and attracted on average the highest total abundance and diversity of bumble bees, including the rare long-tongued species Bombus ruderatus and Bombus muscorum. However, marked differences were observed between species and sexes in their responses to field margin management over time. 5. A diverse mixture of native wildflowers attracted more of the shorter-tongued Bombus spp. and provided greater continuity of forage resources, especially early in the season. Allowing Cirsium spp. to flower on such margins also increased their attractiveness to male bumble bees. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the legume-based 'pollen and nectar flower mix', as prescribed under Entry Level Stewardship in England, can quickly provide a highly attractive forage resource for bumble bees, but that issues of seasonal flowering phenology and longevity of the mixture need to be addressed. Establishment of 'floristically enhanced margins' under Higher Level Stewardship will be important to provide diverse perennial communities of forage plants and to support a greater range of Bombus spp. and other pollinators.

However, whereas extensive electrophysiological studies have been undertaken over the past ten years to characterize ionic currents underlying the physiological neuronal activity in honeybee, ionic currents underlying skeletal muscle fibre activity in this insect remain, so far, unexplored. Here, we show that, in contrast to many other insect species, action potentials in muscle fibres isolated from adult honeybee metathoracic tibia, are not graded but actual all-or-none responses. Action potentials are blocked by Cd2+ and La3+ but not by tetrodotoxin (TTX) in current-clamp mode of the patch-clamp technique, and as assessed under voltage-clamp, both Ca2+ and K+ currents are involved in shaping action potentials in single muscle fibres. The activation threshold potential for the voltage-dependent Ca2+ current is close to -40 mV, its mean maximal amplitude is -8.5±1.9 A/F and the mean apparent reversal potential is near +40 mV. In honeybees, GABA does not activate any ionic membrane currents in muscle fibres from the tibia, but L-glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular synapse induces fast activation of an inward current when the membrane potential is voltage clamped close to its resting value. Instead of undergoing desensitization as is the case in many other preparations, a component of this glutamate-activated current has a sustained component, the reversal potential of which is close to 0 mV, as demonstrated with voltage ramps. Future investigations will allow extensive pharmacological characterization of membrane ionic currents and excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle from honeybee, a useful insect that became a model to study many physiological phenomena and which plays a major role in plant pollination and in stability of environmental vegetal biodiversity.",Article,Scopus

Oral and topical octopamine treatments modulated aspects of dances related to resource profitability in a dose-dependent manner. Dances for pollen and sucrose responded similarly to octopamine treatment, and these effects were eliminated by treatment with the octopamine antagonist mianserin. We propose that octopamine modulates the representation of floral rewards in dances by changing the processing of reward in the honey bee brain. Octopamine is known to modulate appetitive behavior in a range of solitary insects; the role of octopamine in dance provides an example of how neural substrates can be adapted for new behavioral innovations in the process of social evolution. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Article,Scopus

Individual bees were genotyped at 8 microsatellite loci and genic and genotypic analyses applied to examine genetic structure among burn patch localities, within burn patches, and within colonies. Despite relatively short-term availability of nesting substrates, remarkably fine-scale genetic structure was observed both among burn patches and within burn patches. The spatial distribution of relatedness shows a strong pattern of isolation-by-distance at geographic distances to 35 km, suggesting that genetic partitioning among burn patches is, at least in part, a result of dispersal ability. Genetic structure within burn patches includes colonies consisting of close kin with genic partitioning among nests.

What can flower visitors such as bees do to optimize their foraging routes, that is, reduce return time or route distance? Some repeatedly visit a set of plants in a significantly predictable sequence (so-called ""trapline foraging""), which may also enhance their foraging efficiency. A moderate level of optimization and repetition of foraging routes can be reached by following simple movement rules for choosing the distances and turning angles of successive flights, without the use of spatial memory. If pollinators can learn the locations of patches and choose among possible foraging routes or paths, however, even better performance may be achieved. We tested whether and how bumble bees can optimize and repeat their foraging routes in laboratory experiments with artificial flowers that secreted nectar at a constant rate. With increasing experience, foraging routes of bees became more repeatable and efficient than expected from a combination of simple movement rules between successive flowers. We suggest that trapline foraging is a more sophisticated pattern of spatial use than searching and is based on memory. On the other hand, certain spatial configurations of flowers hampered optimization by the bees; bees preferred to choose short distances over straight moves and showed little plasticity in this regard. Developing an efficient trapline, therefore, may require prior selection of a set of plants with an appropriate spatial configuration. © The Author 2006.

Male and female blueberry bees were recorded foraging on a wide range of plants in urban, suburban, and rural areas for both pollen and nectar. Female bees collected pollen from five genera in four families. Pollen on male and female bees collected on either Vaccinium or Gelsemium was predominantly from the species from which it was collected, but many specimens had both pollen types present. There were significant differences in foraging preferences among the three plant species and between gender. Overall, females preferred Gelsemium to Vaccinium, but males showed the opposite pattern. For both females and males, Azalea was the least preferred. Variation in the local abundance of flowers among the sites was not related to foraging preference. The foraging patterns of H. laboriosa in the landscape of human modified ecosystems suggests that H. laboriosa may be a mesolectic bee, using pollen from a few unrelated species, as opposed to a narrow oligolege (using pollen from only a few related species of Vaccinium).

It is important to understand the pollination processes that generate landscape-scale gene dispersal in plants, particularly in crop plants with genetically modified (GM) varieties. In one such crop, Brassica napus, the situation is complicated by uncertainty over the relative importance of two pollen vectors, wind and insects. 2. We investigated pollination in two fields of B. napus that bloomed at different times of year (April vs. July) and attracted different abundances of foraging social bees. Rates of pollen transfer were quantified by counting the pollen grains deposited on stigmas and remaining in the anthers at intervals after flower opening. 3. Flowers open in April were adequately pollinated only after 5 days and only 10% received even a single bee visit. Flowers open in July received three bee visits per hour and were fully pollinated within 3 h. 4. Based on published measurements of airborne pollen dispersal, we estimate that wind-pollination from a hypothetical field 1 km distant could have fertilized up to 0.3% of the field's seed when bees were scarce in April but only up to 0.007% when bees were abundant in July. 5. The efficiency of pollination (the proportion of pollen released from anthers that landed on receptive stigmas) was seven times greater in July (1.5%) than in April (0.2%). The relatively high efficiency of insect pollination may help to explain the evolutionary maintenance of entomophily. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results begin to resolve a long-standing inconsistency among previous studies by suggesting that the susceptibility of fields of B. napus to long-distance cross-pollination by wind depends on the level of bee activity.

In a first step to understanding what this role might be, the morphology and physiological optics of ocelli were investigated in three tropical rainforest species - the nocturnal sweat bee Megalopta genalis, the nocturnal paper wasp Apoica pallens and the diurnal paper wasp Polistes occidentalis - using hanging-drop techniques and standard histological methods. Ocellar image quality, in addition to lens focal length and back focal distance, was determined in all three species. During flight, the ocellar receptive fields of both nocturnal species are centred very dorsally, possibly in order to maximise sensitivity to the narrow dorsal field of light that enters through gaps in the rainforest canopy. Since all ocelli investigated had a slightly oval shape, images were found to be astigmatic: images formed by the major axis of the ocellus were located further from the proximal surface of the lens than images formed by the minor axis. Despite being astigmatic, images formed at either focal plane were reasonably sharp in all ocelli investigated. When compared to the position of the retina below the lens, measurements of back focal distance reveal that the ocelli of Megalopta are highly underfocused and unable to resolve spatial detail. This together with their very large and tightly packed rhabdoms suggests a role in making sensitive measurements of ambient light intensity. In contrast, the ocelli of the two wasps form images near the proximal boundary of the retina, suggesting the potential for modest resolving power. In light of these results, possible roles for ocelli in nocturnal bees and wasps are discussed, including the hypothesis that they might be involved in nocturnal homing and navigation, using two main cues: the spatial pattern of bright patches of daylight visible through the rainforest canopy, and compass information obtained from polarised skylight (from the setting sun or the moon) that penetrates these patches. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

African and European honeybees (EHB) hybridize, but with time, tropical and subtropical American environments have become dominated by AHB that exhibit only 20-35% genetic contribution from western European bees, and a predominance of African behavioral and physiological traits. EHB persist in temperate environments. Clines between AHB and EHB exist in ecotones of South and Central America, and are forming in North America. What individual-level genetic, behavioral and physiological traits determine the relative success of the AHB as an invader in the neotropics, and of the EHB in temperate areas? Preference for pollen versus nectar may be an important trait mediating these ecological trade-offs, as preference for pollen enhances nutrient intake and brood production for the AHB in the tropics, while a relative preference for nectar enhances honey stores and winter survival for EHB. AHB exhibit morphological (higher thorax-to-body mass ratios) and physiological (higher thorax-specific metabolic rates) traits that may improve flight capacity, dispersal, mating success and foraging intake. Enhanced winter longevity, linked with higher hemolymph vitellogenin levels, may be a key factor improving winter survival of EHB. Data from South America and distributions of AHB in the southwestern United States suggest that AHB-EHB hybrids will extend 200 km north of regions with a January maximal temperatures of 15-16°C. The formation of biotypic clines between AHB and EHB represents a unique opportunity to examine mechanisms responsible for the range limit of invaders. © The Author 2006.

There is no evidence of colonization or foraging on the small and floristically impoverished islands of Salsipuedes, Rasa, Partida Norte, and San Pedro Mártir.

Social bees are our chosen study system because they provide a convenient and tractable biological system with which to study the potential adaptiveness of a wide range of foraging traits such as flower constancy, floral color preference, learning to associate floral color as a predictor of reward, traplining, and communication about food sources. This variety of behavioral traits allows us to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of applying five approaches (four experimental and one theoretical) to the study of foraging at the species, population, and colony level. (1) The comparative approach allows us to contrast behavioral traits of extant species with those of their common ancestor. We correlated differences in floral color preference between closely related species (and populations), with a known phylogeny, with features in each bee's respective environment. (2) Reciprocal transplant experiments allowed us to test for local adaptation. We compared the relative foraging performance of distinct bee populations in both of their respective native environments. (3) Manipulating the foraging environment to eliminate specific behavioral traits permitted a direct comparison of animals' foraging performance in their normal and experimentally manipulated environment, allowing us to quantify the effect of the trait in question (traplining) on foraging performance. (4) Manipulating the foraging phenotype to eliminate specific behavioral traits is another valuable approach. Unless suitable behavioral mutants, knockouts, or molecular techniques to selectively block gene expression are available, creating such artificial foraging phenotypes is only possible for a very small number of specific traits, for example, the honeybee dance language. (5) Integrating biologically realistic modeling with experimental studies allows us to test predictions about the adaptive significance of foraging-related traits not amenable to experimental manipulation and to identify the ranges over which these traits might affect fitness. Do these approaches provide evidence that foraging behaviors are adaptive? In some cases, we show that forager behavior has indeed been tuned to function adaptively in a given niche, although the adaptive benefits of such behavioral traits are often strongly context dependent. However, in other cases, the observed patterns of behavior were more parsimoniously explained by chance evolutionary processes, or by the historical conditions under which bees operated in their evolutionary past. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In honey bees and stingless bees, the thoracic temperature of feeding foragers is correlated with the caloric value of sucrose solution provided at feeders outside the nest. We provide the first detailed data showing that this phenomenon also occurs in the closely related bumble bee and thus may be homologous in all social bees of the Apidae. Using infrared thermography, we measured Tth for Bombus wilmattae foragers (mass 0.17±0.11 g, length 15.0±1.5 mm) from six wild colonies, foraging on a range of sucrose concentrations (0.5-2.5 mol l -1, 16-65% by mass) in foraging arenas. For all colonies, we measured significant increases in ΔTth (P&lt;0.0001) with increasing sucrose concentration, with significant differences (P&lt;0.0001) between colonies due to different linear regression slopes (0.28-2.4) and y-intercepts (2.7-5.5).

The bees' task was to locate the reward in the arm of the Y-choice apparatus, where a black pattern on a white background was displayed in one arm versus a white target in the other arm, at a range of 27 cm. The alternative patterns for the training included previously identified cues. They were: an oblique bar, three parallel oblique bars, an oblique grating, a square cross, six spokes, a large or a small spot, a spotty modulation, or a ring. The trained bees were given a variety of interleaved tests to discover the labels they had used to identify the patterns. A label is defined as the coincidence of cues that contributed to the recognition of a single landmark. The bees learned, firstly, the black area at the expected place, secondly, modulation caused by edges at the expected place. These cues were quantified and always available. In addition, the orientation cue was learned from a grating that covered the target, but was ignored in a single bar. The bees learned the positions of the centres of black and of radial symmetry. In tests, they also recognized unfamiliar cues that were not displayed in the training. The cues and preferences were similar to those used to discriminate between two targets.

The widespread distribution of this orchid species (or species complex) suggests that there may be a number of different model and pollinator species throughout this range, and that additional studies are necessary to characterise its pollination adequately. In this study, the pollination of D. maculata in the Sydney region, mainly at Scheyville National Park, was compared with the results previously obtained in Victoria. At Scheyville National Park, Trichocolletes venustus was the only native bee species found in significant numbers, and the flowers it visited were almost exclusively the legumes Hardenbergia violacea and Daviesia ulicifolia ssp. ulicifolia. Fifty per cent (14 of 28) of captured male bees carried D. maculata orchid pollinaria, or remnants, which were identified by AFLP fingerprinting. Female bees, which appeared about 10?14 days after males, were not observed visiting the orchid or carrying orchid pollinaria. We confirmed that D. maculata flowers lack nectar, and noted that the pea-like flowers possess an UV false nectar guide comparable to the true UV nectar guide of the legume flowers. Colorimetric analysis showed the colour separation between D. ulicifolia ssp. ulicifolia and the orchid is small enough to be likely to produce foraging errors, consistent with mimicry. We conclude that guild mimicry of a diversity of 'egg and bacon' legumes best explains the pollination of D. maculata s.l., rather than precise mimicry of any one pea species. Preliminary observations suggest that pea-flower mimicry may range from being highly precise in some species, through to being much more generalised, but still retaining elements of mimicry. The novel finding of comparable UV patterns in Diuris species and putative pea models applies to most species in the genus and we found that the rare D. aequalis shows remarkable similarity in colour, shape and UV patterns to the sympatric legume Gompholobium huegelii, and is likely to be a mimic of this species. © CSIRO 2006.",Article,Scopus

Compared to the known ground-nesting visitors to crops, bee community nesting on farms was depauperate. Further, more abundant and diverse communities of bees were found nesting at farms with patches of natural habitat near by than farms that were far away from natural habitat. Species responded differently to soil conditions created by farming practices, but the variability in nesting bee abundance was lower in farms near natural habitat than farms far from natural habitat. These findings suggest that most bee species are affected adversely but to varying degrees by agricultural intensification, and that natural habitats may buffer against the bee population variability in agricultural landscape.

Twentieth Century changes in range and frequency of these forage plants were assessed using data from the New Atlas of the British and Irish Flora (1930-1969 to 1987-1999) and the Countryside Surveys of Britain (1978-1998). Forage plants declined in both large-scale range and local-scale frequency between the two survey periods. These changes were of greater magnitude than changes in other native plant species, reflecting serious reductions in quality of foraging habitats for bees as well as a general decline in insect-pollinated plants. Seventy-six percent of forage plants declined in frequency within 1-km squares, including those (e.g. Trifolium pratense) of particular value for threatened bumblebee species.

Few studies, however, have so far examined their joint effects in natural populations. In this paper we evaluate the influence of flower damage and pollination by the hummingbird Oreotrochilus leucopleurus on the fecundity of the Andean monkey flower Mimulus luteus. We performed a 2x2 factorial experiment, with artificial clipping of lower petals and selective exclusion of the hummingbird as main factors. In spite of the relatively low proportion (27.5%) of the variance in seed production accounted for by the full factorial model, artificial damage and hummingbird exclusion, as well as their interaction, were highly significant, indicating nonadditive effects of factors on plant fecundity. In the presence of hummingbirds, undamaged flowers had a seed production that was 1.7-fold higher than for damaged flowers, suggesting that the effect of flower damage on female reproductive success occurs probably as a consequence of hummingbird discrimination against damaged corollas. This result indicates that the impact of flower herbivory on plant fecundity was contingent on the presence or absence of hummingbirds, suggesting that pollinators may indirectly select for undamaged and probably resistant flower phenotypes. A second interaction effect revealed that undamaged flowers produced 78.5% more seeds in the absence of rather than in the presence of O. leucopleurus, raising the question of the ecological mechanism involved. We suggest that the strong territorial behavior exhibited by the bee Centris nigerrima may confine the foraging activities of the remaining bee species to safe sites within exclosures. Overall, our results provide evidence that hummingbird pollination and flower herbivory have interdependent effects on M. luteus fecundity, which indicates that it will be difficult to predict their ecological and evolutionary consequences unless interactions are analyzed in an integrated form. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",Article,Scopus

It appears to allow them to decide between at least two goals in the field, and to steer towards them over considerable distances. Two models concerning the structure of bees' spatial memory are developed from new empirical evidence. The first one relies on the integration of at least two flight vectors, while the second assumes the existence of a 'functional' map based on the information available on-site. These findings also raise questions about the process of encoding and decoding information in the context of the waggle dance. We review published data and recent evidence indicating that memories of topographical features might also be involved in dance communication, and point out what needs to be addressed to elucidate the corresponding memory demands.

Returning tests of foragers released at some distance of the hive confirmed that infested bees take longer time to return or do not return at all. The loss of foragers per flight was higher in a highly infested colony compared to a less infested colony. In a visual orientation test at the hive entrance infested bees scored lower, indicating impaired orientation abilities.

Fieldwork was carried out in 1999 and 2000 on Mount Carmel, in northern Israel, a known hot-spot for bee diversity. Habitats with a range of post-burn ages and varying intensities of cattle grazing were surveyed by transect recording, grazing levels, and the diversity and abundance of both flowers and bees were measured. The species richness of both bees and flowers were highest at moderate to high grazing intensities, and path-analysis indicated that the effects of both grazing and fire on bee diversity were mediated mainly through changes in flower diversity, herb flowers being more important than shrubs. The abundance of bees increased with intensified grazing pressure even at the highest levels surveyed. Surprisingly though, changes in bee abundance at high grazing levels were not caused directly by changes in flower cover. The variation in bee abundance may have been due to higher numbers of solitary bees from the family Halictidae in grazed sites, where compacted ground (nesting resource) and composites (forage resource) were abundant. The effects of grazing on plants were clearest in the intermediate-aged sites, where cattle inhibited the growth of some of the dominant shrubs, creating or maintaining more open patches where light-demanding herbs could grow, thus allowing a diverse flora to develop. Overall, bee communities benefit from a relatively high level of grazing in phrygana. Although bee and flower diversity may decrease under very heavy grazing, the present levels of grazing on Mount Carmel appear to have only beneficial effects on the bee community. © OIKOS.",Article,Scopus

Yet few studies have evaluated invasion effects using multiple, simultaneously applied monitoring and experimental approaches, in order to compare easily obtained metrics with more difficult but direct measures of reproductive success or population dynamics. In this study, I use data from an experimental test of introduced honey bee (Apis mellifera) impacts on native bumble bees (Bombus spp.) to address two major questions: 1) how well did observational data on niche overlap and spatial correlations between Apis and Bombus predict the results of experimental tests of competitive effects? and 2) how well did effects of the experimental Apis manipulations on Bombus foragers, which are easy to observe, predict changes in reproductive success of colonies, which are difficult to measure? Niche overlap between Apis and Bombus varied substantially, but increased to levels as high as 80-90% during periods of resource scarcity. Correlations between numbers of Apis foragers and numbers of Bombus foragers were also highly variable, but I detected a significant negative relationship in only one of the seven months observed. In contrast, the experimental results showed that mean numbers of Bombus foragers observed on a given transect increased significantly with greater distance from introduced Apis colonies. Of these three measures (niche overlap, correlations in abundances, and effects of experimental introductions), only the experimental data on forager abundances accurately estimated competitive effects on colony reproductive success previously reported for the same experiment, and the correlational data in particular completely failed to predict the effects observed in the experimental study. This work suggests that great caution is warranted in making assessments of invasion impact on the basis of spatial or temporal correlations between invasive and native species. Thus, investing in even small and limited experimental studies may be more valuable than extensive observational work in quantifying invasion impacts. © OIKOS.",Article,Scopus

Potential ecological consequences of invasion of non-native pollinators include increased pollination and seed set of invasive plants, with subsequent impacts on population growth rates and rates of spread. We outline a quantitative approach for evaluating the impact of a proposed introduction of an invasive pollinator on existing weed population dynamics and demonstrate the use of this approach on a relatively data-rich case study: the impacts on Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) from proposed introduction of Bombus terrestris. Three models have been used to assess population growth (matrix model), spread speed (integrodifference equation), and equilibrium occupancy (lattice model) for C. scoparius. We use available demographic data for an Australian population to parameterize two of these models. Increased seed set due to more efficient pollination resulted in a higher population growth rate in the density-independent matrix model, whereas simulations of enhanced pollination scenarios had a negligible effect on equilibrium weed occupancy in the lattice model. This is attributed to strong microsite limitation of recruitment in invasive C. scoparius populations observed in Australia and incorporated in the lattice model. A lack of information regarding secondary ant dispersal of C. scoparius prevents us from parameterizing the integrodifference equation model for Australia, but studies of invasive populations in California suggest that spread speed will also increase with higher seed set. For microsite-limited C. scoparius populations, increased seed set has minimal effects on equilibrium site occupancy. However, for density-independent rapidly invading populations, increased seed set is likely to lead to higher growth rates and spread speeds. The impacts of introduced pollinators on native flora and fauna and the potential for promoting range expansion in pollinator-limited 'sleeper weeds' also remain substantial risks. © 2006 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

Females of Dawson's burrowing bees vary in body weight over a twofold range. Despite the potential for differences in body weight to affect several aspects of the competition among nesting females, no clear advantages were documented for larger females. 2. Nesting females were not consistently larger than emerging females, nor was there a consistent relationship between body size and the weight of pollen and nectar carried to the nest on provisioning trips. At one nesting location, larger females did not produce larger pre-pupal offspring nor did they produce offspring at a faster rate than their smaller nesting companions. 3. In addition, large body size was not associated with greater success in nest defence despite the fact that nesting females regularly encountered intruders in their burrows. Residency, not body size, determined the outcome of almost all contests for control of a nest burrow. The absence of a large body size effect here appears to stem from an intruder strategy designed to enable nest-searching females to acquire burrows that had been abandoned through death or dispersal of their original owners rather than securing existing nests through an aggressive takeover strategy. 4. Thus, although large body size conveys significant fitness advantages to males, this attribute does not promote female success in either provisioning or defending their nests. © 2006 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

However, local resource partitioning does not fully explain the species diversity of bumblebee communities. Theoretical studies provide new evidence that partitioning of space can promote species coexistence, when species interact with their environment at different spatial scales. If bumblebee species possess specific foraging ranges, different spatial resource utilisation patterns might operate as an additional mechanism of coexistence in bumblebee communities. We investigated the effects of the landscape-wide availability of different resources (mass flowering crops and semi-natural habitats) on the local densities of four bumblebee species at 12 spatial scales (landscape sectors with 250-3,000 m radius) to indirectly identify the spatial scales at which the bumblebees perceive their environment. The densities of all bumblebee species were enhanced in landscapes with high proportions of mass flowering crops (mainly oilseed rape). We found the strongest effects for Bombus terrestris agg. and Bombus lapidarius at large spatial scales, implying foraging distances of 3,000 and 2,750 m, respectively. The densities of Bombus pascuorum were most strongly influenced at a medium spatial scale (1,000 m), and of Bombus pratorum (with marginal significance) at a small spatial scale (250 m). The estimated foraging ranges tended to be related to body and colony sizes, indicating that larger species travel over larger distances than smaller species, presumably enabling them to build up larger colonies through a better exploitation of food resources. We conclude that coexistence in bumblebee communities could potentially be mediated by species-specific differences in the spatial resource utilisation patterns, which should be considered in conservation schemes. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",Article,Scopus

Based on field observations and herbarium data a report is made on its pollination, morph frequencies, pollen viability, seed set and chromosome number. In addition, a new chromosome count for the species in Africa is provided. • Methods: Field observations were conducted in six provinces in south-east China. Flower visitors were recorded and nectar sugar was measured with a refractometer. The species' compatibility system was determined by carrying out experimental self- and cross-pollinations on bagged inflorescences. Stigma receptivity and pollen viability was determined using the MTT test. • Key Results and Conclusions: Populations of O. debilis in China contain either the mid-style-length morph or the short morph, but not both. Pollination is by nectar- and pollen-foraging bees; pollen viability is low; and seed set in natural and experimentally self- or cross-pollinated flowers is extremely low. Chromosome counts indicate that O. debilis contains diploid and tetraploid forms in its native as well as introduced range, which does not support a previous hypothesis that the predominant vegetative reproduction in this species is an escape from pentaploidy. © The Author 2006.

A model was built using attractivity and productivity formulae based upon the flowering periods, the distances to the apiary, and the density and specific nectar productivity of the floral species surrounding the apiary. Honey harvests of 12 apiaries in Wallonie, Belgium (Fig. 1), were recorded from 1998 to 2000. The plant species, location and absolute percentage of cover of nectar-producing (melliferous) plants within a radius of two km of each apiary were surveyed during the summer 2000. These data were encoded and geo-referenced with a Geographical Information System (GIS). This software used tables containing data from field survey and the theoretical melliferous potentials of encountered plants (Tab. I). The model brought out the listing of foraged flowers and their potential honey productivity during flowering periods for each foraging area studied (e.g. Fig. 3). The predictions of honey production (kg/hive/year) were compared to the actual production and the model explained 60% of the variance of the observations (F1,10 = 37.76; P &lt; 0.001; r2 = 0.60; Fig. 2). Some tests of the sensitivity of the results to changing parameters showed the importance of a minimal 2-km radius to model the foraging range (Tab. II). Taking into account landscape diversity, the abundance of areas containing dense melliferous flora was also essential. This work improves our understanding of the melliferous value of the landscape around an apiary. This model represents an interesting tool for beekeepers that would like to evaluate the potential honey production of an area and represents progress in the cartography of regional beekeeping potential. © INRA/DIB-AGIB/ EDP Sciences, 2006.",Review,Scopus

A survey was undertaken to understand clonal effects on fine-scale genetic structure (FSGS) in two populations (one from a disturbed and the other from an undisturbed locality) of Echinosophora koreensis, an endangered small shrub belonging to a monotypic genus in central Korea that reproduces both sexually and vegetatively via rhizomes. • Methods: Using inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) as genetic markers, the spatial distribution of individuals was evaluated using Ripley's L(d)-statistics and quantified the spatial scale of clonal spread and spatial distribution of ISSR genotypes using spatial autocorrelation analysis techniques (join-count statistics and kinship coefficient, Fij) for total samples and samples excluding clones. • Key Results: A high degree of differentiation between populations was observed (ΦST(g) = 0.184, P &lt; 0.001). Ripley's L(d)-statistics revealed a near random distribution of individuals in a disturbed population, whereas significant aggregation of individuals was found in an undisturbed site. The join-count statistics revealed that most clones significantly aggregate at ≤6-m interplant distance. The Sp statistic reflecting patterns of correlograms revealed a strong pattern of FSGS for all four data sets (Sp = 0.072-0.154), but these patterns were not significantly different from each other. At small interplant distances (≤2 m), however, jackknifed 95 % CIs revealed that the total samples exhibited significantly higher Fij values than the same samples excluding clones. • Conclusion: The strong FSGS from genets is consistent with two biological and ecological traits of E. koreensis: bee-pollination and limited seed dispersal. Furthermore, potential clone mates over repeated generations would contribute to the observed high Fij values among genets at short distance. To ensure long-term ex situ genetic variability of the endangered E. koreensis, individuals located at distances of 10-12 m should be collected across entire populations of E. koreensis. © The Author 2006.

Sex related differences in foraging efficiency may also affect their probability to act as pollinators. In some major genera of solitary bees, males can be identified from a distance enabling a comparative foraging-behavior study.

Males and females harvested equal nectar amounts but males spent less time in each flower increasing their foraging efficiency at this scale. The overall average visit frequencies of females and males was 27.2 and 21.6 visits per flower per minute respectively. Females flew shorter distances increasing their visit frequency, relative foraging efficiency and their probability to pollinate. The proportion of conspecific pollen was higher on females, indicating higher floral constancy and pollination probability. The longer flights of males increase their probability to cross-pollinate.

Twenty-one of these bee species restrict their pollen foraging to L. tridentata. To evaluate the response of this bee fauna to fragmentation, we compared species incidence and abundance patterns for the bee guild visiting L. tridentata at 59 habitat fragments of known size (0.002-5 ha) and age (up to 70 years), and in adjacent desert. The 62 bee species caught during this study responded to fragmentation heterogeneously and not in direct relation to their abundance or incidence in undisturbed desert. Few species found outside the city were entirely absent from urban fragments. Species of ground-nesting L. tridentata specialists were underrepresented in smaller fragments and less abundant in the smaller and older fragments. In contrast, cavity-nesting bees (including one L. tridentata specialist) were overrepresented in the habitat fragments, probably due to enhanced nesting opportunities available in the urban matrix. Small-bodied bee species were no more likely than larger bodied species to be absent from the smaller fragments. The introduced European honey bee, Apis mellifera, was a minor faunal element at >90% of the fragments and exerted little if any influence on the response of native bee species to fragmentation. Overall, bee response to urban habitat fragmentation was best predicted by ecological traits associated with nesting and dietary breadth. Had species been treated as individual units in the analyses, or pooled together into one analysis, these response patterns may not have been apparent.

We examined the effectiveness of strategies to achieve this, including sowing seed mixtures of (1) tussocky grass species, (2) wildflowers and (3) pollen- and nectar-rich plants. These were compared to conventionally managed cereal crops. Sampling was undertaken in 32 10 × 10 km squares throughout England, each containing a sample of the different field margin types. Bumblebee abundance in July and August was significantly higher on pollen and nectar margins (86 ± 14 bees per 100 m) compared with wildflower margins (43 ± 14), mature grass margins (6 ± 14) and recently sown grass margins (8 ± 4). Bees were virtually absent from the cereal crop (0.2 ± 0.1). Bumblebee species richness was significantly higher on margins sown with either wildflowers or the pollen and nectar mix. There was evidence that richness of the bumblebee assemblage at the 10 × 10 km square scale was positively correlated with land use heterogeneity, the proportion of grassland, and the abundance and richness of dicotyledon flowers. The abundance of long-tongued bees per margin was explained by the number of pollen and nectar agreements per 10 × 10 km square, together with flower abundance.

However, many of these studies were conducted in the laboratory or under artificial conditions. We investigated the role of the wax combs in nestmate recognition in the natural context of bees at colony entrances. Wax combs constructed by each experimental colony were swapped between hives and the acceptance of nestmate and non-nestmate forager workers was recorded before and after the swap, and in relation to a control hive not involved in the swap. We conducted the experiment twice, in consecutive years with three different colonies each time. Colonies that exchanged combs became more accepting of each other's workers than of workers from the third colony. The overall acceptance of comb swap non-nestmates increased significantly from 3% before the swap to 23% after the swap in the first year, and from 8 to 47% in the second year. This effect wore off within 3 weeks. Chemical analyses showed that the cuticular profile of non-nestmates involved in the experimental comb swap became more similar to each other after the swap, and that acceptance by guards of bees from different hives was negatively correlated with chemical distance between the hydrocarbon profiles of the workers from different hives. © 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

While performing this kind of long-distance path integration they must rely on external cues to adjust for navigational errors. Many external cues which could be used by the spiders change dramatically or disappear altogether in the transition period from day to night. Hence, it is therefore imperative to know exactly when after sunset the spiders navigate in order to find out how they do it. To explore this question, we monitored their locomotor activity with data loggers equipped with infrared beam sensors. Our results show that the male spiders are most active in the period between the end and the beginning of the astronomical twilight period. Moreover, they prefer the moonless, i.e. darkest times at night. Hence, we conclude that the males are truly - and extremely - nocturnal. We further show that they are able to navigate under the very dim light conditions prevailing on moonless nights, and thus do not have to rely on the moon or on moon-related patterns of polarised light as potential compass cues. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",Article,Scopus

Trillium tschonoskii is the most wide-ranging species among Asiatic Trillium, ranging from southern Sakhalin, the Japanese Islands (excepting Kyushu) to the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan and further to inland China and the Himalayas. The ecological range of T. tschonoskii is broad, extending from lowland forests to montane and further to subalpine mixed forests consisting of conifers and subalpine birch, Betula ermani. This species is a typical polycarpic perennial, similar to all other Japanese Trillium species, and flowers in early to late April in lowland populations and in mid-June to early July in subalpine habitats. Trillium tschonoskii typically has three white petals and three sepals, and its pollinators are diverse, for example, flies, beetles and bees such as Scatophagiae (Diptera), Oedemera lucidicollis (Coleoptera) and Andrena sp. (Hymenoptera). Pollen/ovule ratios of T. tschonoskii are approximately 700, thus T. tschonoskii is potentially an inbreeder. Seed outputs per plant are variable, 29-190 (mean 85.0) in 1980, and 28-168 (mean 79.8) in 1984. Seeds with a large soft juicy elaiosome attract ants, which are effective dispersal agents, but nocturnal elaiosome predators, mainly ground beetles, are also very active. Our long-term observations indicate that it takes approximately 10 years to reach a sexually mature stage and the life expectancy of mature plants is assumed to be exceedingly long, extending over 40 years. © 2006 The Authors.",Article,Scopus

Changing sex allocation because of changing payoffs may result from different ecological situations, such as foraging conditions. We investigated the impact of foraging travel cost on relative investment in sons vs daughters. Field studies were carried out with the central-place-foraging leafcutter bee Megachile rotundata (Fabricius), which has smaller males than females. Therefore, less investment is required to produce a viable son compared with a daughter. We found that with increased flight distance to resources, females produced a greater proportion of sons.

The mean numbers of pollen grains observed on the stigma in the W was lower than in the CSO. Pollinators in the CSO moved longer distances, flying among inflorescences rather than staying within the same inflorescence.

This, in turn, could increase fitness by reducing inbreeding depression in progeny and promoting pollen export. The few previous investigations of this hypothesis have all involved bee-pollinated orchids and some have given contradictory results. We studied the effects of adding artificial nectar (sucrose solution) to the spurs of a non-rewarding long-proboscid fly-pollinated orchid, Disa pulchra. Addition of nectar significantly increased the number of flowers probed by flies (2.6-fold), the time spent on a flower (5.4-fold), the number of pollinia removed per inflorescence (4.8-fold) and the proportion of removed pollen involved in self-pollination (3.5-fold). The level of self-pollination increased dramatically with the number of flowers probed by flies. Experimental self-pollination resulted in fruits with only half as many viable seeds as those arising from cross-pollination. Pollinators were more likely to fly long distances (>40 cm) when departing from non-rewarding inflorescences than when departing from rewarding ones.

One strategy for efficient foraging used by bumblebees is near-far search, involving short flights when in good patches of flowers and longer flights when in poor patches. Bumblebees also demonstrate the use of a spatial memory strategy by returning repeatedly to patches of flowers, and even following the same route between flowers, over periods of days. We attempted to determine at what spatial scales bumblebees use spatial memory while foraging within a patch and after how many flower visits spatial memory outweighs near-far search. Bumblebees in the laboratory foraged on a 4 X 4 array of artificial flowers with distances ranging from 10 to 80 cm between flowers in two simple spatial patterns. The proportion of visits to flowers containing a sucrose reward was monitored for either 100 or 400 flower visits in two separate experiments, after which the locations of the rewarding and nonrewarding flowers were interchanged, producing a mirror image. A drop in accuracy after the mirror image switch would indicate that the bees had memorized the location of rewarding flowers. Mirror image tests, and comparisons to a simulation model of near-far search based on actual flight distances, indicate that naive bumblebees used near-far search on flowers 10 cm apart but increasingly used spatial memory as experience and spatial separation increased. Bumblebees thus have multiple tactics available to forage efficiently in different environments. © The Author 2005.

To determine the landscape characteristics that facilitate the occurrence of B. muscorum, grid-based observation records were analysed in a GIS environment at a regional scale. A significantly negative effect of the number of trees on the occurrence of B. muscorum and a significantly positive one of the proportion of arable land, strongly support the species' preference for open landscapes. Yet, apart from open landscapes additional landscape features were shown to be important. A significantly positive effect of ditches in the final model revealed the importance of this landscape element for the occurrence of B. muscorum. This finding was additionally supported by recordings of nest-searching queens, nests, and flower visits along dithes. The positive effects of clover and fallow land indicate the species' need for suitable food resources throughout the season. Because B. muscorum exhibits small foraging ranges, it is essential that landscape elements that provide nesting sites, foraging habitats and undisturbed hibernation structures are next to each other. The low numbers of individuals of B. muscorum recorded indicate that the supply of these habitat elements may have reached a critical threshold in the study region. © Springer 2006.",Article,Scopus

B terrestris was always the most flower constant, followed by B lapidarius, with B pascuorum the least flower constant species. These interspecific differences in flower constancy were related to foraging performance under field conditions near Würzburg, Germany in 1999 and 2001. B terrestris was more flower constant, and predominantly outperformed B lapidarius at collecting nectar in both years. As B terrestris is also the larger of these species, these data also support the idea that larger bees are more efficient at nectar foraging, i.e. they bring home more nectar per unit time. However B pascuorum, the least flower constant of the three species tested, was the most efficient of them at collecting nectar, collecting 50% more nectar than B terrestris per hour. Therefore flower constancy appears to be a relatively poor predictor of species foraging performance, which is likely to be influenced simultaneously by many other factors including worker body size, tongue length, and foraging range. © 2005 E.

Interestingly, the precision by which dancers transfer directional information is negatively correlated with the distance to the advertised food source. The 'tuned-error' hypothesis suggests that colonies benefit from this imprecision as it spreads recruits out over a patch of constant size irrespective of the distance to the advertised site. An alternative to the tuned-error hypothesis is that dancers are physically incapable of dancing with great precision for nearby sources. Here we revisit the tuned-error hypothesis by studying the change in dance precision with increasing foraging distance over relatively short distances while controlling for environmental influences. We show that bees indeed increase their dance precision with the increase in foraging distance. However, we also show that dances performed by swarm-scouts for a nearby (30 m) nest site, where there could be no benefit to imprecision, are either without or with only limited directional information. This result suggests that imprecision in dance communication is caused primarily by physical constraints in the ability of dancers to turn around quickly enough when the advertised site is nearby. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",Article,Scopus

We re-examine the phylogeny of this genus, using an expanded set of taxa from Madagascar and Malawi and additional sequence data, in order to determine the number of dispersals and the timeframe over which they occurred. Location: Africa, Madagascar, Malawi, Asia and Australia. Methods: One nuclear (EF-1α F2) and two mitochondrial (CO1 and Cyt b) gene regions were sequenced for 36 allodapine bee species (including members of the genera Braunsapis, Nasutapis, Allodape, Allodapula, and Macrogalea) and one ceratinine species (Ceratina japonica). We used Bayesian analyses to examine phylogenetic structure and a penalized likelihood approach to estimate approximate ages for key divergences in our phylogeny. Results: Our analyses indicate a tropical African origin for Braunsapis in the early Miocene followed by very early dispersal into Asia and then a subsequent dispersal, following Asian diversification, into Australia during the late Miocene. There have also been two dispersals of Braunsapis from Africa to Madagascar and this result, when combined with phylogenetic and biogeographical data for other allodapines, suggests that these bees have the ability to cross moderately large ocean expanses. These dispersals may have been aided by the West Wind Drift, but rafting across the Mozambique Channel is also possible, and could be aided by the existence of developmental stages that require minimal or no feeding and by tolerance to sea water and spume. Accumulating evidence suggests that many biogeographical patterns in the southern hemisphere may be better explained by dispersal than by Gondwanan vicariance hypotheses. Our results add to this growing body of data and raise the possibility that some puzzling trans-Indian Ocean distributions may also be explained by historical dispersal events across oceanic barriers that now seem insuperable. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Article,Scopus

The results for this absolute conditioning function and a previously determined function for differential conditioning were compared, and it is shown that the absolute conditioning function best explains the discrimination and flower constancy behaviour of bees that has previously been observed in natural settings. Modeling of the empirically determined absolute discrimination function allows for predictions of how bees would discriminate between flowers in complex foraging conditions that might include changes in the background and/or illumination colour. The absolute conditioning function should thus serve as an important guide for the evaluation of pollinator discriminations between flowers in natural settings, and for the understanding of why there may have been considerable evolutionary pressure on plants to evolve distinctive flower colours so as to promote flower constancy in important pollinators. © 2006 E.

Local community composition and the distribution of body size classes and trophic guilds were most affected by regional processes, which highly confounded landscape and local factors. After correcting for regional effects, factors at the landscape scale dominated over local habitat factors. Land-use intensity explained most of the variability in species data, whereas landscape characteristics (especially connectivity) accounted for most of the variability in body size and trophic guilds. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that management effort should be focused on land-use intensity and habitat connectivity in order to enhance diversity in agricultural landscapes. Since these factors are largely independent, specific conservation programmes may be developed with regards to socio-economic and agri-environmental requirements. Changes in either of these factors will enhance diversity but will also result in specific effects on local communities related to dispersal ability and the resource use of species. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",Article,Scopus

In insects and other arthropods, the antennae are probably the most important part of this tactile sense. The paired insect antenna is regarded as a true, segmented limb arising from the cranium, although there is still some debate about the precise number of segments in the head of the Mandibulata (Crustacea, Myriapoda and Insecta; Schmidt-Ott and Technau, 1992; Schmidt-Ott et al., 1994; Damen et al., 1998; Abzhanov and Kaufman, 1999; Boyan and Williams, 2002). Hennig (1986) uses the name Antennata as a synonym for the Mandibulata, expressing the fact that this taxon comprises all living arthropod species with antennae. The most ancient arthropods, the extinct trilobites, also carried antennae, which is why the 1st pair of antennae is typically considered to be the first pair of limbs, i.e. articulated appendages, in the ground plan of all arthropods. Accordingly, the Chelicerata are thought to have secondarily lost their antennae. Within the Mandibulata, the Crustacea carry two pairs of antennae: the antennules (first pair) are appendages of the deutocerebral segment and are considered to be homologous to the insect antenna, whereas the second pair of antennae are the appendages of the so-called tritocerebral segment (Hennig, 1986; Brusca and Brusca, 1990; Telford and Thomas, 1998; Boyan et al., 2002). Insects have lost the second pair of antennae during evolution. Antennae are equipped with various types of mechanoreceptors, including large numbers of exteroreceptive sensory hairs, but also proprioreceptors such as internal chordotonal organs, external hair plates, and campaniform sensilla. Being moveable, the antennae can actively sample the space surrounding the animal, thus aiding the localisation of obstacles, recognition of conspecifics or predators, active tracking of objects, or probing of surface structures. Because both passive and active movements can occur during tactile sensing, the tactile sensory system requires integration of proprioreceptive and exteroreceptive information in order to locate the stimulus source. Moreover, self-induced sensory stimulation may have to be predicted from motor commands, and compared with the actual sensory input. Therefore, understanding the neurobiology of the tactile sense of insects and crustaceans requires an integrative view of the motor physiology and biomechanics on the one hand, and of the neurophysiology of the participating sensory and interneuronal structures on the other. In the light of this knowledge, the functional significance of the various system components can be interpreted for a range of natural behaviours. The last integrative view on insect antennae that included all known sensory modalities was given by Schneider (1964). Since then, much progress has been made, not only in the field of insect olfaction (e.g. Hansson, 1999) and the sensory physiology of mechanoreceptors (e.g. McIver, 1975, 1985; Zacharuk, 1985), but also in elucidating key components in tactile behaviours such as the localisation of obstacles or physical interactions in intraspecific communication. To illustrate this body of knowledge, and to extend and contrast the mentioned reports on mechanoreception, it is the aim of the present review to combine aspects of antennal biomechanics, mechanoreception, processing of tactile information, and the behavioural repertoire involving the antennal tactile sense. Each of these aspects will be treated in separate sections, concentrating on prominent animal model systems, such as the cockroach (mainly Periplaneta americana L. and Blaberus sp.), stick insect (Carausius morosus Br.), cricket (Gryllus sp., Teleogryllus sp. and Acheta domesticus L.), locust (Locusta migratoria L. and Schistocerca gregaria Forskål) and the honeybee (Apis mellifera L.). For comparison with a related animal group that employs very similar, though not homologous, organs in tactile sensing, we will expand our view on decapod crustaceans, notably crayfish and lobsters. Finally, we discuss the potential of active tactile sensing from a technical perspective, to point at a helpful mutual exchange between engineering and animal physiology. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent work suggests that bees measure distance flown in terms of the extent of image motion (integrated optic flow) that is experienced during flight. However, it is known that optic flow also regulates the speed of flight. Therefore, the duration of the flight to a destination is likely to co-vary with the optic flow that is experienced en route. This makes it difficult to tease apart the potential roles of flight duration and optic flow as cues in estimating distance flown. Here we examine whether flight duration alone can serve as an indicator of distance. We trained bees to visit feeders at two sites located in optically different environments, but positioned such that the flight durations to the two sites were similar. The distance estimates for the two sites, as reported in the waggle dance, were compared. We found that dances differed significantly between the two sites, even though flight times were similar. Flight time per se was a poor predictor of waggle dance behaviour. We conclude that foraging bees do not simply signal flight time as their measure of distance in the waggle dance; the environment through which they fly plays a dominant role. © Birkhäuser Verlag, 2005.",Article,Scopus

In one experiment, bees were trained to forage in an optic-flow-rich tunnel with a landmark positioned directly above the feeder. Subsequent food-search tests indicated that bees searched much more accurately when both odometric and landmark cues were available than when only odometry was available. When the two cue sources were set in conflict, by shifting the position of the landmark in the tunnel during test, bees overwhelmingly used landmark cues rather than odometry. In another experiment, odometric cues were removed by training and testing in axially striped tunnels. The data show that bees did not weight landmarks as highly as when odometric cues were available, tending to search in the vicinity of the landmark for shorter periods. A third experiment, in which bees were trained with odometry but without a landmark, showed that a novel landmark placed anywhere in the tunnel during testing prevented bees from searching beyond the landmark location. Two further experiments, involving training bees to relatively longer distances with a goal-defining landmark, produced similar results to the initial experiment. One caveat was that, with the removal of the familiar landmark, bees tended to overshoot the training location, relative to the case where bees were trained without a landmark. Taken together, the results suggest that bees assign appropriate significance to odometric and landmark cues in a more flexible and dynamic way than previously envisaged.",Article,Scopus

Several components of the waggle dance are correlated with the direction of and the distance to food. Moreover, recruits use the spatial information encoded in the dance to locate the signalled food. However, although dance communication has been studied extensively, little is known about how the dancers combine the compass (direction) and the odometric (distance) information they acquire during the foraging flight. In the present study, we analysed the encoding of spatial information in the waggle dance by manipulating the navigational information provided to dancing bees. To this end, we took advantage of the bees' visually driven odometer. We found that the waggle dance basically encodes information on the distance gauged during the outbound (hive-to-food) flight. However, it does not necessarily refer to a global vector based on path integration of the outbound flight. Whenever the direction connecting the subjective food location and the hive does not match the direction of the global vector, dancers refer to a direction close to that of the shortcut connecting the actual food location and the hive. Moreover, in our experiments, this direction was close to that of the inbound (food-to-hive) flight, indicating that landmark-based information is computed during the inbound flight and that it may strongly affect the encoding of directional information in the waggle dance. Moreover, we found that the bees' experience of the terrain modulates the encoding of spatial information in the waggle dance, suggesting that interactions between path integration and visual landmarks are computed in the context of dance communication.",Article,Scopus

Using infrared thermography, we found that Melipona panamica foragers elevated their thoracic temperature at profitable food sources (higher sucrose concentration, closer to the nest). At food sources, there is an increase of approximately 0.9°C in thoracic temperature (Tth) per 1 mol l-1 increase in sucrose concentration (at 20 m distance from nest: 1 mol l-1 sucrose concentration, Tth=36. 6±0.8°C, Ta=31.3±0.5°C; 2.5 mol l-1 sucrose concentration, Tth=36.9±0.6°C, T a=29.9±0.2°C).

They play an important role in sexual attraction, social behaviour and location of profitable food sources. Here, we were interested in the role of odours in orientation at short distance, for instance the approach flight to a floral patch or in close proximity to the hive entrance. Using a newly designed wind tunnel, we investigated the orientation behaviour of the bee towards two different odours: a social odour and a floral component, linalool. We then tested the effect of prior olfactory conditioning (conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex) on subsequent flight orientation. We showed that both stimuli induced orientated behaviour (orientated flights, circling around the odour source) in up to 70% of the worker bees, social odour being slightly more attractive than the linalool. We found thereafter that orientation performance towards the floral compound can be significantly enhanced by prior classical olfactory learning. This type of information transfer, from a Pavlovian associative context to an orientation task, might allow future foragers to acquire, within the hive, relevant information about the odours and food they will encounter during their later foraging bouts.",Article,Scopus

The best-studied communication behaviour in this context is the waggle dance performed by returning foragers, which encodes information about the distance and direction to the food source. It has been suggested that another information cue, floral scents transferred within the hive, is also important for recruitment to food sources, as bee recruits are more strongly attracted to odours previously brought back by foragers in both honeybees and bumble-bees. These observations suggested that honeybees learn the odour from successful foragers before leaving the hive. However, this has never been shown directly and the mechanisms and properties of the learning process remain obscure. We tested the learning and memory of recruited bees in the laboratory using the proboscis extension response (PER) paradigm, and show that recruits indeed learn the nectar odours brought back by foragers by associative learning and retrieve this memory in the PER paradigm. The associative nature of this learning reveals that information was gained during mouth-to-mouth contacts among bees (trophallaxis). Results further suggest that the information is transferred to long-term memory.

Variation in herkogamy during the life of individual flowers was also quantified. Multilocus outcrossing rates were estimated from plants differing in herkogamy using allozyme markers. • Key Results: Anther-stigma separation varied considerably among flowers within the six populations studied (range = 1-10 mm). This variation was nearly one order of magnitude larger than the slight, statistically non-significant developmental variation during the lifespan of individual flowers. Estimates of multilocus outcrossing rate for different herkogamy classes (tm range = 0.49-0.76) failed to reveal a monotonic increase with increasing herkogamy. • Conclusions: It is suggested that the lack of a positive relationship between herkogamy and outcrossing rate, a result that has not been previously documented for other species, could be mostly related to details of the foraging behaviour of pollinators. © The Author 2005.

We focused on its reproductive biology and pollinator behavior to explain its reproductive success. We performed manual pollination and germination experiments, and monitored the behavior of C. retusa's main pollinators in monospecific plots, and in mixed plots where C. retusa occurred together with two congeners, Crotalaria pallida and Crotalaria lanceolata. Crotalaria retusa is self-compatible and capable of automatic selfing. Inbreeding depression was expressed at the level of percent seed germination, but not seed set. Few insects visited the inflorescences. Legitimate pollinators were two large carpenter bees, Xylocopa frontalis and Xylocopa grisescens which, together, accounted for more than 90 percent of the visits. The former foraged on C. retusa exclusively and has low pollen spread potential. The latter flew longer distances between plants and visited fewer flowers per inflorescence, potentially increasing the extent of pollen carryover, but at the risk of increasing heterospecific pollen transfer, because it visits other Crotalaria species during the same foraging bout. The different foraging strategies, allied to morphological disadvantages represented by pollen overlap on X. grisescens' body, may partially explain the much lower seed germination observed in C. pallida and C. lanceolata. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a reduction in flower constancy may significantly depress viable seed set by increasing the chances of self-pollination.",Article,Scopus

We undertook a study over several years of a univoltine and communal bee, Andrena agilissima, and its main dipteran parasites, in particular the satellite fly Leucophora personata (Diptera: Anthomyiidae). Behavioural and ecological data were collected from one nesting aggregation of the host bee on the island of Elba, Italy, from 1993 to 2003, and from a foraging site of the bee, ca 5 km from the nesting aggregation. Other Diptera associated with A. agilissima at the field site were the bee fly Bombylius fimbriatus (Bombyliidae), the conopid fly Zodion cinereum (Conopidae), and the scuttle fly Megaselia andrenae (Phoridae). The phenology of the Diptera broadly overlapped with that of their host across the season of activity (end of April and all of May). Diurnal activity patterns differed slightly; L. personata in particular was active at the host's nesting site before A. agilissima. Female satellite flies also showed a range of behaviours in gaining entry to a host nest. We summarize published data on this and other Leucophora species that parasitize Andrena host bees. Host bees returning to their nests occasionally undertook zig-zag flight manoeuvres if followed by a satellite fly that were generally successful in evading the fly. Satellite flies that entered a nest, presumably to oviposit, were less likely to remain therein if another host bee entered the same nest, suggesting that one advantage to communal nesting for this host is a reduction in brood cell parasitism by L. personata. We provide the first clear evidence for parasitism by a Zodion of any Andrena host. Both L. personata and M. andrenae concentrated their parasitic activities in the zone of the host nesting aggregation with highest nest densities. Three of the Diptera, L. personata, B. fimbriatus, and Z. cinereum, seemed to have extremely low rates of parasitism whilst that of M. andrenae appeared low. Though they have refined parasitic behaviour that allows them to gain entry into host nests (L. personata, B. fimbriatus, and M. andrenae) or to parasitize adults (Z. cinereum), these parasites seem not to impact upon the dynamics of the host A. agilissima at the nesting aggregation, and the host possesses traits to reduce parasitism. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Thus, distinguishing the effects of clonal versus sexual individuals in population genetic analyses could provide important insights for evolutionary biology and conservation. To investigate the effects of clonal spread on the fine-scale spatial genetic structure within plant populations, Hosta jonesii (Liliaceae), an endemic species to Korea, was chosen as a study species. • Methods: Using allozymes as genetic markers, spatial autocorrelation analysis of ramets and of genets was conducted to quantify the spatial scale of clonal spread and genotype distribution in two populations of H. jonesii. • Key Results: Join-count statistics revealed that most clones are significantly aggregated at <3-m interplant distance. Spatial autocorrelation analysis of all individuals resulted in significantly higher Moran's I values at 0-3-m interplant distance than analyses of population samples in which clones were excluded. However, significant fine-scale genetic structure was still observed when clones were excluded. • Conclusions: These results suggest that clones enhance the magnitude of spatial autocorrelation due to localized clonal spread. The significant fine-scale genetic structure detected in samples excluding clones is consistent with the biological and ecological traits exhibited by H. jonesii including bee pollination and limited seed dispersal. For conservation purposes, genetic diversity would be maximized in local populations of H. jonesii by collecting or preserving individuals that are spaced at least 5 m apart. © The Author 2005.

The conservation of native honey bees, such as the European black bee (Apis mellifera mellifera), therefore, requires large isolated areas to prevent hybridisation with other subspecies, such as A. m. ligustica or A. m. carnica, which may have been introduced by beekeepers. This study used DNA microsatellite markers to determine the mating range of A. m. mellifera in two adjacent semi-isolated valleys (Edale and Hope Valley) in the Peak District National Park, England, in order to assess their suitability for native honey bee conservation and as isolated mating locations. Three apiaries were set up in each valley, each containing 12 colonies headed by a virgin queen and 2 queenright drone producing hives. The virgin queens were allowed to mate naturally with drones from the hives we had set up and with drones from hives owned by local beekeepers. After mating, samples of worker larvae were taken from the 41 queens that mated successfully and genotyped at 11 DNA microsatellite loci. Paternity analyses were then carried out to determine mating distances and isolation. An average of 10.2 fathers were detected among the 16 worker progeny. After correction for non-detection and non-sampling errors, the mean effective mating frequency of the test queens was estimated to be 17.2, which is a normal figure for honey bees. Ninety percent of the matings occurred within a distance of 7.5 km, and fifty percent within 2.5 km. The maximal mating distance recorded was 15 km. Queens and drones did occasionally mate across the borders between the two valleys, showing that the dividing mountain ridge Losehill does not provide complete isolation. Nevertheless, in the most isolated part of Edale sixty percent of all matings were to drones from Edale hives. The large majority of observed mating distances fell within the range of Hope Valley, making this site a suitable location for the long term conservation of a breeding population of black bees. © Springer 2005.",Article,Scopus

Despite their intractability they often exhibit clear temporal and spatial patterning. We demonstrate how a spatially explicit individual-based model of scramble competition with local dispersal can be approximated by a stochastic coupled map lattice. The approximation disentangles the deterministic and stochastic element of local interaction and dispersal. We are thus able to understand the individual-based model through a simplified set of equations. In particular, we demonstrate that demographic noise leads to increased stability in the dynamics of locally dispersing single-species populations. The coupled map lattice approximation has general application to a range of spatially explicit individual-based models. It provides a new alternative to current approximation techniques, such as the method of moments and reaction-diffusion approximation, that captures both stochastic effects and large-scale patterning arising in individual-based models. © 2004 Society for Mathematical Biology.

We show that nectar foraging rate (mass gathered per unit time) is positively correlated with worker size, in accordance with previous studies. It has been suggested that the greater foraging rate of large bees is due to their higher thermoregulatory capacity in cool conditions, but our data suggest that this is not so. Workers differing in size were not differentially affected by the weather. Regardless of size, naïve bees were poor foragers, often using more resources than they gathered. Foraging rate was not maximised until at least 30 trips had been made from the nest. Foraging rates were positively correlated with humidity, perhaps because nectar secretion rates were higher or evaporation of nectar lower at high humidity. Temperature, wind speed and cloud cover did not significantly influence foraging rate, within the summertime range that occurred during the study. Weather greatly influenced whether bees collected pollen or nectar. Pollen was preferably collected when it was warm, windy, and particularly when humidity was low; and preferably during the middle of the day. We suggest that bees collect pollen in dry conditions, and avoid collecting pollen when there is dew or rain-water droplets on the vegetation, which would make grooming pollen into the corbiculae difficult. Availability of sufficient dry days for pollen collection may be an important factor determining the success of bumblebee colonies. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",Article,Scopus

Knowledge of their ecology is vital for the design of effective management and conservation strategies but key aspects remain poorly understood. Here we employed microsatellite markers to estimate and compare foraging range and nest density among four UK species: Bombus terrestris, Bombus pascuorum, Bombus lapidarius, and Bombus pratorum. Workers were sampled along a 1.5-km linear transect across arable farmland. Eight or nine polymorphic microsatellite markers were then used to identify putative sisters. In accordance with previous studies, minimum estimated maximum foraging range was greatest for B. terrestris (758 m) and least for B. pascuorum (449 m). The estimate for B. lapidanus was similar to B. pascuorum (450 m), while that of B. pratorum was intermediate (674 m). Since the area of forage available to bees increases as the square of foraging range, these differences correspond to a threefold variation in the area used by bumblebee nests of different species. Possible explanations for these differences are discussed. Estimates for nest density at the times of sampling were 29, 68, 117, and 26/km2 for B. terrestris, B. pascuorum, B. lapidarius and B. pratorum, respectively.

Ex Tan.) and 'Afourer' mandarin [C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck x C. reticulata Blanco] is increasing in California as consumers' interest in seedless, easy peeling, and good tasting mandarins increases. The fruit would produce seeds if cross-pollination with compatible pollen source occurred. It is almost impossible to prevent cross-pollination between compatible mandarin cultivars by honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) within the multi-faceted agricultural environment in California. To produce seedless mandarin, growers either plant a single cultivar in a large solid block or try to use pollen-sterile navel oranges (C. sinensis) or satsuma mandarins (C. unshiu Marco.) as buffers to prevent cross-pollination. The question of how many rows of buffer trees or spacing can effectively prevent cross-pollination by honeybees between compatible mandarins is unclear. We initiated a study using fluorescent-labeled AFLP markers to determine the pollen parentages of 'Nules' clementine seedlings and 'Afourer' mandarin seedlings from two orchards in California. The longest distance of pollen flow at an orchard near Madera was 521 m. The pollen of 'Minneola' tangelo (C. reticulata x C. paradisi Macf.) was able to disperse across a minimum of 92 rows of 'Lane Late' navel oranges plus two rows of 'Afourer' mandarins to pollinate 'Afourer' mandarins. We also found that all the seedlings of 'Nules' clementine mandarin at an orchard near Bakersfield had been pollinated by 'Afourer' mandarin pollen. The pollen of 'Afourer' mandarin was able to disperse up to distances between 837 and 960 m to pollinate 'Nules' clementine. The pollen dispersal distance found in this study was at least 16 times longer than previously reported in a citrus orchard.

It has long been known that foraging bumblebee workers vary greatly in size, within species, and within single nests. This phenomenon has not been adequately explained. Workers of their relatives within the Apidae exhibit much less size variation. 2. For the bumblebee Bombus terrestris size, as measured by thorax width, was found to correspond closely with tongue length, so that larger bees are equipped to feed from deeper flowers. 3. The mean size of worker bees attracted to flowers was found to differ between plant species, and larger bees with longer tongues tended to visit deeper flowers. 4. Finally, handling time depended on the match between corolla depth and tongue length: large bees were slower than small bees when handling shallow flowers, but quicker than small bees when handling deep flowers. 5.

In this study, I extracted this overstrike effect on the plant choices of pollinators by analyzing patterns of visitation sequences within a single round-trip between the hive and foraging patch (bout). First, I simulated the visitation sequences within single bouts with a model to show how factors, including the bees' plant-type preferences, the arrangement of plants and the effect of overstrike on short-term memory, affect visitation sequences. Here, bees are assumed to forage in a patch consisting of two plant types (H and L). The model predicts that only the effect of overstrike on short-term memory causes assorted visitation sequences according to plant type (within-bout flower constancy). That is, if the overstrike-effect on short-term memory is the primary determinant of plant choice, then bees will fly to a type-L plant after visiting a type-L plant even if they predominantly visit type-H plants and vice versa. Next, I investigated individual bumblebees' visitation sequences at a patch of artificial inflorescences with a set-up similar to that assumed in the model. Two types of inflorescences were arranged on a Cartesian grid. Assorted visitation sequences according to inflorescence type were observed, depending on the distances among inflorescences. This result supports the hypotheses that bees fly to the same plant type as that last visited because short-term memory is displaced (overstruck) with information about the most recently visited plant type. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",Article,Scopus

At each choice point, they recognize a few cues in the range of positions where the cues occurred during the learning process. There is no need to postulate that they re-assemble the surrounding panorama in memory; only that they retain memories of the coincidences of cues in the expected retinotopic directions. The cues could be stimuli that excite groups of peripheral visual neurons. All the experimentally known cues are described, including modulation of the receptors, the locations of areas of black or colour, the nearness, size, averaged edge orientation, and radial and tangential edges. Cues of each type are separately summed within large fields, the size of which varies with the cue. Local orientation cues from edges at right angles cancel each other within each field, which also suggests that the discrimination of shape and texture is limited. Resolution depends on lateral interactions and the number of ommatidia required for each cue. To identify a new place, a few sparse cues, together with their directions, are learned in orientation flights. When the bee returns, the cues in the panorama are progressively matched as they coincide with the cues in memory. The limited number of cues, though economical for memory, may restrict the foraging behaviour and lead to flower constancy. This kind of a visual system is a candidate model for other animals or machines with economical processing systems. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",Review,Scopus

This is also an issue of increasing importance in forest systems as there has been a dramatic expansion of tree plantations, which have now reached 180 million ha globally. This has recently occurred in Australia with eucalypts. To help assess the risk of genetic pollution, we assess the pattern of realised pollen dispersal from exotic Eucalyptus nitens plantations into native E. ovata forest in Tasmania. We assessed the frequency of F1 hybrids in open-pollinated seed collected from native E. ovata trees located at varying distance from three exotic E. nitens plantations in Tasmania. Over 119,000 seedlings were screened for morphological markers diagnostic of each species and the F1 hybrid. F1 hybridisation averaged 7.2% within 100 m of the exotic E. nitens, with one native tree reaching 56%, but diminished to 0.7% by 200-300 m and continued at this low level to the limits of the sampling at 1.6 km. The decay in the percentage of interspecific F1 hybridisation with distance followed a power function with a negative exponent (%F1 = 91.435distance-0.789; R 2=0.84). Eucalyptus nitens is exclusively pollinated by small insects (smaller than honeybees), which the study shows can disperse pollen over 1.6 km.

We also review data on distribution, phenology and tongue length of these species. Overall, Fabaceae appear to be the major pollen source for most bumblebee species. In particular, long-tongued, late emerging species such as Bombus ruderatus, Bombus humilis and Bombus subterraneus specialize heavily in gathering pollen from Fabaceae, and this group of bumblebee species have all declined. Some of them are also at the edge of their geographic range in the UK, which may have rendered them more sensitive to environmental change. The decline of many bumblebee species is probably attributable largely to the loss of unimproved flower-rich grasslands, a habitat rich in Fabaceae. The bumblebee species that remain abundant are mostly short-tongued species that emerge early in the season and have less specialized diets; these species are very common in suburban gardens where they are able to exploit the broad range of floral resources. A third group of bumblebees are strongly associated with Ericaceae in moorland and heathland habitats, and have probably always had restricted distributions. A small number of species are not so easily categorised. Bombus soroeensis and B. ruderarius are not dietary specialists, nor are they close to the limit of their geographic range, but nevertheless they have declined.

The western honeybee, Apis mellifera, has been introduced to many parts of the world and is sometimes purported to be detrimental to native bees because it reduces their food base. It is seldom viewed in this light in Europe; however, when beekeepers maintain very high bee densities, the species could also be displacing insects in its native European range by reducing the resource base. 2. In England, populations of bumblebees (Bombus Latr. Hym.) have been decreasing both in terms of diversity and abundance, mainly because of a loss of habitat resulting from agricultural intensification. The impact of competition from other flower feeders is largely unknown. 3. Nineteen dry lowland heaths in southern England were sampled once for honeybees and bumblebees. Honeybee abundance varied from 4 to 81 bees per 100 m2 (mean = 30.89, median = 23), whereas bumblebees varied from 2 to 17 individuals per 100 m2 (mean = 8.26, median = 7), belonging to between one and five species. There was a negative association between honeybee and bumblebee abundance but there was no apparent relationship between honeybee abundance and bumblebee diversity. 4. The Bray-Curtis coefficient was used to compare the similarity in honeybee and bumblebee floral host breadth at these 19 sites. The coefficient was negatively associated with honeybee abundance: thus where honeybees were most abundant, bumblebees were fewer and/or foraged on different flower species. 5. Foraging host breadth was also examined at four heathlands over a field season (April to September). No association between honeybee abundance and foraging host breadth was found for short-tongued bees, although there was some evidence for a change in floral host breadth for long-tongued bees. 6. It is concluded that the impact of honeybees on bumblebees is complex. Although competition between the two species cannot be ruled out, it is perhaps equally likely that bumblebees decline in response to other factors, and that honeybees move independently of this decline.",Article,Scopus

The ability to discriminate among scents may depend on both scent intensity and the ratios of the concentrations of the volatile compounds of a complex mixture rather than on the presence of a few compounds. We used four scent-emitting cultivars of snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) to test this hypothesis by examining the ability of honeybees to differentiate among their scents. Each cultivar produced three monoterpenes (myrcene, E-β-ocimene, and linalool) and five phenylpropanoids (methylbenzoate, acetophenone, dimethoxytoluene, cis-methylcinnamate, and trans-methylcinnamate). Cultivars were reliably classified by their scents in a canonical discriminant analysis. Honeybees were unable to discriminate among the scents of flowers of the same cultivar in our assay. The ability of honeybees to discriminate among the scents of different cultivars was a function of the intensity of the floral scent. Discrimination was also correlated to the distance among the scents described by the discriminant analysis; the cultivars that had the greatest differences observed in the discriminant analysis were the easiest to discriminate. Our results show that honeybees are capable of using all of the floral volatiles to discriminate subtle differences in scent. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",Article,Scopus

This study examines the long-term effectiveness of four different management strategies to enhance and restore bumblebee foraging habitat on arable field margins in two regions with markedly contrasting landscape structure, farming systems and amount of semi-natural habitat. Bumblebees were monitored on 120 field margins in July and August, together with estimates of flower abundance and the vegetation composition. There were no differences in the abundance and diversity of the bumblebee assemblage between the two regions (East Anglia and the West Midlands), despite a greater abundance of flowers and flowering species on the lighter soils of the West Midlands. Very few bumblebees were recorded on intensively managed cereal field margins due to the lack of dicot species. Conservation headlands supported a significantly greater number of flowering dicots, but the majority of these were annuals which did not provide good forage for bumblebees. From an agronomic and ecological perspective, the removal of field margins from the cropping system was the best strategy for providing foraging habitat for bumblebees. Non-crop habitat resulting from natural regeneration provided good foraging habitat for bumblebee species, but most of the key forage species were pernicious weeds of agriculture (Cirsium spp.). Sowing non-crop field margins with wildlife seed mixtures had the potential for providing the best foraging habitat for bumblebees, so long as preferred forage species were introduced (e.g. Trifolium pratense). Further research is required to refine and target this management prescription for bumblebee conservation in the wider countryside. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

Expressions like “dance language” or “bee language” are associated with the name of the Austrian scientist Karl von Frisch (1886-1982), who observed that the body movements of foraging honeybees on their return to the nest from a valuable food source correlate with both its direction and its distance (von Frisch, 1965). Ever since this pioneering discovery, people have been fascinated by this concept of a “symbolic language” in which an abstract code (the waggle dance) is used to transmit information about remote objects (the food source). However, intensive investigations over the past decades, and steadily improving observation and recording methods, have revealed that the honeybees’ communication is of an intriguing complexity which we are only beginning to understand in depth. The dance movements with their intrinsic complexity are but one chapter of the whole story of communication processes that coordinate several hundreds or thousands of individuals belonging to a single bee colony. © 2006 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Book Chapter,Scopus

Newly emerged worker bees were identified with coloured paint or numbered plastic tags on their thorax, and were co-fostered in common colonies of European, Africanized or unrelated bee origin to infer if the variation found was due to genetic or environmental effects. Both European and Africanized bees varied significantly in their length of life, within a range of 19.9 to 25.9 days, but there was no clear and consistent difference for this trait between the two types of bees. Hive and colony environment influenced the length of life of both bee types. Bees lived longer in colonies with Africanized environment. These results suggest that genetic effects influence the length of life of workers bees to a lesser degree than do environmental effects. The age at which bees began foraging affected both the length of life and the foraging life of the experimental workers. Bees that started to forage late in life lived longer than those that started early. Additionally, bees that initiated foraging activities at a younger age had a longer foraging life. The strongest correlation was between length of life and foraging life (ρ = 0.66), indicating that bees that lived longer also had a longer foraging life.

We used a comparative approach to test whether rarity is associated with reproductive biology in two closely-related species pairs. This system has been recently altered by changes in fire regimes and the introduction of European honeybees. More than 35% of flowers matured fruits in the common species after natural-pollination compared to <20% of flowers in the rare species. All species were obligate outcrossers in each of the study populations, but only the two rare species were pollen-limited, having significantly lower fruit-set on open-pollinated flowers than those cross-pollinated by hand (mean ± SE; 0.18 ± 0.02 vs. 0.42 ± 0.05; p < 0.001). Native bees (Leioproctus species) and introduced honeybees (Apis mellifera) visited all species. The native bees visited fewer flowers within a plant and moved greater distances between plants while foraging than honeybees, so the native bees are expected to be more effective in promoting outcrossing. While honeybees were the most frequent visitors to flowers of all species, native bees made more visits to common than rare species (0.65 ± 0.20 vs. 0.20 ± 0.09). Our results suggest that the poorer reproductive success in rare Persoonia species is associated with lower pollinator effectiveness, which is exacerbated by frequent fires and introduced honeybees.

In this study, I use surveys of floral visitor communities across the geographic range of Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana (hereafter C. x. xantiana) (Onagraceae) to examine the structure of visitor communities, the specificity of the pollination system, and the role of variation in the abiotic vs. biotic environment in contributing to spatial variation in pollinator abundance and community composition. Although the assemblage of bee visitors to C. x. xantiana is very diverse (49 species), few were regular visitors and likely to act as pollinators. Seventy-four percent of visitor species accounted for only 11% of total visitor abundance and 69% were collected in three or fewer plant populations (of ten). Of the few reliable visitors, Clarkia pollen specialist bees were the most frequent visitors, carried more Clarkia pollen compared to generalist foragers, and were less likely to harbor foreign pollen. Overall, the core group of pollinators was obscured by high numbers of incidental visitors that are unlikely to contribute to pollination. In a geographic context, the composition of specialist pollinator assemblages varied considerably along the abiotic gradient spanning the subspecies' range. However, the overall abundance of specialist pollinators in plant populations was not influenced by the broad-scale abiotic gradient but strongly affected by local plant community associations. C. x. xantiana populations sympatric with pollinator-sharing congeners were visited twice as often by specialists compared to populations occurring alone. These positive indirect interactions among plant species may promote population persistence and species coexistence by enhancing individual reproductive success. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",Article,Scopus

A key assumption is that corridors facilitate exchange rates of organisms between otherwise isolated patches. If the organisms are pollinators, corridors may be important for maintaining genetically viable populations of the plants that they pollinate. We tested the hypothesis that corridors increase the movement of insect pollinators into patches of habitat and thereby increase pollen transfer for two species of plants, one pollinated by butterflies (Lantana camara) and the other by bees and wasps (Rudbeckia hirta). We worked in an experimental landscape consisting of 40 ≥1-ha patches of early-successional habitat in a matrix of forest. Within each of eight experimental units, two patches were connected by a corridor (150 X 25 m), and three were not. Patch shape varied to control for the area added by the presence of a corridor. Differences in patch shape also allowed us to test alternative hypotheses of how corridors might function. The Traditional Corridor Hypothesis posits that corridors increase immigration and emigration by functioning as movement conduits between patches. The Drift Fence Hypothesis posits that corridors function by ""capturing"" organisms dispersing through the matrix, redirecting them into associated habitat patches. Using fluorescent powder to track pollen, we found that pollen transfer by butterflies between patches connected by a corridor was significantly higher than between unconnected patches (all values mean ± 1 SE: 59% ± 9.2% vs. 25% ± 5.2% of flowers receiving pollen). Likewise, pollen transfer by bees and wasps was significantly higher between connected patches than between unconnected patches (30% ± 4.2% vs. 14.5% ± 2.2%). These results support the Traditional Corridor Hypothesis. There was little support, however, for the Drift Fence Hypothesis. To generalize our results to a larger scale, we measured the probability of pollen transfer by butterflies as a function of distance along a 2000 X 75 m corridor. Pollen transfer probability exponentially declined with respect to distance and successfully predicted pollen transfer probability on the scale of our previous experiment. These results suggest that corridors facilitate pollen transfer in fragmented landscapes. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus

Such multiple paternity within fruits can have important consequences for both parental and offspring fitness, but little is known about the frequency of multiple paternity or the mechanisms causing it. In this study we quantify the extent of multiple paternity in replicate experimental arrays of Mimulus ringens (square-stem monkeyflower) and use observations of pollinator behavior to infer mechanisms generating multiply sired fruits. In each array, floral displays were trimmed to two, four, eight, or 16 flowers per plant to span the range of display sizes observed in nature. In our sample of 204 fruits, more than 95% had two or more outcross pollen donors. The number of sires per fruit averaged 4.63 ± 0.10 (mean ± 1 SE), including selfs, and did not vary significantly with floral display treatment. Patterns of bumble bee foraging, combined with limited pollen carryover, suggest that observed levels of multiple paternity cannot be fully explained by single probes that deposited mixed pollen loads. Multiple probes to flowers, each delivering pollen from 1-3 different sires, are more likely to have caused the observed patterns. These sequential visits may reduce the potential for pollen competition and female choice based on pollen tube growth rate.",Article,Scopus

Metabolic rates of individuals are measured in a running tube respirometer while they are unladen and laden at 25°C. Workers voluntarily collect a load of 6 μL of a 30% sucrose solution (mass = 6.8 mg), which results in an internal load of about 50% of the ant mass and is close to a full load for ants within this size range. The gross cost of unladen running is 264 J kg-1 m-1, while that of laden running is 225 J kg -1 m-1. The mass used to calculate the cost of laden running includes body mass of ant and load carried. Load carriage cost in C. rufipes foragers is calculated to be about 60% as much as body carriage per unit mass.

Strategies for their conservation require knowledge of their foraging range and nesting density, both of which are poorly understood. Previous studies have mainly focussed on the cosmopolitan bumblebee species Bombus terrestris, and implicitly assume this to be representative of other species. Here we use a landscape-scale microsatellite study to estimate the foraging range and nesting density of two ecologically dissimilar species, B. terrestris and B. pascuorum. Workers were sampled along a 10 km linear transect and 8-9 polymorphic microsatellite markers used to identify putative sisters. We provide the first published estimates of the number of colonies using a circle of radius 50 m in an agricultural landscape: 20.4 for B. terrestris and 54.7 for B. pascuorum. Estimates of nest density differed significantly between the two species: 13 km-2 for B. terrestris and 193 km-2 for B. pascuorum. Foraging ranges also differed substantially, with B. pascuorum foraging over distances less than 312 m and B. terrestris less than 625 m. Clearly bumblebee species differ greatly in fundamental aspects of their ecology. This has significant implications for the development of conservation strategies for rare bumblebees and isolated plant populations, for the management of bumblebees as pollinators, and for predicting patterns of gene flow from genetically modified plants.",Article,Scopus

Because the breeding system influences both demographic (reproductive success) and genetic (inbreeding depression, evolutionary potential) parameters that are crucial for population maintenance, the reproductive ecology of E. alpinum was investigated. Specifically, the aims of the study were (1) to determine the factors (resources and/or pollen) limiting plant fitness; and (2) to assess the potential for gene flow within a plant, within a patch of plants, and across a whole valley where the species is abundant. • Methods: Field experiments were performed at two sites in the Fournel valley, France, over three consecutive years. Studies included a phenological survey, observations of pollinators (visitation rates and flight distances), dispersal of a fluorescent powder used as a pollen analogue, the use of seed traps, determination of the pollen/ ovule ratio, and an experiment to test whether seed production is limited by pollen and/or by resources. • Key results: E. alpinum is pollinated by generalist pollinators, visitation rates are very high and seed set is resource- rather than pollen-limited. The short flights of honeybees indicate a high potential for geitonogamy, and low pollen and seed dispersals suggest strong genetic structure over short distances. These results are interpreted in the light of previous molecular markers studies, which, in contrast, showed complete outcrossing and high genetic homogeneity. • Conclusions. The study highlights the usefulness of adopting several complementary approaches to understanding the dynamic processes at work in natural populations, and the conservation implications for E. alpinum are emphasized. Although the studied populations do not seem threatened in the near future, long-term monitoring appears necessary to assess the impact of habitat fragmentation. Moreover, this study provides useful baseline data for future investigations in smaller and more isolated populations. © 2004 Annals of Botany Company.",Article,Scopus

The species was pollinated by the giant honeybee (Apis dorsata) in a year of intensive community-level mass-flowering or general flowering (1996), but by several species of moths in a year of less-intensive general flowering (1998). We carried out paternity analysis based on six DNA microsatellite markers on a total of 277 mature trees forming four spatially distinct subpopulations in a 70 ha area, and 147 and 188 2-year-old seedlings originating from seeds produced in 1996 and 1998 (cohorts 96 and 98, respectively). Outcrossing rates (0.93 and 0.96 for cohorts 96 and 98, respectively) did not differ between years. Mean dispersal distances (222 and 192 m) were not significantly different between the 2 years but marginally more biased to long distance in 1996. The mean relatedness among cross-pollinated seedlings sharing the same mothers in cohort 96 was lower than that in cohort 98. This can be attributed to the two facts that the proportion of inter-subpopulations pollen flow among cross-pollination events was marginally higher in cohort 96 (44%) than in cohort 98 (33%), and that mature trees within the same subpopulations are genetically more related to each other than those between different subpopulations.

One gap in knowledge concerns the pattern and extent of pollinator movement among these sexually deceptive flowers and how this translates to pollen and gene flow. Our aim was to use mark and recapture techniques to investigate the behavior and movement of male Colletes cunicularius, an important bee pollinator of Ophrys. Our study site was located in northern Switzerland where a large population of the bees was nesting. Within two plots, (10x40 m), we marked bees with different colors and numbered tags. Seventeen percent of the 577 marked bees were recaptured over a period of 1 to a maximum of 11 days. However, the number of recaptures dropped dramatically after 3-5 days, suggesting an average lifetime of less than 10 days. Mark-recapture distances varied from 0 to 50 m, with a mean of 5 m. Our findings show that individual male bees patrol a specific and restricted region of the nesting area in search of mates. This mark-recapture study provides the first clues about the potential movement of pollen within populations of Ophrys orchids. We predict that orchid-pollen movements mediated by bees will be similar to the mark-recapture distances in this study.

Overall, flower choice patterns varied among bees, ranging from random selection to complete constancy. When flowers contained greater reward volumes and were spaced farther apart, bees showed less flower constancy and more moves to closely neighbouring flowers. Changes in reward concentration had no effect on flower constancy; however, more dilute rewards produced shorter flight times between flowers. In addition, there was a strong positive relationship between degree of flower constancy and net rate of energy gain when flowers were spaced farther apart, indicating that constant bees were more economic foragers than inconstant bees. Together, these results support the view that the flower constancy of pollinators reflects an economic foraging decision.",Article,Scopus

These studies suggest that the bee's ""odometer"" is driven by the optic flow (image motion) that is experienced during flight. One might therefore expect that, when bees fly to a food source through a varying outdoor landscape, their waggle dances would depend upon the nature of the terrain experienced en route. We trained honeybees to visit feeders positioned along two routes, each 580 m long. One route was exclusively over land. The other was initially over land, then over water and, finally, again over land. Flight over water resulted in a significantly flatter slope of the waggle-duration versus distance regression, compared to flight over land. The mean visual contrast of the scenes was significantly greater over land than over water. The results reveal that, in outdoor flight, the honeybee's odometer does not run at a constant rate; rather, the rate depends upon the properties of the terrain. The bee's perception of distance flown is therefore not absolute, but scene-dependent.

Tracking predatory insects presents a considerable challenge as they are often small, cryptic and highly mobile organisms. Using insect-borne pollen present either on the exoskeleton or within the gut, presents a useful technique by which the movements (spatial displacements) of insects can be determined, based on the distribution of flowering plants in the area, an appropriate pollen key or atlas, and an understanding of pollination ecology. Pollen has successfully been used to track the movement of bees and moths, but has rarely been used to track predatory insects. Since many predators are likely to encounter pollen as they forage on flowers, they are good candidates for this technique. In this review we examine two types of study that use pollen to track the movements of predatory insects: (a) those in which pollen from the surrounding landscape is used to assess habitat usage and short-term movement of generalist predators from a range of insect orders, and (b) those in which pollen from a known point-source is used to assess the movement and dispersal distance of the insects. We discuss the benefits and limitations of using pollen to determine the movement of predatory insects, and explain how the information derived can contribute to optimising the use of predatory insects within the agricultural landscape in integrated pest management programmes. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Among animals, stingless bees exhibit the unique behavior of depositing long substrate-borne odor trails that assist the orientation of flying nestmates to a specific three-dimensional food location. However, relatively little is known about the spatial structure of such odor trails, particularly vertical trails, and whether these trails are polarized to indicate the correct terminus. We show that a stingless bee, Trigona spinipes, can rapidly recruit nest-mates in large bursts to a food source at a specific distance, direction, and height. In conjunction with a major recruitment burst, foragers deposited odor marks that attracted nestmates for up to 20 min. Surprisingly, these odor marks formed a short odor trail instead of a complete odor trail extending from the feeder to the nest (the classic description of a meliponine odor trail). The length of the odor trails varied between different feeder locations with different colonies, from a minimum of 3 m to a maximum of 29 m. The odor marks formed a polarized trail that newcomers followed to the end with the most concentrated odor marks (the feeder), even when the entire odor trail was rotated 180° and clean test feeders were set out at locations that foragers had never previously fed at. Thus locale odor or the potential communication of food location inside the nest do not account for the ability of newcomers to find the correct terminus.

Flies maintain a straight course and monitor their motion through the environment by sensing the patterns of optic flow induced in the eyes. Bees negotiate narrow gaps by balancing the speeds of the images in their two eyes, and they control flight speed by holding constant the average image velocity as seen with their two eyes. Bees achieve a smooth landing on a horizontal surface by holding the image velocity of the surface constant during approach, thus ensuring that flight speed is automatically close to zero at touchdown. Foraging bees estimate the distance that they have traveled to reach a food source by integrating the optic flow experienced en route; this integration gives them a visually driven ""odometer.""

We show that foragers of the aggressive meliponine bee, Trigona spinipes, can detect and orient towards odour marks deposited by a competitor, Melipona rufiventris, and then rapidly take over the food source, driving away or killing their competitors. When searching for food sources at new locations that they are not already exploiting, T. spinipes foragers strongly prefer M. rufiventris odour marks to odour marks deposited by their own nest-mates, whereas they prefer nest-mate odour marks over M. rufiventris odour marks at a location already occupied by T. spinipes nest-mates.

In recent years the production of the Styrian oil pumpkin listed severe losses, one of the reasons is a decreased availability of pollinators. Since a great loss of bee colonies (decrease of about 200.000 beehives in the last ten years) and wild bees can be observed in Austria and worldwide, an adequate pollination cannot be guaranteed any longer. Strategies to find alternative pollinators and to ensure sufficient pollination are important. In this study we determined the pollination efficiency of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) compared to honeybees (Apis mellifera). Further we investigated the pollination behaviour (flower visit rate, visit frequency and forage distances) of bumblebees in the open field, to see if they can be used as an alternative, if honeybee colonies continue to decline, or honeybee pollination alone is not sufficient, for example at adverse weather. These studies of bumblebees in Cucurbita fields are the first ones in Austria, as up to now bumblebees were only used in glasshouses or orchards. Our studies showed that bumblebees can be used in the open field and can lead to a general improvement in pollination, as bumblebees visited four to five times more flowers in a minute and foraged at adverse weather, even during rain. But the use of commercial bumblebees in Styrian pumpkin fields, as already used in tomato or pepper greenhouses, can not be a solution for the pollination problems as at least four to five hives / hectare are needed. They can only be an alternative if the natural populations can be increased again, this means habitat and food resources must be conserved.",Article,Scopus

As previously shown M. seminigra is able to use visual flow to estimate flight distances. The present study investigated whether foraging bees encode the visually measured distance in their thorax vibrations. Bees were trained to collect food in flight tunnels lined with a black-and-white pattern on their side walls and floor, which substantially influenced the image motion they experienced. When the bees had collected inside the tunnels the temporal pattern of their vibrations differed significantly from the pattern after collecting in a natural environment. These changes, however, were not associated with the visual flow experienced inside the tunnel. Bees collecting in tunnels offering little visual flow (stripes parallel to flight direction) modified their vibrations similarly to bees collecting in tunnels with high image motion (cross stripes). A higher energy expenditure due to drastically reduced flight velocities inside the tunnel is suggested to be responsible for changes in the thorax vibrations. The bees' vibrations would thus reflect the overall energetic budget of a foraging trip. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",Article,Scopus

An increase of energy gains at the food source due to an increased sugar concentration was followed by an increase of both the pulse duration and the duty cycle and by a decrease of the pause duration between two subsequent pulses.

However, such foragers may also play a significant role in colony foraging, particularly in small colonies. Here we report that reactivated Scaptotrigona mexicana foragers can recruit with high precision to a specific food location. The recruitment precision of reactivated foragers was evaluated by placing control feeders to the left and the right of the training feeder (direction-precision tests) and between the nest and the training feeder and beyond it (distance-precision tests). Reactivated foragers arrived at the correct location with high precision: 98.44% arrived at the training feeder in the direction trials (five-feeder fan-shaped array, accuracy of at least ±6° of azimuth at 50 m from the nest), and 88.62% arrived at the training feeder in the distance trials (five-feeder linear array, accuracy of at least ±5 m or ±10% at 50 m from the nest).

Theory predicts that the susceptibility of patches of plants to gene flow mediated by incoming pollinators will depend on the length of pollinator residence (the number of flowers visited during a bout in a patch). We sought to determine whether pollinator residence is sufficiently sensitive to patch size and separation to influence levels of gene flow significantly. We studied oilseed rape Brassica napus as an exemplar of a conventional animal-pollinated plant and as a species where there is a risk of genetic escape from genetically modified (GM) varieties. 2. We determined pollinator residence in 36 patches created by mowing an agricultural field of flowering oilseed rape. Each square patch had an edge length of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 m. Patches were separated by either 9 m or 18 m from the border of a large unmown area of crop. We used the residence of bumblebees (Bombus spp.) to solve a model of bumblebee-mediated gene flow. 3. Bumblebee residence increased significantly with patch area, but did not depend on the separation distance of the patch from the large areas of crop. Even in the largest patches, bees visited only c. 60 of the c. 1 × 105 flowers before leaving. 4. If bumblebees were the sole pollinators, the model predicted that 4-8% of the seed produced by the smaller patches (c. 80-320 plants) had fathers outside the patch, whereas in the larger patches (720-8000 plants) the prediction was 2-4%. Nevertheless, larger patches should produce the greatest number of seeds with extrinsic paternity. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our observations demonstrate that susceptibility to pollinator-mediated gene flow is liable to decrease systematically as the size of plant patches increases. These findings can inform the management of genetic diversity in and among small or fragmented populations. If the patch size-gene flow relationship that we observed applies to larger scales, the model could estimate gene flow between GM crops and volunteer or feral populations in agricultural landscapes.",Article,Scopus

Most animals have to bridge some distances in space and time to provide all resources necessary for survival. Little is known about how the local and regional management of tropical agroforestry systems, differing in the availability of food resources and suitable nesting sites, determine foraging trip duration and density of bees and wasps (Hymenoptera Aculeata). 2. In this study, foraging trip duration and brood-cell density (in trap nests exposed for a 15-month period) were analysed for three species, which represent three guilds in 24 agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia): the pollinator Heriades sp. aff fulvescens (Apidae), the cacao caterpillar-hunting predator Rhynchium haemorrhoidale umeroatrum (Eumenidae) and the spider-hunting predator Auplopus levicarinatus (Pompilidae). The agroforestry systems were characterized by plant species richness, blossom cover of herbs, light intensity and distance from the nearest natural forest. 3. The correlation of foraging time to bee and wasp density showed the relative importance of food and nest-site availability for the pollinator and the spider-hunting predator, because both parameters are correlated with light intensity in the agroforestry systems. In contrast, foraging time and nest density of the eumenid predator were not correlated because of the distance between high quantities of food resources (in sites with dense cacao plants) and nesting sites (in adjacent natural forests). 4. The eumenid response to local and regional agroforestry management illustrates that species may survive only in landscapes that permit access to a multiple set of resources. Accordingly, habitat evaluations using only foraging time may lead to wrong conclusions, as key drivers of population dynamics may not be inside but outside the local systems, emphasizing the need for a landscape approach.",Article,Scopus

Both feeders were the only food sources exploited by the colony during the assays since a flight chamber was used. After receiving nectar, hive bees performed processing cycles that involved several behaviors and concluded when they returned to the delivery area to receive a new food sample. During these cycles, receivers mainly performed oral contacts offering food, or inspected cells, and often both. In the latter case, both behaviors occurred simultaneously and at the same distance from the hive entrance. When they performed a single task, either the occurrence of cell inspections increased or contact offerings decreased for the highest reward rate offered to the donor-forager. Receivers also begged for food more often after interacting with low-profit foragers. Thus, the profitability of the food source exploited by nectar-forager honeybees could affect receiver behaviors within the hives based on individual-to-individual interactions.",Article,Scopus

Furthermore, there is a strong tendency for colonies of this species to aggregate at perennially utilized nesting sites that may be shared by more than 150 colonies. These behavioral features suggest that colonies within aggregations should be more related than random colonies, but that the long-distance migration could act to minimize genetic differentiation both between geographical areas and within aggregations. Our genetic study supports these conjectures arising from natural history. A. dorsata aggregations are comprised of colonies that share more alleles than expected by chance. Although queens heading neighboring colonies are not close relatives, fixation indices show significant genetic differentiation among aggregation sites. However, there appears to be sufficient gene flow among aggregations to prevent high degrees of relatedness developing between colonies within aggregations. The results also suggest that there is significant population structuring between geographical regions, although the level of structuring caused by aggregation exceeds the differentiation attributable to geographic region.",Article,Scopus

The trial consisted of two identical strips (9 m x 45 m) along the forest ground-level discrete vegetation having herbaceous diversity. The design was a 'V', truncated in such a way that the zone, without any vegetation, between the two strips varied from 4.5 to 18 m in width. A nest of M. panamica colony was placed at 12 m from the top of the 'V'. Three equal sectors (135 m2) were identified in each strip. The bees were marked with different colours according to each sector of one strip, named the donor strip. Almost all bees were marked until their number was nearly balanced between the three sectors. Then, marked and unmarked bees were counted on the donor and recipient strips. Results showed that the foraging area in a given strip is about 405 m2 and that a mean proportion of 3.45% of marked bees/total number of bees in colony was recovered in the recipient strip. It was found that a barren zone from 4.5 to 18 m in width was not sufficient to completely discourage bees from crossing between two identical resources, but that it significantly reduced cross-pollination. The bees dispersed pollens by bee-bee interactions within the nest, showing high diversity of pollens from outgoing bees, rather than incoming ones.

Bees learnt to discriminate similar colours, but with smaller colour distances the frequency of errors increased. This indicates that pollen transfer might occur between flowers with similar colours, even if these colours are distinguishable. The effect of similar colours on reducing foraging accuracy of bees is evident for colour distances high above discrimination threshold, which explains previous field observations showing that bees do not exhibit complete flower constancy unless flower colour between species is distinct. Bees tested in spectrally different illumination conditions experienced a significant decrease in their ability to discriminate between similar colours. The extent to which this happens differs in different areas of colour space, which is consistent with a von Kries-type model of colour constancy. We find that it would be beneficial for plant species to have highly distinctive colour signals to overcome limitations on the bees performance in reliably judging differences between similar colours.

Pollinators visiting large floral displays may probe several flowers in sequence, leading to geitonogamous (among-flower) self-pollination. To investigate the relationship between floral display size and patterns of pollinator movement, we studied foraging by several pollinator species in four replicate arrays of Mimulus ringens (Scrophulariaceae). In each array displays were trimmed to two, four, eight and 16 flowers per plant. 2. Bees preferred large displays, and probed more flowers in sequence on large than on small displays. However, the proportion of available flowers probed decreased with display, resulting in nearly equal floral visitation rates across treatments. 3. Because pollinators probed more flowers in sequence on large displays, plants with numerous flowers should experience more geitonogamous self-pollination than plants with small displays. 4. In all four treatments, pollinators frequently visited only one flower before leaving the plant. As the first flower probed on a plant cannot receive geitonogamous pollen, this potentially reduces selfing rates for those flowers, compared to flowers probed late in a long visitation sequence on a plant. Such differences among flowers in pollination history should increase variation in geitonogamous self-pollination among fruits within plants. 5. The three most abundant pollinator species differed significantly in behaviours that could influence plant mating patterns, including number of flowers probed per plant; interplant movement distances; and grooming. Variation in foraging patterns was also evident among individuals within species. These subtle differences in response should affect the pollination services provided to plants.",Article,Scopus

Insects such as bees and ants have evolved an accurate path integration system, assessing and coding rotations with the help of a general directional reference, the sun azimuth. In mammals, by contrast, this process can take place through purely idiothetic (mainly proprioceptive and vestibular) signals. However, without any stable external reference for measuring direction, path integration is highly affected by cumulative errors and thus has been considered so far as valid only for short-distance navigation. Here we show through two path integration experiments (homing and shortcut finding) that the blind mole rat assesses direction both through internal signals and by estimating its heading in relation to the earth's magnetic field. Further, it is shown that the greater the circumvolution and length of the traveled path, the more the animal relies on the geomagnetic field.

We evaluated their nest-searching behaviour in different test situations to elucidate the nature of the visual marks they used in this task. When we modified or removed geometrical figures surrounding the nest, the bees searched for longer, showing that they noticed the introduced changes. However, these manipulations never prevented bees from finding their nest, suggesting that other visual cues were crucial in the task. Manipulations of the edges provided by the boundaries of the device (nest block, metal sheet on which the block was mounted) strongly impaired the homing performance. The further away the edges that were left intact, the stronger was the impairment of the homing behaviour. These results suggest that bees learn the distances of the various edges from the goal and that edges have a hierarchical significance according to their distance from the nest. The most distant edges provide vague information, which suffices to guide the insect towards the next edge in the sequence, until it recognizes the final, precise location of the nest. The results support the conclusion that information on distances is acquired using cues derived from motion parallax generated by the insect's self-motion. Recognition of edge parameters such as position and orientation might be achieved by an image-matching mechanism based on dynamic processes.

A striking example of this plasticity is seen in social insects, such as ants and bees, where different castes can have very different life spans. In particular, the honeybee worker offers an intriguing example of environmental control on aging rate, because workers are conditionally sterile and display very different aging patterns depending on which temporal caste they belong to (hive bee, forager, or a long-lived caste capable of surviving for several months on honey alone). The ubiquitous yolk protein vitellogenin appears to play a key role in the regulatory circuitry that controls this variation. Here we outline the current understanding of the relation between vitellogenin and somatic maintenance in honeybee workers, and how this relation can be understood in a life history context.",Review,Scopus

These insects remember no more than what is needed to sustain the separate and parallel strategies that they employ when travelling between their nest and foraging sites. One major strategy is path integration. The insect keeps a running tally of its distance and direction from the nest and so can always return home. This global path integration is enhanced by long-term memories of significant sites that insects store in terms of the coordinates (direction and distance) of these sites relative to the nest. With these memories insects can plan routes that are steered by path integration to such sites. Quite distinct from global path integration are memories associated with familiar routes. Route memories include stored views of landmarks along the route with, in some cases, local vectors linked to them. Local vectors by encoding the direction and/or distance from one landmark to the next, or from one landmark to a goal, help an insect keep to a defined route. We review experiments showing that although local vectors can be recalled by recognising landmarks, the global path integration system is independent of landmark information and that landmarks do not have positional coordinates associated with them. The major function of route landmarks is thus procedural, telling an insect what action to perform next, rather than its location relative to the nest. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Simonson and S.W. Hassler, document a range of tsunami deposits associated with impact fallout units whose impact connection is identified by associated microtektites and microkrystites (condensation spherules). The impact connection of these particles is demonstrated by iridium anomalies, unique platinum group elements patterns, and Ni-rich mineral phases. Densely packed tsunami-transported fragments and boulders overlie microkrystite units of the >2,629 ± 5 Ma top Jeerinah Impact Layer (JIL). Tsunami events closely follow spherule settling associated with the 2,561 ± 8 Ma Spherule Marker Bed SMB-1 and SMB-2 impact events, Bee Gorge Member, Wittenoom Formation. The two impact cycles are separated by a stratigraphically consistent silicified black siltstone, representing a ""Quiet Interval."" The SMB turbidites display turbulence eddies, climbing ripples, conglomerate pockets, slumps, and waterlogged sediment deformation features. Consequences of tsunami in the probably contemporaneous Carawine Dolomite (Pb-Pb carbonate ages of ∼2.56-2.54 Ga), eastern Hamersley Basin, include sub-autochthonous below-wave base excavation and megabrecciation of sea floor substrata, resulting in a unique 10-30-m-thick spherule-bearing megabreccia marker mapped over a nearly 100-km north-south strike distance in the east Hamersley Basin. The field relations suggest a pre-tsunami settling of the bulk of the spherules. Tsunami wave effects include: (1) dispersal of the spherule-rich soft upper sea floor sediments as a subaqueous mud cloud and (2) excavation of consolidated substrata below the soft sediment zone. Excavation and megabrecciation included injection of liquefied spherule-bearing microbreccia into dilated fractures in the disrupted underlying carbonates. Near-perfect preservation of the spherules within the basal microbreccia veins suggests tsunami-induced hydraulic pressures locally exceeded lithostatic pressure. Late-stage settling of spherule-bearing mud clouds in the wake of the tsunami is represented by an abundance of spherules in the uppermost microbreccia zones of the megabreccia pile. From the deep below-wave base facies of the Carawine Dolomite, tsunami wave amplitudes may have exceeded 200 m depth. The ∼2.47-2.50 Ga DGS4 (S4 Macroband, Dales Gorge Member, Brockman Iron Formation) fallout units include exotic chert and carbonate boulders transported by tsunami following settling of a 10-20-cm-thick microkrystite and microtektite-rich unit. Seismic perturbations preceding deposition of the JIL and SMB fallout units are marked by rip-up clasts. The geochemistry of microkrystites and microtektites suggests impact fallout originated from impacts in simatic/ oceanic crustal regions, although tsunami waves may have originated from seismically reactivated faults and plate margins located at distance from the impact craters. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Article,Scopus

This woodpecker is thought to breed in pairs, although only three active nests have been superficially described. I present observations of group and breeding behavior of the Great Slaty Woodpecker from five regions in western Indonesia. Thirty-six independent units of Great Slaty Woodpeckers involved predominantly groups (81%), followed by pairs (17%), and one single bird. Mean size of groups larger than 2 was 4.2 ± 1.2 (range 3-6) individuals. Group size did not vary as a function of time of year, logging disturbance, or the number of sympatric woodpecker species. Individuals attended the same groups on consecutive days. Groups comprised several males and females. Roost holes, spaced >200 m apart, were occupied by single birds. In 65% of foraging groups, two to five members simultaneously exploited a single food source such as a stingless bee, termite, or ant nest; frequency of food-source sharing peaked at groups of four individuals. Within foraging groups, females spent more time climbing and searching; males did more hammering, pecking, and flaking. Grouping in this species is perhaps induced by cooperatively searching for and exploiting infrequent but highly profitable food sources. Two nests of Great Slaty Woodpeckers were found, one of which was attended by two males and one female. In 18% of occasions, Great Slaty Woodpecker groups associated temporarily with White-bellied Woodpeckers (Dryocopus javensis).

The method involves Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection of hypocotyl explants, followed by the production of antibiotic- or herbicide-resistant embryogenic callus and the subsequent induction of somatic embryos and plants. Key elements of the improvement are the use of buffering agents to stabilise medium pH and bottom-cooling of the cultures. Transformation was verified by PCR and Southern blot hybridisation. Transcription of transgenes was confirmed by RT-PCR and product sequencing. Expression of transgenes was detected by histochemical GUS staining, phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT) enzyme assays for bar and pat genes, and western analysis of transgenic sunflower seed albumin protein. Expression of various transgenes was detected in stem, leaf, seed, capsule and latex. The pat gene was demonstrated to be stably inherited to the T 2 generation and to confer phosphinothricin (PPT) herbicide resistance. Most T0 plants showed normal morphology, were self-fertile and the transgenes displayed the expected Mendelian segregation. The percentage of explants producing somatic embryos that developed into plantlets able to be transplanted to soil, ranged from 6-11% in two Tasmanian cultivars. A field trial using pat transgenic plants was designed to estimate the frequency of hybridisation at various distances into buffer rows of non-transgenic poppies and to related weed species, P. somniferum spp. setigerum and P. dubium. The frequency of hybridisation to completely compatible poppy fell sharply with distance, being 2.6% at 20 cm, 2.13% at 0.5 m and falling to 0% at 2.5 and 5 m. No hybridisation could be detected to two weed species under open pollination conditions, including the compatible P. somniferum spp. setigerum, when grown as close as 20 cm, despite flowering at the same time as the transgenic plants in the presence of foraging bees.",Article,Scopus

For calculations of the daily population size, the Jolly-Seber model for open populations with time-dependent survival and capture rates was used. The mean daily population size corresponded well to the number of nests marked in the aggregation of A. vaga. The method of mark-recapture achieved the most accurate data when the number of sampling periods and the capture probability was high. The results document a decrease in population size of the investigated A. vaga aggregation during 4 successive years. A population increase of its parasitoids B. major is considered to be one reason for the population decline of A. vaga in 1999. The sex ratio of A. vaga was biased toward females, contrary to the expected higher number of males. Results of the mark-recapture studies showed that up to 50% of females left the aggregation or died at the beginning of the season. The females probably colonized new aggregations at distances further than 200 m away from their birth aggregation, as no marked females were observed in the environs of the study area. This behavior is interpreted as a parasite avoidance strategy. The bee populations in the study area form a web of interconnected aggregations.

In this paper we investigate the effects of sub-lethal doses of imidacloprid on foraging activity and homing ability of honey bees. Honey bees from one hive were trained to forage on an artificial feeder filled with a 50% sucrose solution. The feeder was gradually moved up to a distance of 500 meters from the hive. Thirty bees, foraging on the sucrose solution, were captured, individually marked with coloured number tags and transferred into a flying cage, acting as control. The feeder was then replaced with a new one, filled with an imidacloprid supplemented sucrose solution. Again, thirty bees foraging on this feeder were captured, individually marked with different coloured number tags and transferred into an other flying cage. Three concentrations of imidacloprid were tested: 100 ppb, 500 ppb and 1000 ppb. The solutions at 500 ppb and 1000 ppb of imidacloprid had a repellent effect and the bees stopped visiting the feeder, hence only 10 and 20 honey bees, respectively, were captured for the two doses. Since the effects of imidacloprid start half an hour to one hour after ingestion, bees were released from the flying cage 1 hour after confinement. After the release, the behaviour of the bees was followed for 2 hours: two observers at the hive and one observer at the feeding site recorded the arrival and the departure of the marked bees. The presence of the bees at the hive and at the feeder was also recorded for one hour, 5 and 24 hours after the release. The results show that almost all the control honey bees returned to the hive, and started again visiting the feeder between 2 to 5 hours after the release. Honey bees fed with the concentration of 100 ppb also returned to the hive, but they returned to visit the feeder only 24 hours after the release. Honey bees fed with 500 ppb and 1000 ppb completely disappeared after the release, and they were not seen during the following 24 hours, neither at the hive nor at the feeding site.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Spinosad controls many caterpillar pests in vines, pome fruit and vegetables (including tomatoes and peppers), thrips in tomatoes, peppers and ornamental cultivation and dipterous leafminers in vegetables and ornamentals. The effects of spinosad to honeybees have been extensively researched. Testing has been performed under a variety of conditions in a range of countries globally. Studies to determine the acute toxicity of spinosad under laboratory conditions were conducted to generate LD50 or LC50 values for oral and contact routes of administration. These demonstrated that spinosad was highly toxic to worker honeybees under worst case laboratory conditions. Residue tests conducted under laboratory conditions using worker honeybees exposed to treated foliage, indicated that dry product residues were harmless. Therefore, the effects seen in laboratory acute toxicity tests did not translate to a more realistic exposure scenario. Semi-field cage studies demonstrated that spinosad was safe to bees when applied to flowering crops during periods of low bee activity. At high application rates evidence for repellence was seen and in one study some minor effects were noted on brood survival. In field studies dry residues of spinosad were safe to foraging worker honeybees, with no adverse effects seen on mortality, foraging behaviour, brood or queen. It can be concluded that spinosad, when used according to the approved product label recommendations, would be safe to foraging worker bees, queen and brood and may be safely used in flowering crops if applications are made during periods of low bee activity.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Shaking occurred most often after the first foraging successes of the day and frequently following the first foraging success after a spell of bad weather. These findings confirm several hypotheses that predict that individual foraging success underlies colony-level patterns in shaking activity. Some results do not fit the previously suggested messages of the shaking signal. Therefore, I propose that the shaking signal has the very broad message: 'reassess your current activity'. This message can explain the wide range of contexts that trigger shaking while it acknowledges that the meaning of the signal depends entirely on the context of the recipient.",Article,Scopus

We therefore trained marked foragers of two species, Melipona mandacaia and M. bicolor, to feeders at different distances and to different sucrose concentrations at the same distance. In both species, foragers successfully recruited to a rich 2.5-M food source and produced pulsed recruitment sounds in which pulse duration was significantly and positively correlated with distance to the rich food source. When returning from poorer food sources (0.6-1.5 M), foragers of both species decreased sound production, producing shorter sound pulses and longer sound interpulses than they did for 2.5 M food located at the same distance. Thus the temporal structure of M. mandacaia and M. bicolor recruitment sounds varies with distance and food quality. However, nestmates were not recruited by performances for poorer food sources (0.6-1.5 M), whose sucrose concentration was sufficiently low to affect recruitment sounds.

Stingless bees are closely related to honeybees and communicate food location through a variety of different mechanisms, many of which are poorly understood. We show that a stingless bee, Trigona hyalinata, uses a pulsed mass-recruitment system that is highly focused in time and space. Foragers produced an ephemeral, polarized, odour trail consisting of mandibular gland secretions. Surprisingly, the odour trail extended only a short distance away from the food source, instead of providing a complete trail between the nest and the food source (as has been described for other stingless bees).

Like honeybees, the bees accurately estimated the distance to the previously offered food source as seen from the sections of the tunnel where they turned around in search of the food. Changing the visual flow by decreasing the width of the flight tunnel resulted in the underestimation of the distance flown. The removal of image motion cues either in the ventral or lateral field of view reduced the bees' ability to gauge distances.

Using microsatellite markers, we conducted a genetic analysis of space use and resource sharing at several spatial scales among workers of two ecologically dissimilar bumble bee species (Bombus terrestris and B. pascuorum) foraging in an urban landscape (London, UK). At fine scales, the relatedness of workers visiting small patches of flowers did not differ significantly from zero. Therefore, colonies shared flower patches randomly with other colonies, suggesting that worker scent-marks deterring visits to unrewarding flowers have not evolved as signals benefiting nestmates. To investigate space use at intermediate scales, we developed a program based on Thomas & Hill's maximum likelihood sibship reconstruction method to estimate the number of colonies utilizing single sites. The average number of colonies (95% confidence limits) sending workers to forage at sites of ≈ 1 ha in area was 96 colonies (84-118) in B. terrestris and 66 colonies (61-76) in B. pascuorum. These values are surprisingly high and suggested that workers travelled far from their colonies to visit the sites. At the landscape scale, there was little or no genetic differentiation between sites. We conclude that urban habitats support large bumble bee populations and are potentially valuable in terms of bumble bee conservation. In addition, bumble bee-mediated gene flow in plants is likely to occur over large distances and plant-bumble bee conservation requires landscape-scale action.",Article,Scopus

Polistes spp. wasps showed promise, but are limited by small numbers of wasps per nest and short nest life. Social Vespula spp. wasps appear to possess the necessary attributes which will allow their development as manageable, generalist predators of a wide range of pest insects. They have a large number of foragers per nest, a high demand for invertebrate protein, a very wide range of prey, an ability to tolerate low temperatures, a tolerance of nest manipulation, and a colony life cycle that can span at least two summers. High numbers per nest and high nest densities can lead to the consumption of many kilograms of prey per hectare per year. Successful development of characteristics desired of a manageable predator, such as the ability to increase colony numbers by dividing and re-queening, and enhancement of multi-year colony existence, could result in management procedures for Vespula spp. wasps that are similar to those used for honey bees. Farmers could have wasp nests available when and where required and in the numbers desired.

Oxygen consumption of active bees varied widely depending on ambient temperature and level of activity, but did not differ between foragers (&gt;18 d) and middle-aged hive bees (7-10 d). In highly active bees, which were in an endothermic state ready for flight, it decreased almost linearly, from a maximum of 131.4 μl O2 min-1 at 15°C ambient temperature to 81.1 μl min-1 at 25°C, and reached a minimum of 29.9 μl min-1 at 40°C. In bees with low activity, it decreased from 89.3 μl O2 min-1 at 15°C to 47.9 μl min-1 at 25°C and 14.7 μl min-1 at 40°C. Thermographic measurements of body temperature showed that with increasing activity, the bees invested more energy to regulate the thorax temperature at increasingly higher levels (38.8-41.2°C in highly active bees) and were more accurate. Resting metabolism was determined in young bees of 1-7 h age, which are not yet capable of endothermic heat production with their flight muscles. Their energy turnover increased from 0.21 μl O2 min -1 at 10°C to 0.38 μl min-1 at 15°C, 1.12 μl min-1 at 25°C, and 3.03 μl min-1 at 40°C. At 15, 25 and 40°C, this was 343, 73 and 10 times below the values of the highly active bees, respectively.

Here we have sequenced and characterized a full-length cDNA encoding a putative iron-binding transferrin (AmTRF) in the honeybee. AmTRF shows high level of sequence identity with transferrins in both vertebrates and insects (26-46%) suggesting that the primary function of the predicted 712 amino acid protein is binding and transporting of iron. AmTRF is expressed ubiquitously, but particularly high levels of its mRNA are found in the central brain and in the compound eye. Using northern blotting and a microarray based approach we have examined the levels of AmTRF mRNA by expression profiling under a wide range of conditions including developmental stages, septic injury and juvenile hormone treatment. Increased expression of AmTRF is seen during early pupal stages, in the brain of mature foragers and in the abdomen of virgin queens, whereas treatment with juvenile hormone leads to a decrease of AmTRF levels in the abdomen. We show that a transcriptional response of transferrin to septic injury with E. coli is relatively moderate as compared to a dramatic up-regulation of an antibacterial polypeptide, Hymenoptaecin, under similar conditions. We conclude that major fluctuations of AmTRF mRNA in time and space are consistent with context-dependent functional significance and suggest broader multifunctional roles for transferrin in insects.",Article,Scopus

The model may be applied to forage sources with various properties, and to colonies with different foraging-related parameters. In particular, we examine the effect of five foraging-related parameters on the foraging response and consequent nectar intake of a homogeneous colony. The parameters investigated affect different quantities critical to the foraging cycle - visit rate (affected by g), probability of dancing (mpd and bpd), duration of dancing (mcirc), or probability of abandonment (A). We show that one parameter, A, affects nectar intake in a nonlinear way. Further, we show that colonies with a midrange value of any foraging parameter perform better than the average of colonies with high- and low-range values, when profitable sources are available. Together these observations suggest that a heterogeneous colony, in which a range of parameter values are present, may perform better than a homogeneous colony. We modify the model to represent heterogeneous colonies and use it to show that the most important effect of heterogeneous foraging behaviour within the colony is to reduce the variance in the average quantity of nectar collected by heterogeneous colonies. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The probability of bees performing waggle dances after a short travel distance correlates only with the low range of the green contrast of the pattern in the unnel. But it does not correlate with the pattern's chromatic contrast or brightness contrast. Distance estimation is therefore colour blind. We also evaluated the waggle runs as a function of colour pattern. Their duration is the code for the food source distance. Waggle run duration is entirely independent of the colour pattern used, implying that once green contrast is above detection threshold, distance estimation depends solely on the angular motion of the landscape passed in flight.",Article,Scopus

In Experiment 1, the naturally occurring flights of allatectomized bees were tracked with radar to determine whether the deficit is physical or cognitive. The results indicated a physical impairment: allatectomized bees had a significantly slower ground speed than sham and untreated bees during orientation flights, but otherwise attributes such as flight range and area were normal. Flight impairment was confirmed in Experiment 2, based on observations of takeoff made in the field at the hive entrance. The allatectomized group had a significantly smaller percentage of flightworthy bees than did the sham and untreated groups. Experiment 3 confirmed the flight impairment in laboratory tests and showed that allatectomy causes a decrease in metabolic rate. Allatectomized bees had significantly lower metabolic rates than untreated and sham bees, while allatectomized bees receiving hormone replacement had intermediate values. These results indicate that allatectomy causes flight impairment, probably partly due to effects on metabolic rate.

This temperature range occurs naturally within hives. On emergence, the young adult bees were marked and introduced into foster colonies housed in normal and observation hives and allowed to live out their lives. No obvious difference in within-hive behavior was noted between the temperature-treated bees and the foster-colony bees. However, when the temperature-treated bees became foragers and were trained to visit a feeder 200 m from the hive, they exhibited clear differences in dance performance that could be correlated with the temperatures at which they had been raised: bees raised at 32°C completed only ≈20% of the dance circuits when compared with bees of the higher-temperature group. Also, the variance in the duration of the waggle phase is larger in 32°C-raised bees compared with 36°C-raised bees. All other parameters compared across all groups were not significantly different.

Gustatory responsiveness correlates strongly with associative and non-associative learning in bees. We tested whether protein kinase A activity in the antennal lobes correlates with gustatory responsiveness. Thirty minutes after feeding, bees with high gustatory responsiveness had a significantly higher protein kinase A activity than bees with low responsiveness. Ninety minutues after feeding, when gustatory responsiveness had increased in initially unresponsive bees, no changes in protein kinase A activity were found. We also tested time-dependent effects of protein kinase A activator and protein kinase A inhibitor on gustatory responsiveness. Injection of the protein kinase A activator adenosine 3′5′-cyclic monophosphate 8-bromosodium salt or of the protein kinase A inhibitor KT 5720 did not affect gustatory responsiveness within the first 4 h after treatment. Feeding of adenosine 3′5′-cyclic monophosphate 8-bromo-sodium salt over 4 days increased gustatory responsiveness in newly emerged bees and adult foragers. These results enable us to distinguish between two different forms of gustatory responsiveness: basal and transient gustatory responsiveness. Basal gustatory responsiveness correlates with protein kinase A activity and can only be modulated in the range of several days. Transient gustatory responsiveness appears to be independent of protein kinase A activity and can be modulated in the range of minutes to hours.",Article,Scopus

Five genera are found inAustralia, namely Braunsapis, Exoneurella, Exoneura, Brevineura, and Inquilina. Sociality and life histories are well documented for the exoneurine genera (review in Schwarz et al., 1998) and Inquilina is an obligate social parasite of species of Exoneura (Michener, 1965). In this paper, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods using molecular sequence data from two mitochondrial gene regions (cyt b and COI) and a single nuclear gene region (EF-1α) are used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of the Australian allodapine genera. Results suggest that the exoneurine group (Brevineura, Exoneurella, and Exoneura + Inquilina) diverged very rapidly and are monophyletic to the exclusion of other (primarily African) allodapine genera. A clade containing Australian species of Braunsapis is also monophyletic to the exclusion of African congeners. Braunsapis is not phylogenetically close to, and is a more derived group than the exoneurine group and probably came to occupy the Australian plate via a later dispersal through the southern Asian region. It is unclear at this point how the exoneurine group came to occupy the Australian plate and possible scenarios are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

Surprisingly, they often transfer to more than one receiver (published values range from 1.9 to 2.7). Several adaptive hypotheses have been proposed to explain why multiple transfer occurs. One hypothesis, information improvement, states that multiple transfer arises as an adaptive forager-driven process. Foragers use the delay in finding a receiver to assess the relative work capacities of foragers and receivers, performing recruitment dances when appropriate. Multiple transferring improves their delay information. We used a stochastic simulation model to investigate the non-adaptive partial loads hypothesis. We determined the extent to which partial crop loads and receiver filling and emptying rules (i.e. how much nectar to accept before leaving the transfer area) can cause multiple transfer. As many as 1.9 nectar transfers per returning forager were generated within biologically realistic parameter space. We suggest that much multiple transfer arises as a non-adaptive consequence of partitioning nectar foraging between foragers and receivers, but that this will also result in foragers having better information about the relative work capacities of foragers and receivers as a useful consequence. We suggest that the number of transfers caused by partial loads could also be increased by an adaptive forager-driven effort to improve their information concerning the balance of foragers and receivers and we outline a framework wherein the information improvement hypothesis can be directly tested. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We find that the odometric signal is relatively unaffected by variations in the contrast and spatial frequency content of the patterns.

We compared three structurally simple landscapes characterized by a high proportion of arable land and large patches, with three complex landscapes with a high proportion of semi-natural perennial habitats and low mean patch size. Four observation hives were placed in the centre of the landscapes and switched at regular intervals between the six landscapes from the beginning of May to the end of July. A total of 1137 bee dances were observed and decoded. Overall mean foraging distance was 1526.1 ± 37.2 m, the median 1181.5 m and range 62.1-10037.1 m. Mean foraging distances of all bees and foraging distances of nectar-collecting bees did not significantly differ between simple and complex landscapes, but varied between month and colonies. Foraging distances of pollen-collecting bees were significantly larger in simple (1743 ± 95.6 m) than in complex landscapes (1543.4 ± 71 m) and highest in June when resources were scarce. Dancing activity, i.e. the number of observed bee dances per unit time, was significantly higher in complex than in simple landscapes, presumably because of larger spatial and temporal variability of resource patches in complex landscapes.

Previous studies of the Amazonian tree Dinizia excelsa (Fabaceae) found African honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata) as the predominant pollinators of trees in highly disturbed habitats, transporting pollen up to 3.2 km between pasture trees. Here, using microsatellite genotypes of seed arrays, we compare outcrossing rates and pollen dispersal distances of (i) remnant D. excelsa in three large ranches, and (ii) a population in undisturbed forest in which African honeybees were absent. Self-fertilization was more frequent in the disturbed habitats (14%, n = 277 seeds from 12 mothers) than in undisturbed forest (10%, n = 295 seeds from 13 mothers). Pollen dispersal was extensive in all three ranches compared to undisturbed forest, however. Using a TWOGENER analysis, we estimated a mean pollen dispersal distance of 1509 m in Colosso ranch, assuming an exponential dispersal function, and 212 m in undisturbed forest. The low effective density of D. excelsa in undisturbed forest (∼0.1 trees/ha) indicates that large areas of rainforest must be preserved to maintain minimum viable populations. Our results also suggest, however, that in highly disturbed habitats Apis mellifera may expand genetic neighbourhood areas, thereby linking fragmented and continuous forest populations.",Article,Scopus

However, there is currently little guidance available on the types of behavioural data which should be collected during laboratory, semi-field or field regulatory studies or how they should be included and interpreted in risk assessment. Further work is required to allow risk assessment to include significant behavioural effects and their longer term consequences on colony survival and development, Such an approach will require a larger base set of data to predict the longer-term consequences on colonies of short-term effects on individuals, e.g. through population modelling.",Review,Scopus

We studied here one unusual element of their behavioral repertoire: ambush predation. A worker of E. ruidum waits near a nest of a social sweat bee, Lasioglossum umbripenne, lunging at incoming bees, or less frequently, at departing bees. However, bees detected ambushing ants and modified their behavior. Dead ants placed at bees' nest entrances significantly decreased bee activity, indicating that bees recognized dead ants as potential predators. Neither simple black models (square and rectangle) nor olfactory cues had any effect on overall bee activity. A returning bee usually approached her entrance and immediately entered, but if an ant was waiting at the nest, a bee was significantly more likely to abort the first approach flight and then to re-approach the nest on the side opposite the ant's position. As models became increasingly ant-like, returning bees more frequently aborted their first approach flight, expressing other behaviors before entering nests. These behaviors included withdrawal followed by an approach from a different direction; zigzagging flights, either from a distance or close to the entrance or even a close inspection; landing a short distance from the nest, then approaching on foot or waiting for several seconds before entering. Ants responded with effective counter-behaviors. Behavioral flexibility in nest entering/exiting by L. umbripenne and in hunting strategy by E. ruidum shows the complexity of this predator-prey relationship, and illustrates the importance of information processing by both species involved in determining the outcome of the interspecific interaction.",Article,Scopus

Pollen movement has primarily been studied as a function of the direct relationships between plants and pollinators; however, nonpollinating floral visitors, such as some nectar robbers, may have indirect effects on pollen dispersal by altering plant - pollinator interactions. Theory predicts that nectar robbing should have indirect positive effects on plants by increasing pollen dispersal distance and reducing self-pollen transfer (geitonogamy) and inbreeding through changes in pollinator behavior associated with reduced nectar rewards. Here I experimentally tested the indirect effects of the nectar-robbing bumble bee, Bombus occidentalis, on the distance of pollen movement among plants and levels of pollen movement within plants (estimated using powdered fluorescent dyes as pollen analogues) using the self-incompatible, hummingbird-pollinated host, Ipomopsis aggregata. Empirical results did not fully support the theoretical predictions. Heavy levels of nectar (>80% of available flowers robbed) had no effect on the mean and mean-squared distance of dye dispersal within populations. However, hummingbird pollinators were 50% more likely to depart from a population after visiting a plant with low robbing relative to a plant with high robbing, suggesting that pollen dispersal among populations might be reduced in plants with high robbing relative to plants with low robbing. Heavy nectar robbing reduced levels of self-dye transfer by one-half. However, when I manipulated robbing levels and access to self-pollen, the costs associated with increased robbing and reduced pollinator visitation (e.g., reduced seed production) outweighed any advantages associated with reduced geitonogamy. Taken together, these results suggest that the negative indirect effects of robbing on plant reproduction through decreased pollinator visitation and changes in pollinator departure from plants far exceed any positive effects associated with decreased geitonogamy. Given the widespread nature of plant attack by nectar robbers, these indirect effects are likely common phenomena structuring natural plant populations.",Article,Scopus

We investigated the effects of distance and flower density of two flower species on pollen collection by providing nest locations for the mason bee Osmia lignaria in natural settings. Distance weakly affected pollen use; on average, bees nesting near a flower species tended to collect more of its pollen than did bees nesting at a greater distance. Flower density did not predictably impact pollen use, and use did not track changes in density during the season. Bees consistently mixed pollen from more distant species, despite substantial added foraging costs, and also mixed when one species was an order of magnitude less abundant than the other. Bees require nectar as well as pollen to feed their offspring, and our preliminary data suggest that the efficiencies of pollen and nectar collection are inversely related between the two flower species, which would favor visitation to both species.

We then investigated the source of the pheromone and were able to show that a hexane extract from tergites V-VII of bumble bee workers elicits higher activity, like a successful forager does. Extracts from other glands, such as the mandibular, labial, hypopharyngeal, and Dufour's gland as well as extracts from other parts of the cuticle had no effect.

Four bee species were compared for their pollination efficacies on commercial cranberries, using counts of pollen received by stigmas during single bee visits to previously virgin flowers. Differences between these bee species were found to be exaggerated when raw pollen counts were used for comparison because foragers of some species often delivered pollen in excess of that needed to maximize fruit and seed production.

Melipona bicolor and M. mandacaia foragers both recruited nestmates to the correct distance and direction, but differed in their ability to recruit nestmates to the correct height. These differences may relate to their respective habitats. Melipona mandacaia inhabits semi-arid areas of Caatinga where most food sources occur close to the ground, and its foragers evidently cannot recruit nestmates to the correct height. Melipona bicolor, an Atlantic rainforest species, evidently does not communicate height when the food source is at ground level, but can communicate height when the food source is at the forest canopy level (12 m high), where major food sources occur.

I used foraging tests and feeding trials to compare the ability of a generalist and a specialist solitary mason bee species to collect and develop on two pollen species that are not normally used in natural populations (novel pollens). Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) is a generalist pollen feeder; O. californica, is more specialized. Adults of the specialist were more limited in use of novel hosts, but only in some contexts. Both bee species refused to collect one novel pollen. The specialist accepted a second novel pollen only when it was presented along with its normal pollen, whereas the generalist collected novel pollen whether presented alone or with normal pollen. Surprisingly, larvae of the specialist were more flexible than were generalists. The specialist grew well on mixtures of normal and novel pollen species, in some cases better than on its normal host alone. Larvae of the generalist grew more poorly on all diets containing novel pollens than on their normal host. Data on these two species of bees suggest that specialization by itself need not reduce flexibility on novel hosts. The findings also provide information about mechanisms of specialization in bees. Similar to some folivores, specific cues of the pollen host and the bee's interpretation of these contribute, along with foraging economics, to pollen choice by adults.

In this study, I inferred the breeding system of the subterranean termite Reticulitermes flavipes based on colony and population genetic structure as determined from microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA markers. Termites were sampled from natural wood debris from three undisturbed, forested sites in central North Carolina. In each site, two transects separated by 1 km were sampled at approximately 15-m intervals. A total of 1272 workers collected from 57 collection points were genotyped at six microsatellite loci, and mitochondrial DNA haplotype was determined for a subset of these individuals using either restriction fragment length polymorphism or sequence variation in the AT-rich region. Colonies appeared to be localized: workers from the 57 collection points represented 56 genetically distinct colonies with only a single colony occupying two collection points located 15 m apart. Genetic analysis of family structure and comparisons of estimates of F-statistics (FIT, F IC, FCT) and coefficients of relatedness (r) among nestmate workers with results of computer simulations of potential breeding systems suggested that 77% of all colonies were simple families headed by outbred monogamous pairs, whereas the remaining colonies were extended (inbred) families headed by low numbers of neotenics (about two females and one male) who were the direct offspring of the colony founders. There was no detectable isolation by distance among colonies along transects, suggesting that colony reproduction by budding is not common and that dispersal of reproductives during mating flights is not limited over this distance. Higher-level analysis of the microsatellite loci indicated weak but significant differentiation among sites (FST = 0.06), a distance of 16-38 km, and between transects within sites (FST = 0.06), a distance of 1 km. No significant differentiation at either the transect or site level was detected in the mitochondrial DNA sequence data. These results indicate that the study populations of R. flavipes have a breeding system characterized by monogamous pairs of outbred reproductives and relatively low levels of inbreeding because most colonies do not live long enough to produce neotenics, and those colonies that do generate neotenics contain an effectively small number of them.",Article,Scopus

Subjects were trained to enter a test arena where they foraged on a single, red, artificial flower that contained 140 μl of sucrose solution. Subjects were reinforced with a concentration of either 0.50 or 0.20 sucrose solution in 20 trials and in 12 subsequent test trials subjects were given a choice between a red and yellow flower that each contained 140 μl of 0.20 sucrose solution.

These subjects were also significantly more likely to visit the novel yellow flower than subjects that were reinforced with 0.20 sucrose solution in red flowers in all trials. However, the effects of the downshift of reward were transient and appeared to disrupt consummatory behavior more strongly than flower preferences.

The pivoting stamens of S. nipponica hinder nectar-collecting bumblebees from crawling into flowers, increasing the probing time per flower. I predicted that longer probing times would reduce the relative cost of moving between plants, causing bees to leave plants earlier. To test this prediction, I simplified S. nipponica flowers by removing the stamens from all open flowers within a 75-m2 quadrat. Bumblebees probed these flowers more quickly than intact flowers, but the stamen removal affected neither the frequency of flower revisitation nor the flight distance between plants. In response to the decrease in the probing time per flower, bees probed more flowers on these plants. Therefore, in S. nipponica, floral complexity reduces the opportunity for geitonogamous self-pollination. Stamen removal also increased bee visitation per flower, suggesting that this sort of complexity deters visitation.

This plant inhabits the high altitudinal sub-alpine zone, which is characterized by a harsh climate, low species diversity and a short growing season. Echium wildpretii is a monocarpic perennial, producing a 2-3 m column-shaped, red-flowered, nectar-rich inflorescence. Although these floral traits have previously been suggested as being typical of ornithophilous flowers, this is the first study reporting observations of native birds (Phylloscopus collybita and Serinus canarius) in addition to insects visiting the flowers for nectar. The purposes of this study were firstly to investigate levels of visitation by native birds, native insects, and introduced honey bees. Secondly, we studied the influence of floral display (plant height and number of flowers), nearest neighbours (distance and size) and local vegetation structure on visitation rate. Finally, we discuss the evolution of ornithophily in an otherwise entomophilous plant lineage. We found that the level of bird visitation was relatively high early in the flowering season, but decreased in mid/late season, while the opposite pattern was found for introduced honey bees. For native insects, the frequency of visits was similar in early and late season. Bird visits were correlated with floral display. In the early season, visitation rates of honey bees and the two most common native bee species were correlated with size of the plant or its nearest neighbours, consistent with preference patterns for larger resource patches. Since only insects visit the flowers of other species in the Echium clade, E. wildpretii appears to have evolved from a truly insect-pollinated lineage. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

Sci. 77, 138-145). We describe a detailed experimental and mathematical analysis of information exchange and decision-making in, arguably, the most difficult collective choices that social insects face: namely, house hunting by complete societies. The key issue is how can a complete colony select the single best nest-site among several alternatives? Individual scouts respond to the diverse information they have personally obtained about the quality of a potential nest-site by producing a recruitment signal. The colony then deliberates over (i.e. integrates) different incoming recruitment signals associated with different potential nest-sites to achieve a well-informed collective decision. We compare this process in honeybees and in the ant Leptothorax albipennis. Notwithstanding many differences - for example, honeybee colonies have 100 times more individuals than L. albipennis colonies - there are certain similarities in the fundamental algorithms these societies appear to employ when they are house hunting. Scout honeybees use the full power of the waggle dance to inform their nest-mates about the distance and direction of a potential nest-site (and they indicate the quality of a nest-site indirectly through the vigour of their dance), and yet individual bees perhaps only rarely make direct comparisons of such sites. By contrast, scouts from L. albipennis colonies often compare nest-sites, but they cannot directly inform one another of their estimation of the quality of a potential site. Instead, they discriminate between sites by initiating recruitment sooner to better ones. Nevertheless, both species do make use of forms of opinion polling. For example, scout bees that have formerly danced for a certain site cease such advertising and monitor the dances of others at random. That is, they act without prejudice. They neither favour nor disdain dancers that advocate the site they had formerly advertised or the alternatives. Thus, in general the bees are less well informed than they would be if they systematically monitored dances for alternative sites rather than spending their time reprocessing information they already have. However, as a result of their lack of prejudice, less time overall will be wasted in endless debate among stubborn and potentially biased bees. Among the ants, the opinions of nest-mates are also pooled effectively when scouts use a threshold population of their nest-mates present in a new nest-site as a cue to switch to more rapid recruitment. Furthermore, the ants' reluctance to begin recruiting to poor nest-sites means that more time is available for the discovery and direct comparison of alternatives. Likewise, the retirement of honeybee scouts from dancing for a given site allows more time for other scouts to find potentially better sites. Thus, both the ants and the bees have time-lags built into their decision-making systems that should facilitate a compromise between thorough surveys for good nest-sites and relatively rapid decisions. We have also been able to show that classical mathematical models can illuminate the processes by which colonies are able to achieve decisions that are relatively swift and very well informed.",Review,Scopus

The dance language has been hypothesized, but not shown, to increase colony food collection1,9,10. Here we show that colonies with disoriented dances (lacking direction information) recruit less effectively to syrup feeders than do colonies with oriented dances. For colonies foraging at natural sources, the direction information sometimes increases food collected, but at other times it makes no difference. The food-location information in the dance is presumably important when food sources are hard to find, variable in richness and ephemeral. Recruitment based simply on arousal of foragers and communication of floral odour, as occurs in honeybees1, bumble bees11 and some stingless bees12, can be equally effective under other circumstances. Clarifying the condition-dependent payoffs of the dance language provides new insight into its function in honeybee ecology.",Article,Scopus

If the species suffers from inbreeding depression or is self-incompatible, the number of seeds matured per fruit may be limited by the lack of outcrossing by unrelated pollen. We tested for distance-related genetic structure by hand-pollinating plants at increasing distances and measuring fruit set (berries/pollinated flowers) and seed number per fruit in natural populations of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.). Bagging of the flower buds without natural (pollination by insects) or hand-pollination yielded almost no fruit or seed, suggesting that the species are obligately insect pollinated. Self-pollination led to a significant reduction in seed number per fruit and increased seed abortion compared with cross-pollination. Moreover, seed number increased with increasing distance between the pollen donor and pollen recipient. Flight distances of bumblebees were estimated for bilberry by monitoring between-flower and, for lingonberry, between-inflorescence flight distances. About 90% of all flights were at distances of less than 1 m. At this distance, we observed less than the maximum seed number per fruit in hand-pollinations in both study species.

New fossil data, comprehensive information on Mesozoic and Cenozoic coastline positions and the availability of phylogenetically informative DNA markers now makes it feasible to test these hypotheses for some groups of bees. This paper presents historical biogeographical analyses of the genus Xylocopa Latreille, based on phylogenetic analyses of species belonging to 22 subgenera using molecular data from two nuclear genes, elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), combined with previously published morphological and mitochondrial data sets. Phylogenetic analyses based on parsimony and likelihood approaches resulted in several groups of subgenera supported by high bootstrap values (>85%): an American group with the Oriental/Palaearctic subgenera Nyctomelitta and Proxylocopa as sister taxa; a geographically diverse group (Xylocopa s.l); and a group consisting of African and Oriental subgenera. The relationships among these three clades and the subgenus Perixylocopa remained unresolved. The Oriental subgenus Biluna was found to be the sister group of all other carpenter bee subgenera included in this study. Using a relaxed molecular clock calibrated using fossil carpenter bees, we show that the major splits in the carpenter bee phylogeny occurred well after the final breakup of Gondwanaland (the separation of South America and Africa, 100 Mya), but before important Miocene fusion events. Ancestral area analysis showed that the genus Xylocopa most likely had an Oriental-Palaearctic origin and that the present world distribution of Xylocopa subgenera resulted mainly from independent dispersal events.

Habitat requirements of solitary bees include nesting sites, food resources and nesting material. We used translocation experiments to establish foraging distances and measured foraging trip duration t9 analyse how solitary bees cope with the distance between nesting sites and suitable food plants in different habitat types. 2. Maximum foraging distance between nesting site and food patch was 150-600 m for the 16 bee species examined. Foraging distance was correlated positively with body length. Mean foraging trip duration, measured for seven bee species, ranged from 6 to 28 min and was also correlated with body length. In a study of the polylectic species Osmia rufa, we found a significant decrease in foraging trip duration with increasing number of plant species. Logistic regressions showed that the oligolectic Megachile lapponica nested in trap nests with a probability of 50% if the distance between trap nest and food patch was less than 250 m. The oligolectic Chelostoma rapunculi utilized trap nests when the distance to the nearest food patch was less than 300 m. 3. These experiments showed that solitary bees have a rather small foraging range so local habitat structure appears to be of more importance than large-scale landscape structure. All requirements for sustaining viable populations must be within this range. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain and restore a dense network of habitat patches in landscapes to ensure long-term sustainability of wild bee diversity and their ecological function as pollinators.",Article,Scopus

For a given diet, offspring body size generally increases with an increase in the amount of food consumed as a larva, but the extent to which body size is influenced by the type of food consumed is poorly known. Pollen ranges from 2-60% protein among plant species, and bees are extremely efficient at assimilating nitrogen; therefore, it seems likely that either parent bees adjust the size of larval provisions to compensate for differences in pollen protein concentration or bee offspring attain different body size depending on the pollen type(s) consumed as a larva. We presented the generalist sweat bee Lasioglossum zephyrum with pollen diets that differed in protein content and monitored offspring body size during two experiments. In a protein supplementation experiment, diets ranged from 20-66% protein and consisted of Typha pollen amended with soy protein. On a pollen/soy diet, offspring body size increased 25% with a shift from 20-37% protein, but did not increase further at greater protein concentrations. In a multiple pollen experiment, pollen diets ranged from 20-39% protein and consisted of eight pollens that differed naturally in protein concentration. The largest offspring arose from the most protein-rich pollens, whereas much smaller bees developed on protein-poor pollens. Provision size only predicted offspring size when pollen type, and therefore protein quantity, was considered. Adult foragers did not adjust provision size to compensate for pollen protein. Therefore, offspring body size appears to result from a combination of controlled (provision size) and uncontrolled (pollen quality) factors that arise out of bee foraging decisions.",Article,Scopus

These species were chosen for size differences, different social organization, and a wide geographic and taxonomic distribution (Apidae, Megachilidae, Andrenidae, Halictidae). The results demonstrate the following characteristics for the typical compound eye in female foraging bees: (1) the vertical diameter of the eye is about twice the horizontal diameter (2) the eyes of diurnal foragers scale isometrically with body size; (3) the eyes of three species of nocturnal foragers have about 1.8 times the surface area as compared to diurnal foragers of matching size; (4) the number of ommatidia per eye range from about 1000 in Perdita minima to about 16 000 in Xylocopa latipes; and (5) the corresponding mean interommatidial angles range from 4.7 to 1.2°. Body size, rather than species-specific ecological adaptation, is the major (97%) determinant of the number of ommatidia per eye in diurnal, as well as nocturnal foragers. The number of ommatidia per eye, and hence the visual resolution, is proportional to the square root of both body size and eye size across all species studied. The eye parameter (the product of the mean interommatidial angle and the mean lens diameter) increases slightly with decreasing body size. All this is taken as evidence that the features of the bees' visual macro-niche remained largely constant over the roughly 130 million years of their macro-evolution. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The efficiency of recruitment with and without transmission of direction information in the waggle dance was quantified using artificial, plentiful unscented food sources and hives which were turned to a horizontal position to disrupt orientation of dancing bees and thereby eliminate the spatial information from dances. Transmission of location information seems to improve recruitment effect particularly at large distances. Recruitment declines more rapidly with distance if dances are disoriented, and for large distances it takes a few hours before a foraging group is established. However, this shows that even without dance information, foragers manage to recruit some bees to their food source. This process, however, is so slow that by the time a group of recruits has reached the food source, it may not be worth exploiting any more. Transmission of spatial information thus is especially important if distant food sources which often change in nectar availability are exploited.",Article,Scopus

Until recently it was not possible to apply this very powerful technique to study the behaviour of insects flying close to the ground because the strong radar echoes, reflected from ground features and from vegetation ('clutter'), almost always mask the very weak signals returned from insects. This constraint has been overcome, at least for insects weighing more than ≈ 50 mg, by the development of an harmonic radar, and of transponder tags small enough to be carried by these insects without impeding their flight performance. Because the transponders have to be carried by insects in flight, extreme miniaturisation was obviously essential and it was achieved by using a passive, frequency-doubling technique, so that no on-board battery was needed. Transponders with all-up weights of between 1 and 12 mg were produced, the weights varying according to the degree of mechanical robustness required. The frequency-doubled signals from the transponder are selectively detected by the radar so that the tagged insects can be located even in the presence of very strong clutter. The system has three major advantages over conventional visual and video methods of observing low-flying insects. Firstly, and most importantly, its range of operation (up to 900 m) allows surveillance and flight tracking over hundreds of thousands of m2, i.e. four orders of magnitude greater than is possible with conventional methods. Secondly, it provides dynamic and geometrically correct records of the insects' horizontal flight paths and thirdly, it works equally well by day and night.

This variability has not been adequately explained. In many social insects, size variation is adaptive, with different-sized workers performing different tasks (alloethism). Here we established whether workers of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera; Apidae), exhibit alloethism. We quantified the size of workers engaging in foraging compared to those that remain in the nest, and confirmed that it is the larger bees that tend to forage (X̄ ± SE thorax widths 4.34 ± 0.01 mm for nest bees and 4.93 ± 0.02 mm for foragers). We then investigated whether large bees are better suited to foraging because they are able to transport heavier loads of food back to the nest. Both pollen and nectar loads of returning foragers were measured, demonstrating that larger bees do return with a heavier mass of forage. Foraging trip times were inversely related to bee size when collecting nectar, but were unrelated to bee size for bees collecting pollen. Overall, large bees brought back more nectar per unit time than small bees, but the rate of pollen collection appeared to be unrelated to size. The smallest foragers had a nectar foraging rate close to zero, presumably explaining why foragers tend to be large. Why might larger bees be better at foraging? Various explanations are considered: larger bees are able to forage in cooler conditions, may be able to forage over larger distances, and are perhaps also less vulnerable to predation. Conversely, small workers are presumably cheaper to produce and may be more nimble at within-nest tasks. Further research is needed to assess these possibilities. ©2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

Here, I investigate covariation between striking geographic variation in pollinator fauna and the mating system of a widespread self-compatible wetland plant, Decodon verticillatus. Flower visitor surveys in two northern populations from Canada and three southern populations from the southeastern United States revealed that flowers in northern populations were visited primarily by bumblebees (30%), nonnative honeybees (39%), and small, apparently ineffective, pollinators including wasps, flies, and solitary bees (31%). In contrast, southern populations were visited by butterflies (27%), large native bees (Bombus and Xylocopa; 65%), and only rarely by honeybees (2%). The frequency of visits to inflorescences was also much higher in southern (mean = 3.3/h) than in northern populations (1.1/h). The foraging behavior of butterflies may enhance outcrossing by reducing geitonogamy, the predominant mode of self-fertilization in northern populations. Compared to bees, butterflies moved between inflorescences more frequently (64% vs. 43% of the time) and flew longer distances between inflorescences (medians = 50 vs. 25 cm). Despite large regional differences in visitor composition and movement patterns, multilocus estimates of the proportion of outcrossed progeny did not differ between five southern populations (mean ± SE = 0.75 ± 0.04; range = 0.65-0.87) and 10 northern populations (0.72 ± 0.02; 0.62-0.86). Similarly, the fixation index of mature plants did not differ from 0 in either northern or southern populations.

By capturing hive bees that landed at the feeder in a 2-h period, the arrival rate of incoming bees could be obtained. With this procedure we quantitatively analyzed the maximum number of hive bees that can be brought to the feeding station by single foragers. Test bees collected sucrose solution during 12 visits to a rate-feeder located 160 m from the hive. The constant programs offered 0.6, 1.2, or 2.4 M sugar for all 12 visits, while the variable programs delivered either 0.6, 1.2, or 0.6 M or 0.6, 2.4, or 0.6 M, with four visits for each molarity. Results showed that the sucrose concentration exploited by single foragers increased the arrival rate. Moreover, there was a linear relationship within this range of sucrose concentrations that presented a slope of 1.58. Since the sugar solutions were provided at the same flow rate (5 μl/min) in all the programs, the arrival rate expressed in terms of sucrose flow rate (milligrams of sucrose/minute) shows that one additional incoming bee per hour arrived when the single forager assessed an increase in the sucrose flow rate of 0.75 mg sucrose/min at the rate-feeder. The absence of differences in the frequency of visits of the single foragers during the constant programs suggests that the differences observed in the arrival rate can mainly be explained by a more intensive display of the recruitment mechanisms performed per foraging trip instead of by their iterativeness throughout different foraging cycles. Variable reward programs showed that arrival rate is rapidly adjusted according to the reward change and is independent of its magnitude.",Article,Scopus

Additionally, we demonstrate that T. amalthea scouts recruit other workers to nectar baits, however, there is no relationship between the flight time to the colony and either the number of visits prior to recruitment or the number of workers recruited.

Spinosad controls many caterpillar pests in vines, pome fruit and vegetables (including tomatoes and peppers), thrips in tomatoes, peppers and ornamental cultivation and dipterous leafminers in vegetables and ornamentals. Application rates vary between 25 to 100 g of active substance per hectare (g as/ha) and 4.8 to 36 g of active substance per hectolitre (g as/hL) depending on the crop and target pest. It is important that plant protection products are authorized for use only in ways that do not pose an unacceptable risk of harm to honeybees. For this purpose testing was performed to enable the safety of spinosad to be evaluated. The effects of spinosad to honeybees have been extensively researched. Testing has been performed under a variety of conditions in a range of countries globally. Studies to determine the acute toxicity of spinosad under laboratory conditions were conducted to generate LD50 or LC50 values for oral and contact routes of administration. These demonstrated that spinosad was highly toxic to worker honeybees under worst case laboratory conditions and that the oral route of exposure provided the greater risk. Residue tests conducted under laboratory, semi-field and field conditions on worker honeybees foraging on treated foliage indicated that dry product residues were harmless. Therefore the effects seen in the laboratory acute toxicity tests did not translate to a more realistic exposure scenario indicating that safe use patterns for the product can be developed. Semi-field cage studies have also demonstrated that spinosad was safe to bees when applied to flowering crops during periods of bee activity. The majority of studies conducted have indicated that spinosad does not adversely affect honeybee behaviour, brood or queen. It can be concluded that spinosad when used according to the approved product label recommendations, would be safe to foraging worker bees, queen and brood. Additional levels of safety could be achieved by avoiding situations where bees would forage primarily on aphid honey dew.",Article,Scopus

Alternatively, a larger display may reduce fitness by increasing pollen movement within an individual. In dichogamous species the frequency of this geitonogamy also depends on floral gender ratio and pollinator response to floral gender and to inflorescence architecture. We explored the relationships of floral display size and dichogamy to potential geitonogamy in Campanula americana, a protandrous herb. We observed pollinators in a natural population, in which individuals differed in display size, gender ratio, and distance to conspecifics, and in experimental arrays, in which individuals differed only in display size. In both settings, bees responded to increased floral displays by increasing the number and length of foraging bouts. The number of potentially geitonogamous visits, those to female-phase flowers after male-phase flowers, also increased with display size. In addition, although proportion of flowers visited did not increase with the floral display, the proportion of geitonogamous visits did. There was no evidence that dichogamy reduced the potential for geitonogamy. The ratio of male- to female-phase flowers did not affect bee behavior, and bees did not display a gender preference. In contrast to other studies, the presentation of female-phase flowers below male-phase flowers on reproductive branches did not reduce geitonogamy. Variation in floral display size may cause the mating system to vary among populations. We found that display size varied among 12 populations and that geitonogamy may be infrequent in many populations as a result of small display sizes. Finally, within populations, the selfing rates of larger biennial C. americana are likely to exceed those of smaller annual individuals.",Article,Scopus

(Lamiaceae) in experimentally fragmented calcareous grasslands and corresponding control plots at two study sites (Movelier and Nenzlingen) in the north-western Swiss Jura mountains. Fragments (1.5 × 1.5 m) were isolated by a 5-m wide strip of frequently mown vegetation while the control plots were situated in the adjacent undisturbed vegetation. The most common pollinator, the bumblebee Bombus veteranus (Apidae), visited fragments 53.7% less frequently than control plots. Furthermore, a change in foraging behaviour of Bombus veteranus was observed. In fragments the bumblebees visited more inflorescences, flew longer total visiting distances and the visiting time per patch tended to be higher than in control plots. The distribution of angles between arrival and departure direction (turning angles) differed from a uniform distribution in fragments but not in control plots. The increased directionality of bumblebee flight might be due to a decrease in floral rewards. Our results show that small-scale habitat fragmentation can affect plant pollination at two levels both relevant for plant fitness. First, lower visitation rates indicate a limitation of pollinators which might result in reduced seed set of the pollinated plant. Second, changes in pollinator behaviour might reduce pollen dispersal among flowers, increase inbreeding and hence reduce genetic variability in populations of this bumblebee pollinated plant. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The speed at which the liquid is transferred (unloading rate) from donor to recipient is related to the profitability offered by the recently visited food source. Two of the main characteristics that define food source profitability are the flow of solution delivered by the feeder and the time invested by the forager feeding at the source (feeding time). To investigate which of these two variables is related to unloading rate, we individually trained donor foragers to a regulated-flow feeder that presented changes in the delivered flow of solution within a single foraging bout, while feeding time remained constant. With the range of flows used, bees attained maximum crop loads in all experiments. During the subsequent trophallactic encounter with an unfed recipient hivemate, unloading rate was differentially affected by the changes in flow of solution presented during the previous foraging trip at the source, depending on whether there had been an increase or a decrease of flow rate within that visit. Foragers unloaded at lower rates when they experienced a decrease in flow rate, but did not increase the unloading rate when presented with an increase at the food source. Thus, forager honeybees seem to be able to detect variations in the delivered flow of solution, since they modulate unloading rate in relation to these changes, although decreases in food value seem to be perceptually weighted in relation to increases, independently of the time invested in the food-gathering process. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Article,Scopus

Pollination by insects of this order comprises two entirely different sets of pollinators, night-flying moths (Noctuidae or Sphingidae) and butterflies (evidently only one species of Satyridae). These lepidopteran-pollinated flowers have quite different floral adaptations and both types are specialist systems, although moth flowers may be pollinated by a range of different moths. In Gladiolus moth-pollinated fowers are usually large, long-tubed and pale-colored, or mottled dull purple to brown, are usually richly scented, often open fully only at night, and produce relatively concentrated nectar that is sucrose-rich. Butterfly flowers, in contrast, are fully open during the day, close partially or completely at night, are often bright crimson to scarlet, usually with prominent white splashes on the lower tepals, but are also large, have a long tube, and produce quantities of relatively dilute nectar, either sucrose-rich or hexose-rich.

Concurrently, the importance of the natural dispersal of bacteria as a complicating factor was assessed. Tests were performed under two sets of conditions, those that allowed for the dispersal of bacteria via honeybee activity and those that minimized it through the use of translucent polyethylene enclosures around single trees. The enclosures also raised daytime temperatures and allowed for controlled wetting, two factors important to the development of blossom blight. Single-antagonist treatments with strain E325, Pseudomonas fluorescens strain A506, and P. agglomerans strain C9-1 were applied to open blossoms on each of 10 enclosed trees and 10 nonenclosed trees. During bloom, suspensions of antagonists (108 CFU/ml) were applied twice with a brush, and a suspension of Erwinia amylovora (107 CFU/ml) was subsequently applied once using the same method. Two days after inoculation with the pathogen, trees were misted to simulate precipitation. Flower-to-flower spread of antagonistic bacteria was less frequent on trees surrounded by plastic enclosures than on nonenclosed trees. The range and statistical separation of means for population size of E. amylovora and disease incidence among treatments were greater for enclosed trees than for nonenclosed trees. Based on these results, the natural spread of antagonists being compared may mask differences in their efficacy as biocontrol agents. Such distortions and resulting misinterpretations could be lessened by separating treatments widely in large orchard blocks and by monitoring microbial populations. Strain E325 from fresh or lyophilized cultures was consistently more effective than standard antagonists in suppressing E. amylovora and reducing disease incidence.

An alternative signal could be the vibrations of the comb at 200-300 Hz generated by dancing bees but which, without amplification, may not be large enough to alert remote dance-followers. We describe here, however, an unexpected property of honeycomb when it is subjected to vibration at around 200 Hz that would represent an effective amplification of the vibratory signals for remote dance-followers. We find that, at a specific distance from the origin of an imposed vibration, the walls across a single comb cell abruptly reverse the phase of their displacement and move in opposite directions to one another. Behavioural measurements show that the distance from which the majority of remote dance-followers are recruited coincides with the location of this phase-reversal phenomenon relative to the signal source. We propose that effective signal amplification by the phase-reversal phenomenon occurs when bees straddle a cell across which the phase reversal is expressed.

Bee-eaters preyed on bees (foragers) in relation to their mean total availability (calculated over all study areas), but predation on bees occurred also where hives were absent or far away. By contrast, predation on drones was negatively correlated to their mean total availability. Indeed, predation on foragers and drones correlated negatively. Predation impact on foragers was on average 0.37% (range: 0.26-0.58%) of their mean total availability during May-July.

In the case of honeybees, foragers returning from a nectar source transfer the food collected to receiver colony-mates through oral contact. Previous studies have shown that the speed of nectar transfer within each contact (unloading rate) increases when foragers return from feeding sites with higher profitability, i.e. with more concentrated sugar solutions or higher solution flow rates. However, there is no evidence that the nectar unloading rate is actually evaluated by hive-mates during food exchange. To investigate this, trophallaxis between donor bees returning from a feeder with different flow rates of sucrose solution (range 1.0-8.2 μl min-1 of 50 % w/w sucrose solution) and receiver hive-mates was studied by combining behavioural and infrared thermal analysis. The results show that when foraging bees returned from a feeder delivering a higher flow rate they initiated unloading at higher thoracic temperatures and transferred the solution at higher speed. During these food exchanges, the thoraces of receiver bees warmed up faster in proportion to increasing forager temperature and unloading rate. Therefore, whatever the variable actually evaluated by receivers (mostly nectar processors, i.e. bees that handle nectar in the hive) during trophallaxis (unloading rate and/or donor thoracic temperature), they raised their activity level in proportion to that of the foragers. In this way, receiver bees will intensify their nectar processing when nectar foragers return from more profitable sites.",Article,Scopus

To understand how the bee achieves thermal stability at different reward rates, the metabolic rates of undisturbed foraging bees were measured at different Ta values and different sucrose solution flow rates. Metabolic heat production, calculated from the rate of carbon dioxide production, decreased linearly from 49.7 to 23.4 mW as Ta increased from 19 to 29°C (sucrose flow rate 1.75 μl min-1, 50% w/w). In contrast, crop load and inspection rate remained constant. Metabolic rate displayed a linear relationship with both Ta and the logarithm of the flow rate of sucrose solution (range analyzed 0.44-13.1 μl min-1, 50% w/w). Metabolic rate decreased by 3.13±0.52 mW (mean ± S.E.M., N=37) for every 1°C increase in Ta and increased by 4.36±1.13 mW for a doubling in flow rate. These changes in metabolic power output might be used to achieve thermal stability during foraging. It is suggested that the foraging bee might increase its Tth in accordance with the reward rate.",Article,Scopus

The present study investigated the dependence of haemolymph sugar levels in foraging honeybees on metabolic rate and whether the haemolymph sugar level is regulated. Free-flying foraging bees were trained to collect controlled amounts of sucrose solution of different concentrations (15 %, 30 % or 50 % sucrose w/w). Immediately after feeding, metabolic rate was measured over a given time depending on the sucrose concentration, then crop-emptying rate and haemolymph sugar levels were measured. Bees exhibiting a wide range of metabolic rates were compared to establish whether the observed differences in haemolymph sugar levels were due to limits in the supply of sugars from the crop or in the rate of trehalose synthesis in the fat bodies. Independent of the concentration of the sucrose solution supplied, haemolymph trehalose, glucose and fructose levels were constant for metabolic rates from 0 to 4.5ml CO2h-1. At higher metabolic rates, trehalose concentration decreased while that of glucose and fructose increased, with the exception of bees fed 15 % sucrose solution. As the supply of sugar from the crop via the proventriculus was sufficient to support even the highest metabolic rates, the observed pattern must result from an upper limit in the capacity of the fat body to synthesise trehalose. The maximal rate of conversion of glucose to trehalose in the fat body was therefore calculated to average 92.4 μg glucose min-1. However, for bees fed 15 % sucrose solution both the rate of conversion of glucose to trehalose and the rate of sugar transport from the crop to the ventricle were limited, together resulting in a decrease in total haemolymph sugar levels for metabolic rates higher than 5 ml CO2 h-1.",Article,Scopus

By tracking the position of the centre of mass of the bird in three dimensions, we were able to calculate the power required to increase the potential and kinetic energy. In addition, high-speed video recordings of the position of the wings over the course of the wing stroke, and morphological measurements, allowed us to calculate the aerodynamic and inertial power requirements. The total power output required from the pectoralis muscle was, on average, 390 W kg-1, which was similar to the highest measurements made on bundles of muscle fibres in vitro (433 W kg-1), although for one individual a power output of 530 W kg-1 was calculated. The majority of the power was required to increase the potential energy of the body. The power output of these muscles is the highest yet found for any muscle in repetitive contractions. We also calculated the power requirements during take-off flights in four other species in the family Phasianidae. Power output was found to be independent of body mass in this family. However, the precise scaling of burst power output within this group must await a better assessment of whether similar levels of performance were measured across the group. We extended our analysis to one species of hawk, several species of hummingbird and two species of bee. Remarkably, we concluded that, over a broad range of body size (0.0002-5 kg) and contractile frequency (5-186 Hz), the myofibrillar power output of flight muscles during short maximal bursts is very high (360-460 W kg-1) and shows very little scaling with body mass. The approximate constancy of power output means that the work output varies inversely with wingbeat frequency and reaches values of approximately 30-60 J kg-1 in the largest species.",Article,Scopus

This study investigates the impact of logging in Thailand and forest fragmentation in Costa Rica on the pollination and seed production of two self-incompatible forest trees. Logging in a dry deciduous dipterocarp forest in Thailand resulted in reduced densities of the common dipterocarp tree Shorea siamensis and variably isolated individual trees. The number of flower visits to S. siamensis by pollinating Trigona bees was not affected by logging disturbance. However, pollinators did spend longer periods of time foraging in the canopies of isolated trees which were more prevalent in logged areas where tree density had been reduced. Consequently, at the logged site few cross-pollinations were effected and fruit set of S. siamensis was considerably lower than at nearby unlogged sites where distances between flowering conspecifics were smaller. Reduced fruit set has long-term implications for the recovery of S. siamensis populations in disturbed areas, and local population genetic structure is likely to be affected as reduced outcrossing rates among trees in disturbed regions results in relatively inbred seed. In Costa Rica forest fragmentation has restricted the once widespread tree Anacardium excelsum to forest patches located in an agriculturally-dominated landscape. As with S. siamensis, the abundance of pollinators, also Trigona bees, in the canopies of A. excelsum was largely unaffected by fragment size. Nevertheless, pollination success and seed production was positively correlated with fragment size. We propose that small bees rarely move between forest fragments and gene exchange through pollination occurs predominantly among trees within fragments and, together with likely low genetic variability in small fragments, that this contributes to the observed reduced fertilisation and seed set of A. excelsum. Thus increased tree isolation tree through selective logging or habitat fragmentation by forest clearance can result in reduced seed set due to changes in the foraging patterns of poorly mobile pollinators. Even if population sizes of the pollinators are maintained following environmental perturbation, this study shows that disturbance may disrupt pollination processes through changes in pollinator foraging behaviour. More attention needs to be focussed on changes in the behaviour of species involved in key ecological interactions following disturbance events in tropical forests.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Workers often join neighboring colonies by drifting, but long-range drifting (dispersal) to colonies far away from the maternal nests also rarely occurs. We tested the impact of queenstate and taxon of mother and host colonies on drifting and dispersing of workers and on the hosting of these workers in A. m. capensis, A. m. scutellata, and their natural hybrids. Workers were paint-marked according to colony and reintroduced into their queenright or queenless mother colonies. After 10 days, 579 out of 12,034 labeled workers were recaptured in foreign colonies. We found that drifting and dispersing represent different behaviors, which were differently affected by taxon and queenstate of both mother and host colonies. Hybrid workers drifted more often than A. m. capensis and A. m. scutellata. However, A. m. capensis workers dispersed more often than A. m. scutellata and the hybrids combined, and A. m. scutellata workers also dispersed more frequently than the hybrids. Dispersers from queenright A. m. capensis colonies were more often found in queenless host colonies and vice versa, indicating active host searching and/or a queenstate-discriminating guarding mechanism. Our data show that A. m. capensis workers disperse significantly more often than other races of A. mellifera, suggesting that dispersing represents a host finding mechanism. The lack of dispersal in hybrids and different hosting mechanisms of foreign workers by hybrid colonies may also be responsible for the stability of the natural hybrid zone between A. m. capensis and A. m. scutellata.",Article,Scopus

When foragers collect food in a short, narrow tunnel, they dance as if the food source were much farther away. Dancers gauge distance by retinal image flow on the way to their destination. Their visually driven odometer misreads distance because the close tunnel walls increase optic flow. We examined how hive mates interpret these dances. Here we show that recruited bees search outside in the direction of the tunnel at exaggerated distances and not inside the tunnel where the foragers come from. Thus, dances must convey information about the direction of the food source and the total amount of image motion en route to the food source, but they do not convey information about absolute distances. We also found that perceived distances on various outdoor routes from the same hive could be considerably different. Navigational errors are avoided as recruits and dancers tend to fly in the same direction. Reported racial differences in honeybee dances could have arisen merely from differences in the environments in which these bees flew.",Article,Scopus

Genetic polymorphisms of flowering plants can influence pollinator foraging but it is not known whether heritable foraging polymorphisms of pollinators influence their pollination efficacies. Honey bees Apis mellifera L. visit cranberry flowers for nectar but rarely for pollen when alternative preferred flowers grow nearby. 2. Cranberry flowers visited once by pollen-foraging honey bees received four-fold more stigmatic pollen than flowers visited by mere nectar-foragers (excluding nectar thieves). Manual greenhouse pollinations with fixed numbers of pollen tetrads (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) achieved maximal fruit set with just eight pollen tetrads. Pollen-foraging honey bees yielded a calculated 63% more berries than equal numbers of non-thieving nectar-foragers, even though both classes of forager made stigmatic contact. 3. Colonies headed by queens of a pollen-hoarding genotype fielded significantly more pollen-foraging trips than standard commercial genotypes, as did hives fitted with permanently engaged pollen traps or colonies containing more larvae. Pollen-hoarding colonies together brought back twice as many cranberry pollen loads as control colonies, which was marginally significant despite marked daily variation in the proportion of collected pollen that was cranberry. 4. Caloric supplementation of matched, paired colonies failed to enhance pollen foraging despite the meagre nectar yields of individual cranberry flowers. 5. Heritable behavioural polymorphisms of the honey bee, such as pollen-hoarding, can enhance fruit and seed set by a floral host (e.g. cranberry), but only if more preferred pollen hosts are absent or rare. Otherwise, honey bees' broad polylecty, flight range, and daily idiosyncrasies in floral fidelity will obscure specific pollen-foraging differences at a given floral host, even among paired colonies in a seemingly uniform agricultural setting.",Article,Scopus

Social complexity is a broadly used term that encompasses many individual and colony-level traits and characteristics such as colony size, polymorphism and foraging strategy. A number of earlier studies have considered the relationships among various correlates of social complexity in insect societies; in this review, we build upon those studies by proposing additional correlates and show how all correlates can be integrated in a common explanatory framework. The various correlates are divided among four broad categories (sections). Under 'polyphenism' we consider the differences among individuals, in particular focusing upon 'caste' and specialization of individuals. This is followed by a section on 'totipotency' in which we consider the autonomy and subjugation of individuals. Under this heading we consider various aspects such as intracolony conflict, worker reproductive potential and physiological or morphological restrictions which limit individuals' capacities to perform a range of tasks or functions. A section entitled 'organization of work' considers a variety of aspects, e.g. the ability to tackle group, team or partitioned tasks, foraging strategics and colony reliability and efficiency. A final section, 'communication and functional integration', considers how individual activity is coordinated to produce an integrated and adaptive colony. Within each section we use illustrative examples drawn from the social insect literature (mostly from ants, for which there is the best data) to illustrate concepts or trends and make a number of predictions concerning how a particular trait is expected to correlate with other aspects of social complexity. Within each section we also expand the scope of the arguments to consider these relationships in a much broader sense of 'sociality' by drawing parallels with other 'social' entities such as multicellular individuals, which can be understood as 'societies' of cells. The aim is to draw out any parallels and common causal relationships among the correlates. Two themes run through the study. The first is the role of colony size as an important factor affecting social complexity. The second is the complexity of individual workers in relation to the complexity of the colony. Consequently, this is an ideal opportunity to test a previously proposed hypothesis that 'individuals of highly social ant species arc less complex than individuals from simple ant species' in light of numerous social correlates. Our findings support this hypothesis. In summary, we conclude that, in general, complex societies arc characterized by large colony size, worker polymorphism, strong behavioural specialization and loss of totipotency in its workers, low individual complexity, decentralized colony control and high system redundancy, low individual competence, a high degree of worker cooperation when tackling tasks, group foraging strategies, high tempo, multi-chambered tailor-made nests, high functional integration, relatively greater use of cues and modulatory signals to coordinate individuals and heterogeneous patterns of worker-worker interaction.",Review,Scopus

A reproductive female can raise the first generation of brood alone (independent foundation), or a colony can divide into autonomous parts in which the reproductive female is helped by sterile relatives (fission, budding, swarming). In independent-founding ants, queens can histolize their flight muscles after dispersal; in many species, large flight muscles and metabolic reserves reduce or eliminate the need for risky foraging trips during the vulnerable solitary stage. Colony division is a derived strategy, and we review the selective pressures leading to its occurrence in the different social taxa. In various ants, fission coexists with independent foundation, and alate queens are retained. However, in ants exhibiting obligate fission (e.g. all army ants and many Ponerinae), queens are permanently wingless (ergatoid), or the queen caste is missing altogether. When reproductive females are flightless, dispersal distances and colonization ability are reduced, and there are extensive modifications in mating behavior and resource allocation. We focus on the characteristics of fission in the phylogenetically primitive ants Ponerinae in which both ergatoid queens and gamergates occur. The ground-living habits of ants have permitted extensive changes in the phenotypes of their reproductive females, unlike in wasps and bees.",Review,Scopus

Thorax temperature during dancing was quite variable (31.4-43°C). In the course of a foraging season it varied considerably and was always lower than in bees foraging from a highly profitable food source (2 molar sucrose 120 m from the hive). It averaged 38.0°C (SD=2.24, n=224 dances) in the nectar foragers and 37.4°C (SD=1.64, n=171) in the pollen foragers, resembling that of dancers foraging 0.5 molar sucrose from feeders with unlimited flow. Hive air temperature accounted only for about 3-8% of total variation. Foraging distance modulated dancing temperature in a way that, according to the decrease of the profitability of foraging with distance, maximum temperatures decreased and, in accordance with the increase of the dancing threshold with distance, minimum temperatures increased with distance, this way providing new support for the hypothesis that the dancing temperature is modulated by the profitability of foraging and the dancing and foraging motivation of the bees. Dancing temperature of both nectar and pollen dancers correlated with several parameters of the hive status, increasing with the amount of brood and decreasing with the amount of honey and pollen. These correlations are discussed with respect to literature reports on a colony's need for pollen and nectar, in particular the effect of brood and the amount of pollen on pollen foraging, and the effect of honey stores and demand for nectar on nectar foraging. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.",Article,Scopus

A simple and tractable mathematical model of the honey bee scout-recruit system was developed to study the relationship between nectar availability, the efficiency of the honey bee's recruitment system, and the optimal proportion of scouts that maximizes net gain (benefit - cost), or, energetic efficiency (benefit/cost - 1). The models consider both the energetic costs and benefits of active scouts and recruits as well as the cost of an inactive forager reserve. They predict conditions when individual foraging is favored over the honey bee's recruitment system, when the colony should abandon foraging altogether, and the optimal proportion of scouts (when the scout-recruit system is favored). The models' predictions qualitatively match empirical data. Surprisingly, previous empirical data from the honey bee suggest that recruits' costs are greater than scouts' - recruits spend significantly longer searching for a forage patch than do scouts - thereby causing researchers to rethink how the scout-recruit system might be adaptive. Using average returns, the models demonstrate how the scout-recruit system is adaptive despite these apparent higher recruit costs relative to the scouts'. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the results are robust to a broad range of relative costs of active workers, inactive workers, and the energetic benefits of the forage. Consequently, the model is demonstrated to be relevant to many insect societies that employ a scout-recruit system.",Article,Scopus

The mean outcrossing rate of mature fruit embryos in S. leprosula pollinated by thrips (0.91) was not lower than those previously reported from Shorea species pollinated by bees, even though thrips seem to be less efficient pollinators than bees. Although four of the five trees showed high and stable outcrossing rates during fruit maturation, the outcrossing rate increased in one tree with highly selfed embryos of immature fruits. These results suggest that inbreeding depression during fruit maturation as well as self-incompatibility reduce the proportion of inbred embryos. The proportion of fruits dispersed from neighbor trees in fruits trapped under a tree crown had a mean value of 0.20 and was lowest under the tree with highly selfed embryos of immature fruits.

Although travelling farther to harvest a greater net energetic reward is beneficial, many animals opt for a smaller net reward that requires less travel. Recent discoveries of a visual basis for flower constancy in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, led us to examine older reports that colour cues are superceded by energetic considerations. Here we show that when individual bees foraged on pedicellate artificial flowers varying in colour and interfloral distance, their behaviour depended on the colours in the choice test. Colours of similar spectral reflectance (blue versus white), that would be clustered in the bee's visual colour space, elicited more visits to the closest flower when rewards were equal, but individuals travelled a greater distance to harvest a higher energetic reward when reward quality varied. Bees chose the closest flower more often when reward volume decreased while quality remained constant. Yet, even when all flowers were identical (morphology and reward), and only interfloral distance varied, bees did not always visit the closest flower. A dramatic difference was seen when the dimorphism was yellow-blue, colours quite separate in the bee colour space and known to elicit constancy behaviour. Here, bees visited the closest flower only 5% of the time, and varying reward volume did not elicit different behaviour. Animals thus display differential foraging behaviour with respect to environmental cues that must be considered when asking questions about other behavioural parameters. © 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Article,Scopus

Orchis boryi is food deceptive and obligatorily insect pollinated. Primary pollinators were Apis mellifera and Bombus spp., which foraged on rewarding plant species nearby and visited O. boryi in between. To analyse floral colour similarity among rewarding plants and O. boryi as perceived by bees, a model of bee colour vision was employed. For each food plant an index was calculated that described the probability of a bee foraging on it to subsequently choose an orchid flower. This choice probability correlated to colour distance according to the model of bee colour vision, indicating that bees chose the deceptive orchid more frequently if they foraged on more similarly coloured species. At different sites different plant species served as models. Bees foraging on food plants from which a high choice rate to the orchid was observed visited the orchid less often after approaching it than other bees, which is likely to reflect avoidance learning. In general, the pollination syndrome appears to be a generalized form of Batesian mimicry, in which similarity to rewarding plants determines reproductive success. As expected by negative density-dependent selection, individual fruit set and pollinia export rate correlated negatively with orchid density, but were unaffected by food plant density, orchid frequency, individual variation of labellum colour, labellum size, or mouth width of the flowers. © 2001 The Linnean Society of London.",Article,Scopus

Bee-mediated gene flow between groups of self-incompatible plants was quantified using five selection lines of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) with isoenzyme markers. The objectives were to investigate whether pollen flow and consequent gene flow reflected bee patch constancy and how pollen flow varied with distance and vegetation between donor and recipient plants. Groups of five clover plants were positioned on grass/herb patches, sown within a field of barley. Each group of plants contained one clover line. Seed paternity in three cohorts of inflorescences was determined using starch gel electrophoresis. Most (92%) of the sampled seed was sired by plants from the same group as the recipient plant. There was a significant negative relationship between pollen flow and distance between plant groups, and pollen flow declined significantly over time. There was some evidence that a strip of barley between the grass/herb patches acted as a barrier to pollen flow. In conclusion, pollen and gene flow reflected the bee patch constancy observed in a previous experiment, and short distances of separation (26 m) between plant groups led to restricted bee-mediated pollen flow.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Foraging decisions of workers visiting artificial flower patches containing blue, white, and yellow flowers were recorded. We tested whether foragers responded to differences in rewarding flower frequency among flower color morphs. Division of labor occurred among foragers of each race; some bees frequented yellow flowers while other bees from the same hive visited blue and white flowers.

Nectar production of quince was found to be small compared to other temperate zone fruit tree species, since quince flowers contained 1.07 - 0.06 mg of nectar on average. Sugar concentration ranged between 21-27 % on average in different years with a range between 9-47.5 %. There was a significant negative correlation between the amount of nectar and its sugar concentration, but no definite difference was established between the ne ctar production of quince cultivars. In spite of this, bee visitation was highly intense about 5.5 bee visits were counted on average at 50 open quince flowers in 10 minutes and about 9.7 flowers out of 50 were visited. This equals about 7 bee visits per flower per day in good weather. Some cultivars tended to be more and less visited by honeybees. Most honeybees tended to collect pollen (51.6 % in average for the 3 years) and usually fewer gathered only nectar (19.9 %), while the rest had a mixed foraging behaviour gathering both (28.5 %). There were slight differences in the foraging behaviour of honeybees on some cultivars, but these differences were not always consequent in consecutive years. Quince is highly sensitive to partial and/or complete limitation of the insect (bee) pollination period. Complete limitation of insect pollination resulted in no yield and partial limitation of the insect pollination period depressed the final set and yield by at least 60-70 % or more. Significant correlation was established between the intensity of honeybee visitation and the consequent yield of quince.

In an analysis on total diet composition intraspecific similarity was much greater than interspecific similarity. The focal colony of Trigona collina from the mixed aggregation distinctly clustered according to species rather than nest location, suggesting that some interspecific resource partitioning occurs. The sampling period was accompanied by a drastic increase in flowering activity as evidenced by data from a flower phenology transect. At times of limited flowering similarity of pollen diets was generally low, both within and between species. It is hypothesized that this is so because bees are forced to forage from scattered subsets of flower patches spread out over a large foraging range. In times of increased flowering pollen diet similarity significantly increased between colonies of the monospecific aggregation, presumably because colonies concentrated on more profitable sources in closer proximity. In contrast, similarity remained low within the mixed aggregation, suggesting that innate differences in foraging preferences precluded any effect of diet convergence.",Article,Scopus

Few studies have tested predictions about the distribution of genetic variation among co-occurring endemic plants species. We describe genetic variation and its relationship to life history traits for seven narrowly endemic, federally endangered Florida scrub species: Dicerandra christmanii, D. frutescens, Eryngium cuneifolium, Hypericum cumulicola, Liatris ohlingerae, Nolina brittoniana, Warea carteri. These species have varying life histories, degrees of habitat specialization, and geographic distributions. Measures of genetic (allozyme) diversity (mean number of alleles/locus, percentage of loci polymorphic and expected heterozygosity) varied among species. However, genetic variation was generally lower than published means for plants and also generally lower for means for comparable groups (endemics, short-lived herbs, species with mixed mating systems, species with gravity dispersed seeds). The chief exception was L. ohlingerae, which had relatively high genetic variation. All three measures of genetic variation produced the same ranking among species: L. ohlingerae &gt; D. christmanii &gt; N. brittoniana &gt; E. cuneifolium &gt; D. frutescens &gt; W. carteri &gt; H. cumulicola. For six of these species, we compared genetic variation with rankings of eight life history factors. Genetic variation was highest in long-lived, demographically stable, outcrossing species with long pollinator dispersal distances. Attributes such as median population size, habitat specificity, geographic range, and estimated primary seed dispersal distances were not related to rankings for genetic variation. The studied species varied widely in genetic differentiation among populations (0.02 &lt; FST &lt; 0.72). The most differentiated species, H. cumulicola, is pollinated by specialized bees that may move short distances, therefore limiting gene flow among isolated patches. These comparisons emphasize that co-occurring narrowly endemic species can have a diversity of genetic patterns and that many factors can influence the amount and distribution of genetic variation. Further loss of genetic variation due to habitat loss and fragmentation will impact the genetic variation of these species differently. A single conservation strategy for this suite of species is therefore unlikely to achieve genetic conservation goals.",Article,Scopus

Gradients of primary and secondary infection from point sources of ascospores and conidia placed in separate plant rows were recorded in each of 2 years at two sites with no history of the disease. Primary infection gradients were longer downwind than upwind, with 95% of blighted shoots occurring within 30 m of the ascospore point source. This observation, along with a positive correlation (r = 0.852, P = 0.0072, n = 8) between the distance over which shoot blight occurred and wind speed parallel to the row, supports the role of wind as a key factor in ascospore dispersal. By contrast, secondary infection gradients were shorter downwind and longer upwind, with 95% of infected fruit occurring within 20 m of the conidial point source. The shorter downwind spread of secondary infection, along with a nonsignificant correlation (r = -0.649, P = 0.0812, n = 8) between the distance over which infected fruit occurred and wind speed, suggests that factors other than wind are important in the transfer of conidia to open flowers; this could include conidial dispersal by bee pollinators, which have been shown previously to forage primarily upwind. Exponential and Pareto cumulative distribution functions were fitted to cumulative counts of blighted shoots and infected fruit to model spread of primary and secondary infection. The Pareto model, which is characterized by a longer tail and predicts more infection farther from the inoculum source, better fits the observed disease gradients in most cases.",Article,Scopus

Some groups are better known than others, and it is only in these well-known groups that real levels of endemism can be calculated. In some groups endemism is very high, such as stick insects (92.8%), mutillids (90%), Cercopoidea (82%), and Trichoptera (81%). In other groups it is surprisingly low, such as dryinids (0%), agromizids (3.8%), and mosquitoes (5.9%).

Fruit were sampled from trees at regular intervals along transects that extended beyond (either across or along row) each pollinator cultivar and the percentage of seeds that were sired by the pollen donor was estimated using allozyme markers. Seeds sired by the pollinator cultivar were found from seven ('Granny Smith') to 18 rows ('Idared') from the nearest pollinator tree and from seven ('Fuji', 'Paulared') to five trees ('Granny Smith') down the same row. Measured in metres, the maximum pollen dispersal distance was greater across rows (62.4 m) than along rows (13.7 m).

We explored pollination success in experimental isolates of the bumblebee- and hummingbird-pollinated wildflower Delphinium nuttallianum. We established a total of 15 arrays of potted plants isolated by 50-400 m from ten natural ""source"" populations, as well as control arrays embedded within each source. Flowers on potted plants were emasculated, so any pollen received could be assumed to come from source populations. A total of 69 h of observation suggested that pollinators were somewhat less abundant in isolates than in controls, but visited more plants and flowers once within an isolate. Consistent with this, 82.1% of all flowers in isolated arrays received pollen, versus 87.7% in controls. Mean receipt was more than 100 pollen grains per flower in most arrays, and seed set in isolates and controls respectively averaged 69.8% and 74.3% of ovules. Furthermore, pollen receipt in isolates declined relatively slowly with distance from the source. We conclude that pollinators of D. nuttallianum often will fly up to 400 m among populations, and that substantial pollination ensues. Thus isolated populations of this species often belong to metapopulations in terms of pollen dispersal, with important consequences for genetic differentiation, and potential implications for the management of endangered plant species.",Article,Scopus

We examined the genetic structure of 21 C. bulbosa populations in northern Sweden by F-statistics analyses of variation at three polymorphic allozyme loci. Four populations each consisted of two or three distinct patches, which also allowed us to evaluate among-patch differentiation. The inbreeding coefficient over all loci within populations was high (FIS = 0.283). F-statistics indicated that the level of genetic differentiation among patches within populations varied among populations. FST among patches within populations ranged between -0.021 and 0.119 and was significantly different from zero in two of the populations. There was low to moderate genetic differentiation among populations (FST = 0.072). A Mantel test indicated a positive correlation between geographical and genetic distances among populations, but this correlation was dependent on the difference in allele frequencies between the southernmost population sampled and all other populations.

Experiments with bees provide evidence that flying insects might be using optical flow induced by egomotion to estimate distance traveled. Recently some details of this `odometer' have been unraveled. In this study, we propose a biologically inspired model of the bee's visual `odometer' based on Elementary Motion Detectors (EMDs), and present results from goal-directed navigation experiments with an autonomous flying robot platform that we developed specifically for this purpose. The robot is equipped with a panoramic vision system, which is used to provide input to the EMDs of the left and right visual fields. The outputs of the EMDs are in later stage spatially integrated by wide field motion detectors, and their accumulated response is directly used for the odometer. In a set of initial experiments, the robot moves through a corridor on a fixed route, and the outputs of EMDs, the odometer, are recorded. The results show that the proposed model can be used to provide an estimate of the distance traveled, but the performance depends on the route the robot follows, something which is biologically plausible since natural insects tend to adopt a fixed route during foraging. Given these results, we assumed that the optomotor response plays an important role in the context of goal-directed navigation, and we conducted experiments with an autonomous freely flying robot. The experiments demonstrate that this computationally cheap mechanism can be successfully employed in natural indoor environments.",Conference Paper,Scopus

In the absence of selfing, spatial genetic structure and limited pollen flow are generally considered to be the primary controlling factors of the dynamics of biparental inbreeding and inbreeding depression. However, in some cases spatial structure may depend on specific demographic processes. Most theoretical studies have focused on the long-term or equilibrium structure of genetic variation, which allows, if demographic considerations are simple enough, a system to be collapsed into a single standardized measure (such as Wright's neighborhood size) of total pollen and seed dispersal distances. Specific demographic considerations may take many forms and strengths. In this paper we examine some particular cases that illustrate a wide range of effects on spatial genetic structure, and identify some of the most critical parameters. For example, Cecropia obtusifolia is a canopy-gap-filling, dioecious species. Perennially, the highly limited availability of habitat forces the removal of seedlings and the associated strong but ephemeral genetic structure, leaving one or a few trees to fill in each canopy gap. The structure among reproductive adults is minor and in line with standard amounts and forms expected for a wind-pollinated species. In contrast, Silene dioica is a dioecious, bee-pollinated, gravity-seed-dispersed perennial, and a colonizer or early successional species. In certain regions of Sweden, S. dioica grows primarily on uplifting islands that undergo rapid succession, and S. dioica exhibits exhibits extreme levels of spatial autocorrelation, caused by highly limited seed and pollen flow at a specific spatial scale that corresponds to demographic patches. Moreover, the types of genotypic concentrations in space vary, being dominated by matrilineal relationships. The availability of habitat rapidly increases, then rapidly decreases (with analogous changes in population growth rates), and, combined with a long-life, causes the genetic structure to exist on such a time scale that it appears to be the main form of within-population genetic structure for the species in this region. Clonal reproduction may have marked effects on the spatial genetic structure of plant populations. For monoecious, self-compatible species, clonal groups may increase effective selfing, whereas in dioecious plants any effects on the development of IBD may be more subtle. We examine a number of dioecious plants with a variety of spatial distributions of clones and populations, existing for various time scales. The demographics of clonal structure may interact with spatial-temporal demographics and structure of the genetic variation.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Tarsal secretions are probably responsible for this repellent effect. The chemical components of the tarsal glands were analyzed by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for three species of bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, B. lapidarius, and B. pascuorum. The hydrocarbons identified were similar for each species, although there were interspecific differences in the relative amounts of each compound present. The tarsal extracts of all three species comprised complex mixtures of long-chain alkanes and alkenes with between 21 and 29 carbon atoms. When B. terrestris tarsal extracts were applied to flowers and offered to foraging bumblebees of the three species, each exhibited a similar response; concentrated solutions produced a repellent effect, which decreased as the concentration declined. We bioassayed synthetic tricosane (one of the compounds found in the tarsal extracts) at a range of doses to determine whether it gave a similar response. Doses ≥ 10-12 ng/flower resulted in rejection by foraging B. lapidarius. Only when ≤ 10-14 ng was applied did the repellent effect fade. We bioassayed four other synthetic compounds found in tarsal extracts and a mixture of all five compounds to determine which were important in inducing a repellent effect in B. lapidarius workers.

The results confirm that neither the bee species nor the geographical location determine the chemical composition of Meliponinae propolis and the choice of its plant source, respectively. This could be explained by the fact that Meliponinae forage over short distances (maximum 500 m) and thus use as propolis source the first plant exudate they encounter during their flights. The antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of the samples were also investigated. Most samples had weak or no activity against E. coli, weak action against Candida albicans.

Most crops represent temporal foraging habitats with high abundance of bumblebees but mainly with low diversity in the bumblebee forage community, in contrast to permanent foraging habitats such as, for example, a hedgerow. The high numbers of bumblebees in the monoculture of crop plantations consisted mainly of short-tongued bumblebee species. The role of foraging distances for the visitation rate of foraging habitats was studied by performing capture-recapture experiments with natural nests of Bombus terrestris, Bombus lapidarius and Bombus muscorum. Differences were found on the species as well as the individual level. The foraging distances of B. muscorum were more restricted to the neighbourhood of the nesting habitat than the foraging activity of B. terrestris and B. lapidarius. High percentages of B. terrestris workers were recaptured while foraging on super-abundant resources in distances up to 1750 m from the nest. Isolated patches of highly rewarding forage crops, in agricultural landscapes, are probably only accessed by bumblebee species with large mean foraging distances, such as the short-tongued B. terrestris. Species like the rare, long-tongued B. muscorum depend on a close connection between nesting and foraging habitat. A restricted foraging radius might be one important factor of bumblebee species loss and potential pollinator limitation in modern agricultural landscapes.

Lasioglossum (Evylaeus) malachurum (Kirby) is an obligately eusocial sweat bee found across Europe. In western Europe, L. malachurum exhibits north-south clines of increasing colony size associated with the production of more worker broods, and worker production of males, but societies conform to the model of a classically eusocial hymenopteran insect. A population of L. malachurum studied from 1994 to 1998 at Agios Nikolaos Monemvasias in southern Greece exhibits a startlingly different type of social structure. Dissections of female bees collected while foraging on flowers or from excavations of nests showed that the majority of mid- to late-summer workers are mated and (or) have developing ovaries, indicating that some workers are highly reproductive. Nest excavations indicated that in many or most coloniess, the queen has disappeared by midsummer, before ovipositing the final, reproductive brood. In orphan nests, workers become the major reproductives, which suggests that males and gynes in the final brood are the offspring of workers. The very long breeding season in southern Greece may explain why colonies often outlive their queen. The result is the expression of a multivoltine colony cycle and a behavioural switch from eusocial to semisocial colony organization.",Article,Scopus

The median distance foraged was 6.1 km, and the mean 5.5 km. Only 10% of the bees foraged within 0.5 km of the hive whereas 50% went more than 6 km, 25% more than 7.5 km and 10% more than 9.5 km from the hive. 2.

The maximum thoracic value of an individual bee was 44.5°C. At higher T(A) (20.9-27.2°C) head and abdomen were only about 3°C and 2°C on the average higher than the surroundings, respectively. In the lower range of T(A) (13.6-16.6°C), however, the bees warmed their heads up to 29.2°C (13°C above T(A)) and the abdomen up to 23.3°C (7.1°C above T(A); mean values of the measuring periods). The head and abdomen were even provided independently of one another with heat from the thorax. At a higher T(A) only little heat came from the heated thorax into the abdomen, at a cooler T(A) (13.6-16.6°C) more heat reached the abdomen. In all probability, at a higher T(A) only a small amount of haemolymph was pumped from the thorax into the abdomen; the most warm blood probably circulated in the head-thorax area. The average duration of stays at the pond decreased linearly from 110 to 42 s with rising T(A). Head and thorax showed great fluctuations of temperature. For example, the head was heated by 4.6°C within 25 s, the thorax by 6.1°C within 30 s. Foragers drinking sucrose solution are known to increase their thoracic temperature with rising concentration of the sucrose solution. The water foragers had thoracic temperatures similar to that of bees feeding on 0.5 molar sucrose solution.

Trophallactic transfer rate, i.e. the speed at which liquid food is transferred from donor to recipient bee, was found to increase along with increasing profitability at the rate feeder. In the present case, food source profitability could have been evaluated by foragers either by measuring the time invested in ingesting the solution, or by direct assessment of the flow rate of the feeder.

These flights are a prerequisite for successful homing. Little is known about these flights because orienting bees rapidly fly out of the range of human observation. Using harmonic radar, we show for the first time a striking ontogeny to honeybee orientation flights. With increased experience, bees hold trip duration constant but fly faster, so later trips cover a larger area than earlier trips. In addition, each flight is typically restricted to a narrow sector around the hive. Orientation flights provide honeybees with repeated opportunities to view the hive and landscape features from different viewpoints, suggesting that bees learn the local landscape in a progressive fashion. We also show that these changes in orientation flight are related to the number of previous flights taken instead of chronological age, suggesting a learning process adapted to changes in weather conditions, flower availability and the needs of bee colonies.",Article,Scopus

Nesting shelters with known numbers of nesting females were nocturnally relocated for distances ranging from 0 to 240 km, and the numbers of nesting females were counted after each move. Nearly all females continued to nest at shelters that were moved short (0-3 m) distances. Moves of intermediate distances (135-235 m) resulted in considerable (30-76%) bee loss (dispersal), and many females flew back to the original nesting site.

Moving distance was correlated positively with dispersal and with orientation (zigzagging) flights made by females when they first exited their nests after the moves.

Abundance of flower-visiting wild bees was correlated only with the percentage cover of flowering plants. In 240 trap nests, 1292 bee nests with 6066 brood cells were found. Neither the number of bee species nor the number of brood cells per grassland was significantly correlated with the density of honey bees. Significant correlations were found only between the number brood cells and the percentage cover of shrubs. The number of nest entrances of ground-nesting bees per square metre was not correlated with the density of honey bees but was negatively correlated with the cover of vegetation. Interspecific competition by honey bees for food resources was not shown to be a significant factor determining abundance and species richness of wild bees.",Article,Scopus

Bees then fly directly to the food source. However an alternative hypothesis expounded by Adrian Wenner is that these bees search only for odour plumes. My hypothesis is that the dance contains information about the ecological reality in which bees exist which has hitherto not been recognized and which is utilized by bees to maximize their foraging success. If a new, desirable source of food appears, other new locations of the same source are more than likely to soon appear. Some bees that follow the dance may use the distance and direction information to avoid the known location, in order to search in other directions for new locations of the new food source which they will find by following odour plumes. The colony can thus most quickly both exploit the known location and, find and exploit new locations of the same food.",Article,Scopus

The latter mode of cell death did not display chromatin margination, but was accompanied by an enhanced level of autophagic and hydrolytic activity in which a cytosolic source of acid phosphatase became manifest in the extra-cisternal spaces.

Little attention, however, has been given to floral traits, and almost no data have been collected on the effects of fire on pollinator activity and fruit-set. This paper reports the effects of fire on flower visitation rates and the possibly related fruit-set. We compared visitation rates of the main pollinators on four plant core-species in burned and adjacent unburned areas. Measurements were performed at an unburned phrygana (scrub lands), and at a burned area (5-7 years post-fire). Bumble bees and solitary bees were the main taxa of visitors, while few honeybees were recorded. Solitary bees were almost absent from the burned area. Fruit-set was significantly higher in the unburned area for three out of the four plant species. The lower fruit-set in the burned area was possibly the result of low activity of solitary bees which are the main effective pollinators of the examined species. We hypothesize that the populations of the solitary bees were diminished or extirpated either directly by the fire, or indirectly by the scarcity of nectar in the early post-fire years due to dominance of young pine and Cistus spp. seedlings. The short foraging range of the solitary bees and their slow invasion rate into the burned area may explain our results.",Article,Scopus

For all plants the spectrum of visitors is similar. However the role of insects species in pollination is different and depends on the stamen and stigma length, flexibility of pedicle and feeding behaviour of insect inside flower. The possibility to take and to transport pollen grains usually increase with the size of insect. The nature of this correlation is determined by stamen and stigma length. Pollinators of G. palustre with short stamens and stigmas are smaller than those of Ch. angustifolium and G. pratense. On the other hand, more flexible pedicles of G. palustre prevent the flowers from visits of big insects. Three plants studied by the authors are not equally attactive for different insect groups. Dense inflorescence of Ch. angustifolium and G. pratense that usually are lifter under the grass are very attractive for foraging social insects (honey bee, bumblebee). Flies avoid long distance travelling and prefer single flowers located not far from each other. For instance G. palustre is more attractive for flies not for social bees.

The measurement of the risk of inadvertent dispersal of transgenes must include the assessment of accidental dispersion of pollen. Factors to be considered include the rate of pollen spread, the maximal dispersion distance of pollen, and the spatial dynamics of pollen movement within seed production fields; none of which are known for alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), an insect- pollinated crop species. Using a rare, naturally occurring molecular marker, alfalfa pollen movement was tracked from seed and hay production fields. Results indicated that leafcutter bees (Megachile spp.) used in commercial seed production show a directional, non-random bias when pollinating within fields, primarily resulting in the movement of pollen directly towards and away from the bee domicile. Within-field pollen movement was detected only over distances of 4 m or less. Dispersal of pollen from alfalfa hay and seed production fields occurs at distances up to 1000 m. By examining widely dispersed, individual escaped alfalfa plants and their progeny using RAPD markers, gene movement among escaped alfalfa plants has been confirmed for distances up to 230 m. The outcrossing frequency for large fields was nearly 10-times greater than that of research-sized plots. A minimum isolation distance of 1557 m may be required to prevent gene flow in alfalfa.

These foraging profiles were analysed to determine whether they were characteristic of various floral morphologies in predictable ways. It was found that although visitor profiles were sometimes consistent with classic pollination syndromes, these syndromes were unreliable predictors of floral visitors. Very few flowers were exclusively bird-pollinated, and none were strictly fly-, beetle-, wasp-, or butterfly-pollinated. The majority of flowering plants were unspecialized in their morphology, and consequently hosted a diverse array of visitors. In addition, visitor profiles to congeners with similar floral morphologies, and even to conspecifics, differed between habitats. Altitude was a major factor in determining visitors, with flies being the most abundant visitors above 700 m. However, congeners in several genera of Epacridaceae, as well as the genus Correa, which differed in floral morphology also differed in visitor profiles. Tubular flowers were associated with birds, while flowers with more accessible nectar were visited by insects. The only taxa exhibiting a bee-pollination syndrome that were largely visited by bees were the Fabaceae and Goodenia ovata Sm. Several species with purple or pink flowers were also predominantly visited by bees, but did not strictly conform to the melittophilous syndrome. In contrast, other flowers exhibiting an ostensibly mellitophilous syndrome hosted very few bees. Of these, species that occurred at high altitude were mainly visited by flies, while others received very few potential pollen vectors.",Article,Scopus

Molecular studies of chloroplast DNA has confirmed the position of the family in the order Asparagales, contrary to earlier work that placed the Iridaceae in Liliales. The family comprises two large assemblages of species, currently regarded as subfamilies Ixioideae and Iridaceae. The relationships of the remaining seven genera, included in subfamilies Isophysidoideae and Nivenioideae, have been rendered uncertain because of the lack of congruence between molecular and morphological studies using different outgroups and/or different data sets. Ixioideae, the largest subfamily, comprises more than half the total species in the family. Largely African, with fair representation in Eurasia, the generic phylogeny of Ixioideae is poorly understood. Most genera exhibit a considerable range of floral diversity based on floral zygomorphy and the elaboration or reduction of the perianth tube. Production of floral nectar and pollination by long-tongued insects including anthophorine bees, Lepidoptera, longproboscid flies and birds is a recurring theme but reversals to actinomorphy, often accompanied by the suppression of nectar production, has occurred in species of several genera that are pollinated by hopliine beetles. Virtually worldwide in distribution, Iridoideae comprise five tribes, the Australian Diplarrheneae, the Australasian and American Sisyrinchieae, the exclusively American Trimezieae (= Mariceae) and Tigridieae, and the Old World Irideae. Iris and Moraea constitute the major genera of this last tribe, Iris a North Temperate genus and Moraea largely sub-Saharan African. Several small genera allied to Iris or Moraea are believed to have flowers modified for different pollination strategies and have been shown by molecular data to be nested with one or other of the larger genera. Vegetative diversity, especially in the leaf and rootstock, is an important variable in Iris whereas floral divergence and vegetative uniformity characterize Moraea. Genera of Irideae appear to be primarily adapted for pollination by bees foraging for nectar and pollen transfer is passive. Specialization has shifted the pollination strategy either to a generalist system using flies, bees and beetles, or a specialist system using bees foraging for pollen, or carrion flies attracted to foul odors, or hopliine beetles that use flowers as sites for assembly and mating.",Article,Scopus

However, coexistence may be facilitated by prezygotic isolating mechanisms that reduce intercytotype mating and increase assortative mating. 2 We examined the ecological factors regulating intercytotype mating in Chamerion (formerly Epilobium) angustifolium by measuring floral morphology, flowering synchrony and insect foraging preferences in a mixed population within a diploid-tetraploid contact zone. We also calculated the minimum rate of between-cytotype mating from estimates of the frequency of triploid offspring. 3 Diploids had significantly shorter and narrower petals as well as shorter styles than tetraploids. Inflorescences were significantly taller in tetraploids than diploids, but the mean number of open flowers per inflorescence did not differ. Diploid and tetraploid flowering periods overlapped by 51%, with diploid stems flowering earlier. 4 In a plot of 20 diploid and 28 tetraploid stems that were flowering simultaneously, only 26% of all bee flights were between flowers on different stems. Of the total flights between inflorescences, only 15% were between different cytotypes. The combined effects of flowering asynchrony and insect foraging reduced the opportunities for intercytotype mating from 49% expected if mating is random to about 2% of the total number of pollinator flights. 5 A computer simulation indicated that the deficiency of pollinator flights between cytotypes was due largely to the spatial structure of cytotypes and limited pollinator flight distances within the observation plot. The frequency of triploid offspring produced during the period when both cytotypes were in flower was 6.6%, similar to the proportion of flights observed between flowers on different cytotypes (4%). 6 The results indicate that flowering phenology and insect behaviour (as influenced by clonal structure) have a significant effect on prezygotic mating isolation and triploid production, and may contribute to the maintenance of mixed cytotype populations in Chamerion angustifolium.",Article,Scopus

We investigated the effect of colony-level selection for pollen storage levels on the foraging behavior of individual honeybee foragers to determine (1) the relationship between genotype and phenotypic expression of foraging traits at the individual level and (2) how genetically based variation in worker task phenotype is integrated into colony task organization. We placed workers from lines selected at the colony level for high or low pollen stores together with hybrid workers into a common hive environment with controlled access to resources. Workers from the selected lines showed reciprocal variation in pollen and nectar collection. High-pollen-line foragers collected pollen preferentially, and low-pollen-line workers collected nectar, indicating that the two tasks covary genetically. Hybrid workers were not intermediate in phenotype, but instead showed directional dominance for nectar collection. We monitored the responses of workers from the selected strains to changes in internal (colony) and external (resource) stimulus levels for pollen foraging to measure the interaction between genotypic variation in foraging behavior and stimulus environment. Under low-stimulus conditions, the foraging group was over-represented by high-pollen-line workers.

Site shifts within a single day showed a similar range, minimum times of 14-18 min for 300-600 m, and a linear relationship between distance and time elapsed since making (P = 0.001, r2 = 0.41). These data suggest honey bees may provide gene flow to plant populations within an area of 1.8 km2 and between individuals separated by &gt;1.5 km. Further analysis suggests bees sometimes trapline 300-600 m, perhaps without first returning to the nest, but rarely do so for longer distances.",Article,Scopus

Artificially immobilised bees consumed more oxygen (averages: 7.4 and 6.9 μl O2.min-1 at 25° and 35°C, respectively) than spontaneously motionless bees but less than active, freely moving individuals. Oxygen measurements in immobilised honeybees, therefore, are neither suited to determine the basal rate of oxygen metabolism nor to estimate the energy turnover of highly active, freely moving individuals. As was expected from thermographical temperature measurements, oxygen consumption by bees which were free to move within 95 ml Warburg vessels varied in a wide range. At an ambient temperature of 25°C it followed a bimodal distribution, with one peak below 20 and a second peak between 70-130 μl O2.min-1. At 35°C oxygen consumption was always below 75 μl O2.min-1. However, considering the bees' level of activity led to a clear reduction of variability of data. Spontaneously motionless bees consumed on average 3.2 and 4.3 μl O2.min-1 at 25° and 35°C, respectively. In active bees the oxygen consumption rate was higher and related to the degree of activity and ambient temperature. Moderately active individuals consumed 48.4 μl O2.min-1 at 25°C and 18.3 μl O2.min-1 at 35°C. By contrast, fast walking bees had significantly higher oxygen consumption rates: 91.4 and 30.5 μl O2.min-1 at 25° and 35°C, respectively. Since running speed of the active bees was not distinguishable by eye and the distribution of observed behaviours was identical at 25 and 35°C but oxygen consumption was 2.64-3.15 times higher at 25°C, it can be concluded that more energy is invested in thermoregulation than in motion at both ambient temperatures. © 1999 E.

Loss of populations may negatively affect biotic interactions and ecosystem stability. Here we tested the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation affects bee populations and thereby disrupts plant-pollinator interactions. We experimentally established small 'habitat islands' of two self-incompatible, annual crucifers on eight calcareous grasslands and in the intensively managed agricultural landscape at increasing distances (up to 1000 m) from these species-rich grasslands to measure effects of isolation on both pollinator guilds and seed set, independently from patch size and density, resource availability and genetic erosion of plant populations. Each habitat island consisted of four pots each with one plant of mustard (Sinapis arvensis) and radish (Raphanus sativus). Increasing isolation of the small habitat islands resulted in both decreased abundance and species richness of flower-visiting bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea). Mean body size of flower-visiting wild bees was larger on isolated than on nonisolated habitat islands emphasizing the positive correlation of body size and foraging distance. Abundance of flower-visiting honeybees depended on the distance from the nearest apiary. Abundance of other flower visitors such as hover flies did not change with increasing isolation. Number of seeds per fruit and per plant decreased significantly with increasing distance from the nearest grassland for both mustard and radish. Mean seed set per plant was halved at a distance of approximately 1000 m for mustard and at 250 m for radish. In accordance with expectations, seed set per plant was positively correlated with the number of flower-visiting bees. We found no evidence for resource limitation in the case of mustard and only marginal effects for radish. We conclude that habitat connectivity is essential to maintain not only abundant and diverse bee communities, but also plant-pollinator interactions in economically important crops and endangered wild plants.",Article,Scopus

The thermoregulatory capabilities of 18 species of Alaskan bees spanning nearly two orders of magnitude of body mass were measured. Thoracic temperature, measured across the temperature range at which each species forages, was regressed against operative (environmental) temperature to determine bees' abilities to maintain relatively constant thoracic temperatures across a range of operative temperatures (thermoregulatory performance). 2. Previous studies on insect thermoregulation have compared thoracic temperature with ambient air temperature. Operative temperature, which integrates air temperature, solar radiation and effects of wind, was estimated by measuring the temperature of a fresh, dead bee in the field environment. It is suggested that this is a more accurate measure of the thermal environment experienced by the insect and also allows direct comparisons of insects under different microclimate conditions, such as in sun and shade. 3. Simple regression analysis of species and family means, and analysis of phylogenetically based independent contrasts showed thermoregulatory capability, ability to elevate thoracic temperature, and minimum thoracic temperature necessary for initiating flight all increased with body size. 4. Bumble-bees were better thermoregulators than solitary bees primarily as a consequence of their larger body size. However, their thermoregulatory abilities were slightly, but significantly, better than predicted from body size alone, suggesting an added role of pelage and/or physiology.

Bumble bees play a vital role in the pollination of many crops and wild flowers, and plans for their conservation require a knowledge of the dynamics and spatial scale of their foraging flights, which are, at present, poorly understood. 2. We investigated the foraging range and constancy of two colonies of bumble bees Bombus terrestris L. on a mixed arable farm using harmonic radar, which has a unique capability to record the trajectories of insects flying at low altitude in the field. 3. Foraging bees were fitted with lightweight radar transponders and tracked as they flew to and from the nest to forage. The resulting tracks gave information on length, direction and straightness of foraging routes. Superimposition onto a map of the foraging landscape allowed interpretation of the bees' destinations in relation to the spatial distribution of forage. 4. Outward tracks had a mean length of 275.3 ± 18.5m (n = 65) and a range of 70-631 m, and were often to forage destinations beyond the nearest available forage. Most bees were constant to compass bearing and destination over successive trips, although one bee was tracked apparently switching between forage patches. Both outward and return tracks had a mean straightness ratio of 0.93 ± 0.01 (n = 99). The bees' ground speeds ranged from 3·0 ms-1 to 15·7 ms-1 (n = 100) in a variety of wind conditions. 5. The results support the hypothesis that bumble bees do not necessarily forage close to their nest, and illustrate that studies on a landscape scale are required if we are to evaluate bee foraging ranges fully with respect to resource availability. Such evaluations are required to underpin assessments of gene flow in bee-pollinated crops and wild flowers. They are also required when making decisions about the management of bees as pollinators and the conservation of bee and plant biodiversity.",Article,Scopus

The number of active bees showed a positive correlation (P < 0.01) with temperature.

The study was carried out in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada, Spain, over four years (1988-1991). We selected three populations of H. spinosa located along a wide altitudinal gradient. This plant species was visited during the four years of the study by at least 70 species of insects belonging to five orders and 19 families. The assemblage of floral visitors of H. spinosa was composed mainly of ants and different species of solitary bees and flies, although most pollinators were comparatively rare. There were striking similarities between most pollinator species in the distributions of flight distance between consecutive flowers, which were leptokurtic and highly skewed. Moreover, almost all visitors acted as pollinators, depositing pollen grains enough for seed production. Insects visiting flowers of H. spinosa can be divided into two guilds: nectarivores (small flies and ants) and pollinivores (bees and hoverflies), which differ in pollination attributes. Flower-visitation rates were quite different between the faster pollinivores and the slower nectarivores. All nectarivorous species moved almost exclusively between flowers of the same plant, whereas pollinivores sometimes moved between plants; and pollinivores deposited more pollen grains per visit than did nectarivores. H. spinosa interacted most frequently with the nectarivorous Proformica longiseta, Fannia scalaris, and Exechia dorsalis in the two lowest elevation populations of Sierra Nevada, and with the pollinivorous Colletes sp. and Eristalis tenax in the highest elevation population. The mutualistic interaction between H. spinosa and its pollinators is a generalized system, where the traits of the flower allow almost every floral visitor to act as a true, effective, pollinator. The lack of differences in per-visit pollination effectiveness and the functional equivalence of very different pollinators may help to maintain this generalized system.",Article,Scopus

The response of AHB (A. m. scutel- lata hybrid/introgressant) to reward frequency differences among flower colours was examined using artificial flower patches. Each patch contained blue, white, and yellow flowers. When rewards offered by all three flower- morphs were identical, some foragers restricted visitation to blue and white flowers, while others showed fidelity to yellow flowers. Bees visiting blue and white flowers did not show a preference for either the blue or white colour morph under those conditions. However, forager behaviour changed when they were presented with different reward frequencies associated with the alternative flower colours. Bees frequenting blue and white flowers favoured blue when it offered a reward more frequently than white, and favoured white when the reverse was true. That behaviour occurred not only when the more frequently rewarding flower colour offered a higher harvest rate, but also when harvest rates obtained from all flower colours were equal. A change in flower colour fidelity involving yellow vs. blue and white flowers was observed only when reward frequency difference was linked to maximizing harvest rate.

However, prior research has focused on species that can accurately communicate food location. Little is known about species with a weak ability to communicate food location. We therefore examined the spatial communication abilities of a putatively primitive stingless bee, Trigona carbonaria. We trained foragers to one feeder (the experimental feeder) and set out an array of identical control feeders to test the communication of direction and distance. Recruits could find the food source at the correct direction, but this was influenced by orientation to food odor and a favorable wind direction. In trials with scented feeders, significantly more newcomers (71%) arrived in the correct direction when the experimental feeder was directly upwind from the nest. When the experimental feeder was downwind from the nest, a non-significant majority of newcomers (51%) arrived at the experimental feeder. However, orientation to food odor is not essential, since significantly more newcomers arrived at the experimental feeder in the unscented direction trial with rapid recruitment (50 newcomers/hours, 195 forager visits per hour). Experienced foragers did not appear to communicate distance because newcomers (61%) generally preferred the closest feeder to the nest, even in the unscented distance experiments. Overall, our results suggest that recruits can orient to the scent of the food source and may also orient to a forager-deposited pheromone at the food source or follow experienced foragers for part of the distance to the food source. © by Urban & Fischer Verlag.",Article,Scopus

The behaviour of pairs of bees, one (donor) fed with 50-μl sucrose solutions and another unfed recipient, was analysed as a function of the sucrose concentration, the concentration at constant viscosity (kept constant by adding tylose, an inert polysaccharide), and of the viscosity of a 30% sucrose solution. By increasing the concentration of solutions, the rate at which the solution was transferred to recipient bees (transfer rate of solution, in μl/s) increased up to a maximum value for 30% sucrose solution, and decreased beyond this concentration (concentration experiment). At constant viscosity, no modulation was observed for the lower sugar concentration range (10-30%), while the transfer rate of solution clearly increased beyond 30% (concentration experiment at constant viscosity). For the 30% sucrose solution, the transfer rate decreased with increasing viscosity (viscosity experiment). If only the sucrose compound is comparatively analysed, the transfer rate of sucrose (in mg/s) increased similarly in the first two experiments. These results give behavioural evidence suggesting that donor bees are capable of modulating the trophallactic food transfer as related tO the sucrose concentrations carried into their crops within a considerable wide range, but viscosity prevents it. It also suggests that trophallactic transfer rate does not depend on abdominal volume, for even when all donor bees attained similar loads (50 μl), transfer rate of solution increased along with the offered sucrose concentration.

One study was carried out in windy weather in the open, the second in a large greenhouse under controlled conditions. Individual mass-specific metabolic rates from the open-air study varied widely (159.5 to 750.2 W kg-1 n = 7) and differed significantly from expected values predicted from laboratory data. Results from the greenhouse study were closer to expectations and the range of individual metabolic rates was much narrower (405.0 to 485.5 W kg-1; n = 8). The range of field metabolic rates was three to four times larger than that of laboratory studies (Heinrich, 1975; Ellington et al., 1990; Cooper, 1993), which might reflect the fact that only a relatively small percentage (25-30%) of bees are 'co-operative' in laboratory flight cost measurements (Hanauer-Thieser and Nachtigall, 1995; C.P.

Experimental studies were conducted in two populations at Lake Matchedash, southern Ontario, Canada, where the species occurs at the edge of its familial range. 2 Supplemental hand pollination of flowers increased their probability of fruit set compared with open-pollinated control flowers by an average of 57.6%. Pollen limitation was assessed on a per flower basis because the median floral display size at Lake Matchedash was one flower. Pollen limitation was prevalent throughout the 34-week blooming period in one population, whereas in the other it was only evident at the beginning of flowering, despite their close proximity. 3 Bumblebee visits (primarily Bombus impatiens) to R. virginica flowers were infrequent and variable in their occurrence. Visitation was recorded on 14 days during flowering. The median number of visits was 0.65 bees per hour; on 6 days there was virtually no bee activity, but on 2 days visitation rates were high. Variation in pollinator activity was apparently unrelated to local weather conditions. 4 Field experiments demonstrated that the poricidal anthers of R. virginica dispense pollen gradually, with only 10.2% of pollen removed from flowers during a single bumblebee visit. This level of pollen removal is lower than reported in other flowering plants. On average, 47.3% of pollen remained in anthers at the end of anthesis. 5 Investigation of the relation between pollen dispersal and pollen limitation demonstrated a significant negative correlation between the proportion of pollen removed from anthers on a given day and the intensity of pollen limitation. It appears that the pollen-dispensing mechanism of R. virginica and infrequent visitation by bumblebees compromise pollen dispersal, causing pollen limitation in Ontario populations.",Article,Scopus

The question of why this flower constancy exists is a rich and important one with implications for the organization of natural communities of plants, floral evolution, and our understanding of the learning processes involved in finding food. Some scientists have assumed that flower constancy is adaptive per se. Others argued that constancy occurs because memory capacity for floral features in insects is limited, but attempts to identify the limitations often remained rather simplistic. We elucidate now different sensory and motor memories from natural foraging tasks are stored and retrieved, using concepts from modern learning science and visual search, and conclude that flower constancy is likely to have multiple causes. Possible constraints favoring constancy are interference sensitivity of short-term memory, and temporal limitations on retrieving information from long-term memory as rapidly as from short-term memory, but further empirical evidence is needed to substantiate these possibilities. In addition, retrieving memories may be slower and more prone to errors when there are several options than when an insect copes with only a single task. In addition to memory limitations, we also point out alternative explanations for flower constancy. We then consider the way in which floral parameters, such as interplant distances, nectar rewards, flower morphology, and floral color (as seen through bees' eyes) affect constancy. Finally, we discuss the implications of pollinator constancy for plant evolution. To date there is no evidence that flowers have diverged to favor constancy, although the appropriate tests may not have yet been conducted. However, there is good evidence against the notion that pollinator constancy is involved in speciation or maintenance of plant species integrity.",Review,Scopus

Altogether 15 calcareous grasslands with densities of honeybee colonies between 0.2 and 5.2 colonies per km2 within a radius of 2 km around the grasslands were studied. Mean densities of flower-visiting honey bees on experimental plots of Sinapis arvensis decreased from 3.5 up to zero at a distance of 2500 m. With respect to resource overlap, 37% of all flowering plant species were used by honey bees and wild bees, whereas 58% were only visited by wild bees. Species richness and abundance of flower-visiting wild bees did not correlate with the densities of honey bees, but with the cover of flowering plants. Similarly, density of honey bees did not negatively affect species numbers and number of brood cells of wild bees in trap nests.

Thelytokous workers are believed to be unique to Apis mellifera capensis, so that the problem is to find morphological markers distinguishing this race from its A. m. scutellata neighbours. However, no evidence of the expected hybrid zone demarcating races could be found. Factor analysis revealed only one spherical cluster of samples. Trend surfaces of the local mean morphometric factor scores showed a cline that paralleled latitude, with distortions relating to montane and continental effects. Discriminant function analysis implicated certain mountain ranges in amplifying the effects of latitude. Trend surfaces of local intercolony factor variance showed morphometric homogeneity across most of the country. We conclude that there is only a single population of honey bees in South Africa, and that it shows climate-correlated clinal variation. If the transportation of bees for commercial apiculture is to be successfully regulated to solve the 'capensis calamity', further research should focus on the geographical distribution of thelytokous workers rather than on the capensis phenotype.

Flies monitor their egomotion and maintain a straight course by sensing the patterns of image motion that are induced in the eyes. Bees flying through a tunnel maintain equidistance to the flanking walls by balancing the speeds of the images of the two walls. This enables them to safely negotiate narrow passages or to fly between obstacles. The speed of flight in the tunnel is controlled by holding constant the average image velocity as seen by the 2 eyes. This ensures that the bee slows down to a safer speed when the passage narrows. Bees landing on a horizontal surface hold constant the image velocity of the surface as they approach it, thus automatically ensuring that flight speed is close to 0 at touchdown. Flies and bees distinguish objects from backgrounds by sensing the relative motion between the images of the object and the background. Ranges of objects are gauged in terms of the speeds of motion of the images of the objects. Foraging bees estimate the distance that they have traveled to reach a food source by integrating the optic flow experienced en route - they possess a visually driven odometer.",Article,Scopus

This article describes an application of this model in a standard office environment, with unprepared landmarks that may occasionally become invisible or that are easily confused. The corresponding approach calls upon a visual chip that perceives colour and the whole height of the visual field, and upon a matching algorithm that uses colour and proceeds globally, using dynamic programming. Together, they lower the risk of spurious landmark matchings and enhance the performance of the algorithm significantly, allowing it to work without a full 360° panorama and to cope with object disappearance. The performance with respect to the original model of Cartwright and Collett is assessed, both in simulation and in experiments with a real robot. Improvements over previous robotic applications of this model, or its variants, are emphasized. Directions for future improvements are indicated.",Article,Scopus

Dances on open cells are significantly more attractive than dances on sealed cells. Dancers on open cells attracted 90% of all followers from within 27 mm (about five to six cell diameters). Dancers on sealed cells attracted 90% of all followers within 18 mm (about three cell diameters). The majority of bees that were attracted by the dancer were standing laterally to the dancer.

To determine if the bees communicate location information inside or outside the nest, we conducted removal experiments by training marked foragers to one of two identical feeders and then separating these experienced foragers from potential recruits as they left the nest. The feeders were positioned to test the communication of each dimension The results show that recruits do not simply follow experienced foragers to the food source. Height and distance are communicated within the nest, while direction is communicated outside the nest. We then examined the pulsed sounds produced by recruiting foragers. While unloading food, recruiting foragers produced several short pulses and one or more very long pulses. On average, the longest unloading pulse per performance was 31-50% longer (P ≤ 0.018) for bees foraging on the forest floor than for bees foraging at the top of the forest canopy (40 m high). While dancing, recruiting foragers produced sound pulses whose duration was positively correlated with the distance to the food source (P < 0.001). Dancing recruiters also produced several short sound pulses followed by one or more long pulses. The longest dance pulse per performance was 291 ± 194 ms for a feeder 25 m from the nest and 1858 ± 923 ms for a feeder 360 m away from the nest.

This is supported by the observation that the initial orientations of the bees were not equally probable. Departures towards the sun greatly exceeded those away from the sun and the bees also tended to depart in cardinal geographical (or geomagnetic) directions, preferring meridional directions (especially southward) to parallel ones (of which east was preferred).

Bees were trained to fly into a tunnel, lined with textured patterns, to collect a reward at a feeder placed at a certain distance. Their ability to estimate distance flown was then assessed by testing them in a fresh tunnel without the feeder. The results show that (1) bees can estimate distance flown under monocular conditions, performing nearly as accurately as when information is available to both eyes; (2) bees can learn to fly two different distances, where each distance is measured in terms of the image motion experienced by a different eye; and (3) bees that have acquired information on the distance to a food source using one eye can measure out the same distance when they are required to use the other (naive) eye. The need to measure distance using signals from a single eye becomes important when a bee flies to a food source along the face of a cliff or the edge of a forest. Furthermore, under such conditions, it is important to be able to deal with odometric signals that are transposed interocularly when the bee returns home from the food source.

Comparison was made among two bee species, Apis mellifera and Centris tarsata, in their pollination of cashew flowers using a number of measures including single bee visits to marked flowers. 2. Cashew flowering is protandrous within a day. Male flowers greatly outnumber hermaphrodite flowers. Stigmas lose receptivity rapidly and pollen is quickly removed from anthers yet flowers remain intact for several days. 3. Only females of C. tarsata collected pollen from cashew flowers, and then only from male flowers. The similar foraging behaviour of the nectar collectors of the two bee species under investigation when visiting hermaphrodite cashew flowers suggests that they may both act as good pollinators. 4. We develop an index of efficiency of pollen removal from anthers (PREi) whereby the relative benefits of flower visitors to a component of a plant's male reproductive success can be quantified. 5. Comparisons of single bee visits to flowers with unvisited flowers and others receiving unlimited visits were used to show that: C. tarsata pollen collectors were more efficient than nectar collectors of either bee species at removing pollen from anthers; nectar collectors of both bee species had similar pollen removal efficiencies; C. tarsata was more efficient at depositing pollen on stigmas than A. mellifera; both bee species had statistically similar efficiencies at setting seed. 6. The indices of efficiency for some of the stages in the pollination of cashew suggest that C. tarsata flower visits may enhance plant reproductive success over flower visits by A. mellifera but that both bee species may be suitable for the pollination of commercially grown cashew. 7.

Blandus, Densiflorus, Hebea, Heterocolon, Homoglossum, Linearifolius, Ophiolyza) show that 42 species are pollinated largely by polylectic bees in the family Apidae, 2 species by bees of the families Andrenidae or Halictidae, and 1 by a combination of hopliine beetles (Scarabaeidae) and Andrenidae. The floral phenology, attractants, diversity of floral foragers, and sometimes the rewards, vary according to geography and are not correlated with taxonomy. Flowering in most Gladiolus species in the southern African winter-rainfall zone coincides with the end of the wet season, August to October, but a few flower from February to April at the end of the dry season. They have sweetly fragrant flowers with a wide range of colors and markings. These species receive a diversity of floral foragers including bees in the genera Allodape, Amegilla, Andrenu, Anthophora, Apis, and Pachymelus. Most Gladiolus species of the summer-rainfall zone flower from December to April, from the middle to the end of the wet season, but a few species bloom from August to November, at the end of the dry season. Their flowers have no discernible fragrance and are colored mostly in shades of pink to mauve or white. Most floral foragers collected on these species were bees in the genus Amegilla, but other bee genera, as well as flies in the genera Prosoeca and Stenobasipteron, were captured. Among the southern African species of Gladiolus pollinated by bees, there are two distinct pollination strategies. The majority have bilabiate, 'gullet' flowers or 'flag' flowers that secrete sucrose-rich nectar at the base of an obliquely funnel-shaped floral tube 9-20 mm long with the lower, narrow part 5-15 mm long. Apis mellifera and large-bodied anthophorine bees (especially Amegilla and Anthophora) contact dehiscent anthers and/or receptive stigmas while probing the tube for nectar with elongated probosces. In contrast, G. brevitubus, G. quadrangularis, and G. stellatus have rotate, actinomorphic (or subactinomorphic) perianths offering little or no nectar at the base of tubes less than 7 mm long. Andrenu species or Apis mellifera contact both dehiscent anthers and receptive stigmas of G. stellatus or G. quadrangularis, respectively, while foraging for pollen. An additional 53 Gladiolus species also have bilabiate, gullet or flag flowers with obliquely funnel-shaped tubes 9-20 mm long (the most common flower type in the genus), and are presumed also to be adapted for pollination by long-tongued anthophorine and honey bees. The actinomorphic, rotate floral form is present in 2 more species. Thus, 60% of the Gladiolus species in southern Africa may be regarded as being pollinated by bees, and the overwhelming majority of these species (95%) have gullet or flag flowers and are visited primarily by long-tongued anthophorine bees that are foraging for nectar.

When tested against a null distribution using a randomization model, the observed pattern of arrivals for the whole group of bees was random, but departures were clustered in time. Certain individuals visited the plant repeatedly and frequently throughout the day. These showed significantly regular arrival and departure schedules, which were likely produced by traplining. We explored whether these more frequent and regular foragers gained a higher reward than random or incidental plant visitors. Using an analytical model, Possingham predicted that a dominating forager that visited a simple, renewing resource in a regular pattern would garner higher and less variable rewards than random visitors. Inspired by these results, but interested in plant-level visitation, we constructed a simulation model of resource dynamics for a multiflowered plant with high visitation. The model incorporates the observed visitation schedules of all bees and independent reward dynamics for each flower on the plant. We calculated the rewards that observed bees would have collected given a range of resource-renewal parameters. More frequent visitors did not return to the plant when whole-plant resource levels were higher, but these visitors did get greater rewards. Their increased reward resulted from greater foraging efficiency, primarily through selecting (on average) more rewarding flowers than those selected by less frequent, random visitors.",Article,Scopus

The transmission rate of this disease therefore depends on spore deposition by the vector species and preferences for infected vs. healthy hosts. We observed natural populations of S. alba to document the most abundant insect visitors, which include syrphid flies, andrenid bees, bumblebees and a variety of nocturnal moths. using bumblebees and moths in flower preference studies, we showed that bumblebees preferentially visited healthy flowers, but the strength of this preference declined if the bees had prior exposure to diseased flowers. Nocturnal moths showed less discrimination with respect to disease status when plants were arranged in a field population of S. alba, and preferentially visited plants with more flowers. A laboratory analysis of spore deposition by bumblebees showed that whereas most spores were deposited on the first several flowers visited, flowers beyond the 15th visit may still receive enough spores to produce a new infection. Spore deposition was also influenced by changes in vector behavior associated with spacing in artificial arrays of S. alba plants. Models were fitted to deposition data to compare estimates for spore dispersal rates and the initial number of spores acquired by vectors. This study demonstrated several ways that vector behavior can influence rates of disease spread in natural populations. Preferences for healthy vs. infected hosts can cause disease dispersal to vary from that expected by randomly foraging insect vectors. Changes in visitation behavior associated with host density can affect the magnitude and distance of spore deposition in host populations.",Article,Scopus

In spring, M. persicus arrived a few days later and laid up to 2 weeks later than M. apiaster. Spatial distributions of the two species were positively associated. They were sympatric and syntopic: more than half of the local breeding ranges overlapped, and many birds bred within sight and sound of the congener. Intraspecific conflict was frequent, but in mixed colonies interspecific conflict was rare. Most M. apiaster nest burrows were dug into cliffs and most M. persicus ones into level ground, but dense mixed colonies occurred only in cliffs. Burrow architecture differed specifically. Diets were qualitatively similar at insect family level but different at the species level, partly because of local variation in availability and partly because of distinct preferences of M. apiaster for small beetles, ants and termites and of M. persicus for large dragonflies and cicadas. Merops persicus was less specialized than M. apiaster and had an airborne insect prey spectrum nearly twice as broad. Diets were more alike where the two birds foraged together than where they foraged separately. There was a high incidence of egg and nestling loss by predation and starvation. We speculate that each species may prove to breed more successfully in mixed than in monospecific colonies. We propose that the two bee-eaters do not compete for nest sites but may compete for food and coexist unaggressively by trading off food competition against improved breeding success in mixed colonies.",Article,Scopus

The reproductive output of Shorea siamensis, a widespread dipterocarp tree, was assessed in relation to disturbance and tree density at three sites in western Thailand during the 1996 and 1997 flowering seasons. The locations were similar except in disturbance history, which was reflected in decreasing tree density from undisturbed via moderately disturbed to disturbed sites. 2. Hand pollination experiments showed S. siamensis to be partially self-incompatible due to differential pollen tube growth and abortion of inbred fruit. Although more than 90% of flowers from trees at all sites were pollinated, pollen tubes developed in only a small proportion of these flowers. Both pollen tube development and initial fruit production were highest at the undisturbed site. Many fruit, presumably selfed, were aborted during development at all sites, but significantly more fruit were aborted at the disturbed site, resulting in lowered production of mature fruit. 3. Shorea siamensis was pollinated by small Trigona bees, which exhibited significant declines in intertree movements with increasing distance between flowering trees. As resource availability did not differ between sites, differences in mature fruit set were considered to be mediated by changes in pollinator foraging behaviour at differing tree densities. Variation in seed set was found to be negatively correlated with distance to nearest conspecific both within and between sites. 4. At the two least disturbed sites observed seed set values corresponded with those expected by calculation. However, seed set at the disturbed site was significantly lower than expected. 5. Our results suggest that high reproductive success of S. siamensis is dependent upon cross-pollination which, through pollinator behaviour, is a function of tree isolation. This species may thus be subject to the Allee effect, where population viability is reduced disproportionately with a decline in population size or, as in this study, population density. The implications of these results for population recovery and genetic structure following disturbance are discussed.",Article,Scopus

Both species exhibited marked floral constancy when foraging in the mixed-plant community. Because all groups of pollinating insect so far examined exhibit constancy at least under some circumstances, we suggest that this is the predominant strategy used by pollinators and that there is probably a common explanation. Neither syrphid species exhibited constancy to different color morphs within a plant species, in contrast to previously published studies of Hymenoptera foraging among polymorphic flowers, which all describe positive frequency-dependent selection. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. We argue that constancy in these syrphids is unlikely to result from learning constraints on handling ability, currently the most widely accepted explanation for flower constancy, because they forage primarily for pollen which is easily located in most flowers they visit.",Article,Scopus

This tendency was sensitive to changes in distance between rows, even when the distances between rows far exceeded the distance between flowers within a row.

A significant alternation of the bumble bee between rows (zigzag path) was observed in only one condition: when not only the distance between rows was much smaller than the distance between flowers in the same row, but also when the rows were staggered such that the bee could alternate between rows while still travelling in an almost straight line.

These differences in habitat structure may significantly influence the fitness of both plant and pollinator. To examine the effect of habitat structure on pollinator movement and fitness, we observed captive worker bumble bees collecting nectar from artificial flowers containing equal volumes of reward and arranged in two spatial configurations: a hexagonal array with constant distances between flowers ('constant'), and an 'exploded hexagonal' array, with variable distances between flowers ('variable'). The mean nearest-neighbour distance was the same in both arrays, as was the general hexagonal appearance. The experiment therefore compares how resource dispersion, independent of nearest-neighbour distance, influences bee behaviour. Bees in the variable array showed decreased directionality, higher revisitation frequencies, and greater inter-flower flight distances than shown in the constant array. As a consequence, bees in the variable array had a 19% lower gross rate of nectar collection.

We examined behavioral repertoires, behavioral correlates of adult development, and spatial distributions within the hive to explore the mechanisms that produce behavioral variation among middle-age honey bees (Apis mellifera). Individually labeled undertakers, guards, food storers, and wax workers exhibited a broad range of task-related behavior, but bees tagged as undertakers were more likely to subsequently remove a corpse from the hive and handle a corpse compared to other middle-aged bees. The activity level of undertakers was similar to other task groups, suggesting that undertaking specialists were neither hyper-active 'elites' nor quiescent 'reserves' that become active only when a dead bee stimulus is present. Undertakers also were more likely to remove debris and to remain in the lower region of the hive or near the entrance, even when not engaged in corpse removal; both preferences may promote colony efficiency by reducing inter-task travel times. Guards and undertakers were less likely to perform behavior normally associated with young bees compared to food storers and wax workers. Undertakers and guards also initiated foraging at earlier ages than the other task groups. These results suggest that undertakers and guards may be slightly developmentally advanced compared to food storers and wax workers. There also was evidence for lifetime differences in behavioral preferences which could not be explained by differences in adult development. Bees tagged as undertakers were more likely to subsequently remove a dead bee during their entire pre-foraging career compared to other task groups or members of their general age cohort.

With respect to their reproductive ecology, however, these plants appear, very similar to their congeners and to the Piedmont flora as a whole. Except for ant-pollinated Diamorpha smallii, most species show the expected range of pollen vectors, including wind, bees, flies, butterflies, moths and one species of hummingbird. Fruit and/or seed dispersal appears to be highly localised and effected primarily by wind and water. If anything, most species appear to possess adaptations against long-distance dispersal, which would carry propagules into the inhospitable matrix of oak-hickory-pine forest. Mating systems are variable, including examples of both self-compatible and self-incompatble taxa. Consistent with the expectation of low gene flow between populations on isolated outcrops, genetic data show strong differentiation and suggest the potential for genetic drift and/or natural selection to result in divergence. Some of the endemic species on granite outcrops have originated by allopolyploidy, whereas others appear to represent products of more gradual divergence in geographical isolation.

To tackle this question, we recorded handling times and flight times from bees foraging in a natural meadow containing five plant species. Inter- and intra-specific plant distances were quantified. The bee-subjective colors of the five species were determined; two of these species had similar colors and structures, while three species were distinct from all others. The following rules were identified: (1) The decision to switch species was correlated with previous flower handling time, which we assume is a function of the reward amount received at the flower. After short handling times, the probability of switching to another species increased, whereas it decreased alter long handling times. This difference became even greater if the bee had had a run of several short or several long handling times. (2) Constant flights (those between flowers of the same species) and transition flights (those between flowers of different species) followed stereotyped temporal patterns independent of the distances between flowers. Constant flights within live plant species consistently had median durations of about 2 seconds, whereas median transition times between species took 3-6 seconds. (3) This temporal rule broke down, however, if the flowers of two species had similar colors, in which case transition flights had equal dynamics as constant flights. (4) Bees switched more frequently from rare than horn common species but even more frequently between similar species. We conclude that the bees' choices were determined by a set of rules that guided them to stay with the current plant species as long as flowers were rewarding and available within close distance but to switch to another species if flowers offered low rewards or were not encountered at close range.",Article,Scopus

Our result is contrary to the pattern expected if the survivorship of individual honey bee foragers is determined largely by a limited lifetime budget of energy expenditure, which would imply a low probability of mortality early in a bee's foraging life, followed by a sharp increase in mortality late in life, when either physiological or mechanical wear cause death.",Article,Scopus

We examined the propensity of mites to leave their hosts and to move onto new bee hosts. We also examined their preference for bees of different age and hive function. Mites were standardized by selecting mites from newly emerged worker bees (NEWs). In closed jars, 50% of Varroa left NEWs irreversibly when no physical path was present for the mites to return to the NEWs; about 90% of mites left newly emerged drones in identical assays. In petri dish arenas, mites were rarely seen off NEW hosts when monitored at 15-min intervals for 4 h; this was the case for single NEWs with one mite (NEWs+) and when a NEW+ and a NEW- (no mites) were placed together in a petri dish. When a NEW+ was held with either a nurse bee or a pollen forager, 25% of the mites moved to the older bees. When both a nurse and a pollen forager were placed in a petri dish with a NEW+, about 50% of the mites transferred to older bees; nurse bees received about 80% of these mites, whereas pollen foragers received significantly fewer mites (about 20%. P < 0.05). Most mite transfers occurred during the first 30 min after combining NEWs+ and test bees. When NEWs+ were combined with bees of known ages, rather than function, mites transferred more often to young bees than to older bees (1- and 5-day-old bees vs. 25-day-old bees, P < 0.05; 1-day-old vs. 13- and 25-day-old bees; P < 0.05). No differences in proportions of transferring mites were seen when the range of bee ages was ≤ 8 days (P > 0.05), implying that the factors mediating the mites' adult-host preference change gradually with bee age. A possible chemical basis for host choice by Varroa is indicated by their greater propensity to move onto freezer-killed nurse bees than onto freezer-killed pollen foragers (P < 0.05) and by their lower movement onto heat-treated bees than onto control bees (P < 0.05).

In the first part, evidence from navigational tasks with honeybees is presented which favors the interpretation that bees possess a rich and unique spatial memory of qualified and localized objects. Depending on the motivation, the bee is rather free to navigate with reference to this memory. In particular, bees are guided towards feeding places with specific expectations of their signal and reward properties. In the second part, the processes guiding the bee during its final approach to the flower are analyzed. When arriving in the close vicinity of a rewarding flower, bees first detect and recognize the achromatic green signal and then the chromatic color signal. The dependence on the optical signals of the flowers and the habitat features is studied in a comparison between plants growing in the Israeli Mediterranean and desert habitats. We find that the green contrasts of flowers in desert plants are less prominent than in Mediterranean plants because the green signal of the desert background is more similar to that of flowers, not because the green signals of desert and Mediterranean plants are different. These results are interpreted on the assumption that the green signal of flowers used in further distance detection is an adaptive property of plant species only in the context of all features supporting navigation of insects. The low density growth of desert plants may allow for the possibility that the plants are located by insect pollinators as specified places relative to landmarks. Therefore, further distance visual signals emanating from the flower may be less important in a desert habitat, and reduced green contrast does not become an unfavorable property in desert plants. We conclude that both habitat features and flower signals contribute to the navigational system of insect pollinators, and that the evolutionary development of flower signals needs to be evaluated in the context of the plant species' habitat. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus

However, Manasse found that bee-mediated gene flow was unrelated to the degree of aggregation among the plants in the linear arrays that be studied. To investigate this apparent contradiction further, I manipulated the levels of aggregation in linear plant arrays and examined both the effect of the movements of the bumblebee pollinators and the likely consequences for pollen dispersal and gene flow. I studied pollinator movements among plants of oil-seed rape (Brassica napus ev. Westar) that were arranged in rows that each contained 50 plants. In each experiment one row of plants was spaced at uniform intervals and the remaining rows contained aggregated plant distributions. Experiments were conducted at two scales, short rows (10 ml) and long rows (20 m). The plants were visited almost exclusively by worker caste individuals of Bombus lapidarius. Bumblebees were followed over successive visits within a row and location of each visited plant and the number of flowers probed there was recorded. Within each row, I examined the following components of bumblebee behaviour; the mean number of flowers probed per plant visit; the meant interplant flight distance; and the mean directionality (proportion of moves in an individual's favoured direction). The collective movements of bumblebees within each row were characterised by the rate of change of the bees mean squared distance from an original location. The spatial dispersion of pollen from a paternal plant was estimated in each row by combining a quantitative description of bumblebee movements in terms of displacement from a paternal plant with a model of pollen deposition. Bumblebees were observed to visit many plants successively within a row and movements between rows were infrequent. In both long and short rows, three components of bumblebee movement behaviour were significantly modified by the level of plant aggregation. With increasing plant aggregation, bumblebees exhibited a decrease in directionality and in the number of flowers probed per plant visit and they exhibited an increase in the number of plants by-passed during interplant flights. Despite the effect of plant aggregation on the components of bumblebee behaviour, the bumblebees collective rate of movement away from an origin within a row was unrelated to the level of plant aggregation. This was consistent with the finding that plant aggregation did not significantly affect either the estimates of mean pollen dispersal distances measured in metres or a plant's expected number of female mates. The modifications to bumblebee behaviour that were caused by differential aggregation among rows apparently combined, fortuitously, to buffer the spatial extent of pollen dispersal. Consequently, my results are consistent with heterogeneity at these scales. However, I also conclude that the effects of plant aggregation on gene flow will depend on the spatial scale of the inter-patch distances.",Article,Scopus

Now for 25 years animal behaviorists have worked as, or with, pollination biologists, using a range of behavioral techniques and models, to dissect and understand pollinator foraging behavior. Foragers must make decisions and choose among flowers on each departure from a flower. The choice may be of which flower to visit on the same plant or a flower of the same or different species. My work has focused on how foragers acquire information about floral characteristics and cost-gain associations, the internal representation of this information, and how the representation is used to make choices. This foraging process is illustrated through 1) studies of honey bees' subjective evaluations of costs and gains and 2) studies of choice behavior based on expected intakes of food and variation in nectar volume and concentration (risk-sensitive foraging behavior). I will focus also on the neglected area of genetically based variation in foraging behavior. In honey bees, nearly all aspects of foraging behavior studied thus far, including perception of and preferences for pollen and nectar, have a genetic component. Studies of the relationships between information available in the environment (floral color and scent, nectar distribution), mechanisms which underlie assessment of the information (perception, learning), resulting choice behavior, and the genetic contribution to these will further our understanding of pollinator behavior and its evolution.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Seven RAPD primers were used to detect polymorphisms in the population. Differences between subpopulations in fragment frequency were found for several of the 45 polymorphic RAPD fragments scored. Population subdivision was evident from cluster analysis, and an analysis of genetic distances showed that there was significant genetic differentiation between all subpopulations.

Bumblebees consistently showed a preference for the commonest colour morph, and this behaviour was not significantly affected by changing density. In contrast, frequency-independent preferences changes significantly with density. At low densities, there was a strong bias towards the more conspicuous colour, whereas at higher densities there was no overall colour bias. Flight distances between flowers decreased significantly at high density. Bumblebees also visited flowers of similar colours sequentially, but this behaviour was not density-dependent. It is suggested that as densities increase, there is an increased probability that bumblebees detect yellow flowers, which were probably less conspicuous compared with blue flowers, and that this might be caused by changes in flight speed with flight distance. Where there is a positive relationship between pollinator visitation and the relative fitness of a floral morph, the observed behaviour would induce positive frequency-dependent selection on a plant population with two corolla colour morphs on which the bumblebees were foraging, which would result in stabilizing selection for a single corolla colour, irrespective of density.

The very poor transmission properties of the large framed combs used in commercial hives may explain the bees' habit of freeing an area of comb from the frame in those areas used for dancing. Extracellular electrical recordings from the leg of a honeybee detect large action potentials from receptors that monitor extension of the tibia on the femur.

These patterns may be innate, or they may be learned through the bees' early foraging experience. To identify the innate components of foraging rules, we characterized the flight of naive bumblebees, foraging on a non-patchy 'field' of randomly scattered artificial flowers with three color displays. The flowers were randomly mixed and all three flower types offered equal nectar volumes. Visited flowers were refilled with probability 0.5. Flight distances, flight durations and nectar probing durations were determined and related to the bees' recent experiences. The naive bees exhibited area-restricted search behavior, i.e., flew shorter distances following visits to rewarding flowers than after visits to empty flowers. Additionally, flight distances during flower-type transitions were longer than flight distances between flowers of the same type. The two movement titles operated together: flight distances were longest for flights between flower types following non-rewarding visits, shortest for within-type flights following rewarding visits. An increase in flight displacement during flower-type shifts was also observed in a second experiment, in which all three types were always rewarding. In this experiment, flower-type shifts were also accompanied by an increase in flight duration. Possible relationships between flight distances, flight durations and flower-type choice are discussed.",Article,Scopus

The former is endemic to the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province, and the latter occupies southern China. Their morphological differences were associated with their different breeding systems indicated by pollen-ovule ratio (P/O). M. hangchouensis was predominantly outcrossing with P/O ranging from 756 to 6163 due to the variation among populations. Floral characters also showed that M. hangchouensis is an outcrosser: corolla tube 5∼10 mm long. 3∼5 mm wide, bright red; style 6∼15 mm long; stigma 1. 5∼2. 0 mm horizontally away from anthers. On the contrary. M. chinensis was predominantly a selfer with a low P/O ratio (P/O= 110). Its floral parameters contrasted sharply with M. hangchouensis: corolla tube 3. 0 mm long, 1. 0∼1. 5 mm wide, pale colored: style 2. 5 mm long, stigma close to or touching anthers. The pollinators of M. hangchouensis most frequently seen are: Bambus trifascitus Smith. , Scolia spp., Apis cerana Fabricius, Hylaeus sp. and Lasioglossum spp. These pollinators began to visit flowers at about 8 : 00 am, when flower buds were ready to open. When insects entered corolla tube for honey and (or) pollen, the stigmata touched the insects' body hairs to which pollen grains adhered, and pollen grains were transferred to the stigmata. Meanwhile the hairs collected pollen from anthers under the upper lips of corolla as the insects thrusted their bodies forward. Bumble bees and honey bees were considered more efficient pollinators because they were hair-rich and their body size fitted corolla tube fairly well. Due to the short flight distance of pollinators between two visits (average flight distances of honey bees and solitary bees were 0. 52 m and 0. 32 m respectively), pollen dispersal was probably restricted. Pollen vectors were important for the reproductive success of M. hangchouensis because 84. 3% of its seed-set depended on the pollinators' visitation. Although insects did pay visits to M. chinensis occasionally, such visitation was insignificant in seed-set due to cleistogamy. Discussions are made on the evolutionary significance of breeding system divergence between M. hangchouensis and M. chinensis, and the contribution of studies on pollination biology to conservation biology. Further studies are suggested for more thorough understanding of pollination biology of M. hangchouensis.",Review,Scopus

Here, the major pollinators were queens of the short-tongued opportunistic Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae) that had newly emerged from hibernation. Flowering of the C. cave population lasted 39 days, with a peak on the 14th day. During the first 14 days of the flowering period, bumblebees collected pollen (i.e., pollinated), performed the flower spur and robbed the nectar (i.e., primary nectar-robbery). Over the first nine of these days, they perforated the flower spur at random. Then, during the following five days, they learned to locate the nectar and placed most holes in spurs where the surface of the nectar was located. After having perforated most of the flowers, queens changed their behavior to the slightly faster method of secondary nectar-robbing, i.e., using old nectar-robbing holes. Thus, plants with a specialized floral morphology which indicates a tight evolutionary history with specialist pollinators may survive without these specialists at their range margin through pollination interactions with oppurtunistic flower foragers.",Article,Scopus

In bees foraging 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 molar sucrose solutions from a distance of 120 m, dancing temperature amounted to 38.4, 40.1, 40.9 and 40.6°C, respectively; while in bees foraging from a distance of 2950 m it amounted to 36.6, 38.4, 38.6 and 39.1 °C, respectively.

Both at short and at long flight distances, the relationship between thoracic temperature and sucrose concentration of the food followed a non-linear curve, which flattened at concentrations higher than 1 mol/l. The experiments showed that inside the hive the foragers' level of thermoregulation depends not only on the energy (sugar) content of the food; but rather, the level of thermoregulation corresponds to the general quality of the food source, which includes both energy content and distance from the hive.

However, a critical review of this 'energy hypothesis' reveals many inconsistencies in the experiments from which it was derived. In fact, new evidence shows that the energy hypothesis cannot be correct. Foragers loaded with weights do not overestimate distance, as indicated by their waggle dances performed upon return to the hive. Bees that climb to a feeder on top of a high building (50 m) signal the same distance as hive mates that visit an equidistant feeder at ground level. Foragers visiting a feeder suspended from a balloon at 70 m from their hive underestimate the distance flown dramatically when the balloon lifts the feeder from ground level to 90m, even though the energy required to reach the feeder increases considerably. Foragers from a hive situated on a high building (50 m) that fly to a feeder on the roof of another high building (34 m) signal a much shorter distance than the actual distance flown. We propose instead an 'Optical flow hypothesis': bees use the speed of retinal image motion perceived from the ground to estimate the distance flown. Flight altitude is important for distance estimation by retinal image flow, because objects move faster and farther across the retina when the bee flies closer to the ground. When the forager's flight behavior is considered, the optical flow hypothesis does not conflict with previous findings.",Article,Scopus

The Australian allodapine bee Exoneura bicolor exhibits a number of traits that occur in cooperatively breeding bird species, including long life-span, repeated opportunities for reproduction, and vulnerability to brood predation and parasitism. We experimentally examined the effect of a potentially limiting environmental factor, nesting substrate availability, as an agent influencing sociality in E. bicolor. We manipulated nesting substrate availability in two separate locations during a time when foundress dispersal is common. No significant difference was found between colony sizes in cases where dispersal options were abundant and cases where dispersal options were limited. An increase in opportunities for dispersal did not lead to higher rates of independent nesting, suggesting that cooperative nesting is a preferred strategy regardless of distance-related costs of dispersal.

When the substrate moved against, or the pattern in the bee's direction, in either case decreasing the speed of pattern flow (PFS), the bees increased WS, and, at the same time, they preferred the more distant exit.

By this measure, 31 species (43%) were oligolectic (relatively specialized to pollen source) at the level of plant tribe, plant subfamily, or plant family. Exclusive pollen sources of these bees throughout their geographic ranges are flowers of the Cardueae (Compositae), the Asteroideae (Compositae), the Papilionoideae (Leguminosae), the Lamioideae (Labiatae), the Nepetoideae (Labiatae), the Dipsacaceae, or the Campanulaceae. Thirteen species (18%) were found to exhibit a strong, but not exclusive, preference for the Papilionoideae (Leguminosae), the Labiatae, the Cardueae (Compositae), and Zygophyllum (Zygophyllaceae), respectively, while 25 species (35%) proved to be more markedly polylectic, visiting the flowers of up to 17 different plant families for pollen. The plants exploited by three species (4%) are insufficiently known. By far the most important pollen sources of the anthidiine bees as a whole are the Compositae (41.7%) followed by the Leguminosae (23.1%) and the Labiatae (13.0%). The phylogenetic relationships of the anthidiine bees were estimated by a cladistic analysis based on 115 characters to trace possible evolutionary patterns of diet composition. Based on the estimated phylogeny, at least eight shifts of oligoleges between different plant taxa and six transitions between oligolecty and polylecty appear to have occurred. Four transitions were from oligolecty to polylecty whereas two transitions are of unknown direction, both directions being equally parsimonious. Assuming that the ancestral state in the anthidiine bees was oligolectic, the present distribution of oligolectic and polylectic species can be explained solely by switches from the oligolectic to the polylectic habit and by shifts of oligoleges between different plant taxa. Three of four transitions from oligolecty to polylecty are accompanied by a reduction in bee body size. The significance of this size reduction with respect to the polylectic habit is discussed. The oligolectic anthidiine species visit significantly fewer flower species for pollen during a single foraging bout than the polylectic species. On average, 1.4 plant species were recorded in the loads of specialists compared to 2.2 for generalists. Two monophyletic groups of bees belonging to the genus Anthidium are equipped with a pollen-collecting apparatus consisting of specialized hairs localized either on the face or on the underside of the thorax. It is used to remove pollen from the raised anthers of flowers of the Labiatae and the Scrophulariaceae and to brush pollen from the flat inflorescences of some Compositae, respectively. The observation of flower-visiting females of several anthidiine species revealed that pollen uptake is far from an accidental process. Basic pollen-harvesting techniques have reached a high degree of efficiency: females of a given bee species worked flowers of a certain plant species in a fixed manner, the structures used for pollen uptake from the same flower type were found to be largely the same among anthidiine bees of different taxonomic groups, and no distinct differences with respect to the basic pattern of pollen removal from flowers of the same architecture were obvious when comparing oligolectic and polylectic species. On the other hand, polyleges showed a high intraspecific flexibility regarding the organs used for pollen uptake from flowers of a different architecture.",Article,Scopus

Nests occurred predominantly in wooden cavities, particularly in abandoned woodpecker nests in dead palm trees. Nest cavities had a volume of ≃33 liters and south-facing, top-located entrances.

Thus, the aspects of nesting biology examined appear to have remained largely unchanged from the ancestral African condition during the colonization of Central and South America.",Article,Scopus

(2) maintain the critical ecological and evolutionary processes upon which these species depend, and (3) preserve the full range of communities, successional stages, and environmental gradients. To achieve these objectives, wilderness areas should be selected so as to protect large, contiguous areas, augment existing protected areas, buffer wilderness areas with multiple-use public lands, interconnect existing protected areas with dispersal and movement corridors, conserve entire watersheds and elevational gradients, protect native communities from invasions of exotic species, protect sites of maximum species diversity, protect sites with rare and endemic species, and protect habitats of threatened and endangered species.

The feeding of workers at feeders was monitored during consecutive days under these variable resource conditions. Scouts marked all the sugar-solution feeders with a visible fluid, and the degree of marking and nestmate recruitment was positively correlated with sugar concentration. Workers exhibited characteristics of the group-foraging behaviour termed 'opportunism', whereby many foragers search independently in the field, until one of them finds an exceptional sugar-solution resource and then rapidly recruits nestmates. Overall, workers preferred the 40% sugar feeders, visitation rates decreased with increasing distance from the nest, and visits at the 20 and 10% feeders increased in that sequence when replenishment with sugar solution was interrupted and sugar concentrations declined progressively in the 40 and 20% feeders. These results show that workers have the physiological ability to identify the richest sugar solutions, but indicate that food choice will vary with resource variability.

One hundred and seventy seven species (98% of the total) and ten genera are endemic to the region. Within Western Australia, all members are confined to the south, with a bimodal pattern of species diversity centred on the sandplains and uplands around the Stirling Ranges and Mount Lesueur. Leucopogon, the largest genus, reflects this pattern, however, species diversity is greatest on the south coastal sandplains. All species are woody shrubs, mostly found on neutral or acidic sandy soils. Plants of at least 120 species are killed by fire; Astroloma contains the only significant number of resprouting species. Although some species are in flower every month every year, autumn/winter flowering is a common feature of many members of the family. All species are biotically pollinated. Bird pollination is found in 18 species in six genera. The remaining species are insect pollinated. Bees are the major pollinators in Leucopogon, Conostephium and Coleanthera. Moths and butterflies are important pollinators in Andersonia, Leucopogon, Lysinema and Styphelia. Flies are minor pollinators of some species of Andersonia, Leucopogon and Monotoca. All species studied are protandrous and outbreeding, with only Cosmelia being capable of self pollination. Fruits are fleshy in Astroloma, Brachrloma, Croninia, in certain species of Leucopogon and Styphelia and are animal dispersed. Other genera have dry, dehiscent fruit with gravity or wind dispersed seeds. Many species have relatively narrow distribution ranges, 90 species having ranges of over 300 km, 54 species have ranges of 100-300 km and 37 have ranges of less than 100 km (and there are many undescribed species in this group).

In returning to the starting point of their foraging excursion or to any other point, they could resort to two fundamentally different ways of navigation by using either egocentric or geocentric systems of reference. In the first case, they would rely on information continuously collected en route (path integration, dead reckoning), i.e. integrate all angles steered and all distances covered into a mean home vector. In the second case, they are expected, at least by some authors, to use a map-based system of navigation, i.e. to obtain positional information by virtue of the spatial position they occupy within a larger environmental framework. In bees and ants, path integration employing a skylight compass is the predominant mechanism of navigation, but geocentred landmark-based information is used as well. This information is obtained while the animal is dead-reckoning and, hence, added to the vector course. For example, the image of the horizon skyline surrounding the nest entrance is retinotopically stored while the animal approaches the goal along its vector course. As shown in desert ants (genus Cataglyphis), there is neither interocular nor intraocular transfer of landmark information. Furthermore, this retinotopically fixed, and hence egocentred, neural snapshot is linked to an external (geocentred) system of reference. In this way, geocentred information might more and more complement and potentially even supersede the egocentred information provided by the path-integration system. In competition experiments, however, Cataglyphis never frees itself of its homeward-bound vector - its safety-line, so to speak - by which it is always linked to home. Vector information can also be transferred to a longer-lasting (higher-order) memory. There is no need to invoke the concept of the mental analogue of a topographic map - a metric map - assembled by the insect navigator. The flexible use of vectors, snapshots and landmark-based routes suffices to interpret the insect's behaviour. The cognitive-map approach in particular, and the representational paradigm in general, are discussed.",Article,Scopus

This view is implicit in many discussions of angiosperm evolution and plant-pollinator coevolution and in the long-standing concept of ""pollination syndromes."" But actual pollination systems often are more generalized and dynamic than these traditions might suggest. To illustrate the range of specialization and generalization in pollinators' use of plants and vice versa, we draw on studies of two floras in the United States, and of members of several plant families and solitary bee genera. We also summarize a recent study of one local flora which suggests that, although the colors of flowers are aggregated in ""phenotype space,"" there is no strong association with pollinator types as pollination syndromes would predict. That moderate to substantial generalization often occurs is not surprising on theoretical grounds. Plant generalization is predicted by a simple model as long as temporal and spatial variance in pollinator quality is appreciable, different pollinator species do not fluctuate in unison, and they are similar in their pollination effectiveness. Pollinator generalization is predicted when floral rewards are similar across plant species, travel is costly, constraints of behavior and morphology are minor, and/or pollinator lifespan is long relative to flowering of individual plant species. Recognizing that pollination systems often are generalized has important implications. In ecological predictions of plant reproductive success and population dynamics it is useful to widen the focus beyond flower visitors within the ""correct"" pollination syndrome, and to recognize temporal and spatial fluidity of interactions. Behavioral studies of pollinator foraging choices and information-processing abilities will benefit from understanding the selective advantages of generalization. In studies of floral adaptation, microevolution, and plant speciation one should recognize that selection and gene flow vary in time and space and that the contribution of pollinators to reproductive isolation of plant species may be overstated. In conservation biology, generalized pollination systems imply resilience to linked extinctions, but also the possibility for introduced generalists to displace natives with a net loss of diversity.",Article,Scopus

Iridaceae and Geraniaceae, with intense purple to crimson flowers and extremely long and slender perianth tubes, is pollinated exclusively by two long-tongued flies of the family Nemestrinidae. The two species of flies, Prosoeca peringueyi and P. sp. nov., are active in the late winter and spring, have large bodies, mouthparts 20-50 mm long, and forage for nectar while bovering. Plants pollinated by these two flies share a suite of convergent floral characteristics, including a straight or slightly curved floral tube at least 20 mm and up to 70 mm long, relatively short petals or tepals colored predominantly dark blue- or red-purple with pale nectar guides, and anthers and stigmas exserted from the tube and usually unilateral in orientation. With one exception, the flowers of all species secrete large amounts of nectar of relatively constant total sugar concentration, mostly 24-29%, and high sucrose: hexose ratio. Most members of the guild have odorless flowers. The long floral tube makes nectar unavailable to most insects, including a variety of bees, wasps, and other flies that pollinate plant which co-occur with members of the long-tubed flower guild. The two Prosoeca species have monthparts long enough to forage effectively on these long-tubed flowers, and they are also effective pollinators because pollen adheres to their bodies and is transported from flower to flower. The flies visit a wide range of plants but are effective pollinators only of those with tube lengths greater that their proboscis lengths. We have identified four mutually exclusive sites of pollen deposition on the insects' bodies; when two or more members of the guild co-occur, each species typically utilizes a different pollen deposition site. This suggests that pollen contamination is detrimental to reproductive success. Differential pollen deposition sites may have evolved in response to selection for reduced pollen contamination. Since 27 of the 28 plant species appear to depend exclusively on these two species of Prosoeca for pollination, these flies must be considered keystone species in the ecosystems where they occur.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Queens of Bombus flavifrons, B. kirbyellus and B. mixtus were its major pollinators of a total of 363 individuals of nine Bombus species collected foraging on the plants. The alpine tundra-nesting queens of B. kirbyellus were the commonest pollinators at 2945m and were absent below 2675m. Bombus flavifrons, B. mixtus and B. ternarius spanned the entire transact. Measurement of 229 queen pollinator tongues (glossa-prementum) indicated that mean tongue length increased with elevation but that each station encompassed a broad range of tongue lengths. With the longest tongue, B. kirbyellus foraged nototribically only; B. flavifrons was nototribic only at 2675m but both nototribic and sternotribically collecting pollen elsewhere.

During the stay inside the hive thoracic surface temperature ranged from 31.4 to 43.9 °C. In both round and wagtail dancing honeybees the concentration of sucrose in the food influenced dancing temperature in a non-linear way. Average dancing temperature was 37.9 °C in foragers gathering a 0.5 mol·l-1 sucrose solution, 40.1°C with a 1 mol·l-1, 40.6°C with a 1.5 mol·l-1 and 40.7°C with a 2 mol·l-1 solution.

Thoracic temperatures during trophallactic contact with hive bees were similar to dancing temperature at 1.5 mol·l-1 but lower at the other concentrations. During periods of distribution of food to hive bees (trophallactic contact &gt;2.5s) the dancers' thorax cooled down by more than 0.5°C considerably more frequently with the 0.5 mol·l-1 solution (65% of cases) than with the 1.5 mol·l-1 solution (26%). By contrast, heating the thorax up by more than 0.5°C was infrequent with the 0.5 mol·l-1 solution (2%) but occurred at a maximum rate of 26% with the 1.5 mol·l-1 solution. Bees gathering the 1 or 2 mol·l-1 solutions showed intermediate behavior. Linear model analysis showed that at higher concentrations the dancers compensated better for variations of hive air temperature: per 1 °C increase of hive temperature dancing temperature increased by 0.34, 0.22, 0.12, and 0.13 °C with 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mol·l-1 sucrose solutions, respectively. The results furnish evidence that dancing honeybees follow a strategy of ""selective heterothermy"" by tuning their thermal behavior to the needs of the behavior performed at the moment. Thoracic temperature is regulated to a high level and more accurately when fast exploitation of profitable food sources is recommended. Thoracic temperature is lowered when the ratio of gain to costs of foraging becomes more unfavorable. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

Their nervous systems are relatively small and contain many individually identifiable cells. The CNS is highly compartmentalized with clear separations between multisensory higher order neuropiles in the brain and neuropiles serving sensory-motor routines in the ventral cord (Huber, 1974). The rich behavior of insects includes orientation in space and time, visual, chemical, and mechanical communication, and complex motor routines for flying, walking, swimming, nest building, defense, and attack. Learning and memory, though, are not usually considered to be a strong point of insects. Rather, insect behavior is often regarded as highly stereotyped and under tight control of genetically programmed neural circuits. This view, however, does not do justice to the insect order of Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants). Most Hymenopteran species care for their brood either as individual females or as a social group of females. Consequently, they regularly return to their nest site to feed, protect, and nurse the larvae, store food, and hide from adverse environmental conditions. Since they search for food (prey; nectar and pollen on flowers) at unpredictable sites, they have to learn the celestial and terrestrial cues that guide their foraging trips over long distances and allow them to find their nest sites (central place foraging; von Frisch, 1967; Seeley, 1985). They learn to relate the sun's position and sky pattern of polarized light to the time of the day (Lindauer, 1959), and landmarks are learned in relationship to the nest site within the framework of the time-compensated sun compass. The honeybee communicates direction and distance of a feeding place to hive mates by performing a ritualized body movement, the waggle dance (von Frisch, 1967). Associative learning is an essential component of the bee's central place foraging behavior and dance communication. Hive mates attending a dance performance learn the odor emanating from the dancing bee and seek it at the indicated food site. The odor, color, and shape of flowers are learned when the bee experiences these stimuli shortly before it finds food (nectar, pollen). This appetitive learning in bees has many characteristics of associative learning well known from mammalian learning studies (Menzel, 1985, 1990; Bitterman, 1988). It follows the rules of classical and operant conditioning, respectively, so that stimuli or behavioral acts are associated with evaluating stimuli. Since associative learning, especially of the classical type, is well described at the phenomenological and operational level (Rescorla, 1988), it provides a favorable approach in the search for the neural substrate underlying learning and memory. In particular, associative learning in bees is a fast and robust process. A single associative learning trial, even under conditions when the bee is immobilized for the taking of intracellular recordings from brain neurons, leads to highly significant changes in its behavior and in the response characteristics of identified neurons. Memory induced by a single learning trial lasts for days, and by three learning trials in a free-flying bee, for a lifetime. Here, we shall discuss (1) the role of identified neurons in simpler as well as in more complex forms of learning, (2) the localization of different memory traces and their joint contribution to learned behavior, and (3) the formation of memory in multiple phases.",Review,Scopus

Yet the third dimension, height above ground, may be significant in the tall and dense forest habitats of stingless bees. Foragers of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona postica recruit to a specific three-dimensional location by laying a scent trail. Stingless bees in the genus Melipona are thought to have a more sophisticated recruitment system that communicates distance through sounds inside the nest and direction through pointing zig-zag flights outside the nest. However, prior research on Melipona has not examined height communication or even established that foragers can recruit newcomers to a specific location.

We trained foragers from an observation hive to one feeder and monitored both feeders for the subsequent arrival of newcomers. We changed the relative positions of the feeders to test for correct direction, distance, and canopy-level communication. A 40-m canopy tower located inside the forest enabled us to examine canopy-level communication. We found that M. panamica foragers can recruit to a specific (1) direction, (2) distance, and (3) canopy level. To test the possibility that foragers accomplish this by means of a scent trail, we placed the colony on one shore of a small cove and trained bees over 116 m of open water to a feeder located on the opposite shore. We also placed a second feeder on this shore, equidistant from the colony but 20 m from the first feeder. Significantly more newcomers consistently arrived at the feeder visited by the foragers. Thus foragers evidently do not need a scent trail to communicate direction. Inside the nest, a forager produces pulsed sounds while visibly vibrating her wings after returning from a good food source. She is attended by other bees who cluster and hold their antennae around her, following her as she rapidly spins clockwise and counterclockwise. Locational information may be encoded in this behavior. However, foragers may also directly lead newcomers to the food source. Further experiments are planned to test for such piloting and other communication mechanisms. © 1995, Springer-Verlag. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

All major groups of the freshwater and terrestrial biota had their origin in a relatively restricted part of the earth's surface and, over time, became more widely dispersed. There is no evidence that any species, or larger taxonomic group, came into being simultaneously over a worldwide or large continental area.2. The worldwide patterns of such disparate groups as the birds, mammals, insects, and freshwater fish all conform remarkably well to the regional zoogeographic system devised by P.L. Sclater in 1858 and adopted by Wallace (1876).3. Of all the animal groups that might be used to trace the earth's tectonic history since the mid-Mesozoic, the freshwater fish are probably the most reliable.4. Aside from two catfish families that have become secondarily adapted to saltwater, ostariophysan fish have a purely freshwater history and have not been able to reach such places is Madagascar, Australia, New Zealand, and the West Indies. This permits us to predict that these land masses have not been connected to any larger continent since the Upper Jurassic.5. Some fish groups, now confined to freshwater, had marine ancestors so that their present distributions may have been achieved by oceanic migration. Examples are the lungfish (Ceratodidae), the bonytongues (Osteoglossidae), the Melanotaeniidae, the Percichthyidae, and probably the Nandidae.6. The presence of six archaic fish families that are endemic in Africa, plus the presence of four old families that are also found in South America, gives Africa a remarkably rich fauna of ancient freshwater fish. In comparison, South America is relatively depauperate. This suggests that South America may have originally received its primary freshwater fish from Africa.7. The cypriniform fish (minnows) probably arose in southeast Asia in the early Paleogene. But this group, along with the characoids and catfish, forms a monophyletic triad. This means that all three had a common ancestor somewhere. Catfish have a long evolutionary history in southeast Asia, but the more-primitive characoids now exist only in Africa and South America. Characoid fossils are known from the Eocene and Oligocene of France. Are these fossils remnants of an earlier Eurasian distribution or did the characoids make their way from Africa across the Tethys Sea?8. Another theory says that the three ostariophysan fish groups arose in Gondwana and were transported to Asia when portions of that supercontinent moved northward. But there is nothing in the present or fossil faunas of India and Australia to indicate that this may have happened.9. The North Atlantic connection of the early Eocene permitted the intercontinental migration of the ancient gars and bowfins. The teleost family Percidae probably originated in Europe and invaded North America before the connection was broken.10. Primary freshwater fish began to make their way across Beringia from Asia to North America as early as the late Cretaceous. Paleogene migrations included several archaic fish as well as the more advanced families Hypsidoridae, Ictaluridae, Cyprinidae, and Catostomidae. Some reciprocal crossings have been identified.11. The history of the secondary freshwater fish families Cyprindontidae (killifish) and Cichlidae (cichlids) is of biogeographic interest. Both families are found in Madagascar and the West Indies as well as in Africa and South America. It was suggested that the cichlids probably arose in Africa while the cyprinodontids originally evolved in Central to South America.12. Seven major groups of insects with aquatic larval stages are old, at least early Mesozoic, and their present patterns are often assumed to have been caused by continental dispersement. These are the stoneflies (Plecoptera), caddisflies (Trichoptera), mayflies (Ephemeroptera), blackflies (Simuliidae), midges (Chironomidae), net-winged midges (Blephariceridae), and dragonflies (Petaluridae). All of these groups have antitropical tendencies and relict families and/or genera with amphinotic distributions. The adult stages are generally capable of flight.13. In the southern hemisphere, many groups exhibit amphinotic patterns. Southern South America is invariably included and usually Australia and New Zealand. Less often, the pattern extends to southern Africa, Madagascar, or New Caledonia. The amphinotic groups usually represent the most primitive (plesiomorphic) genera or families within their respective larger groups. Their more advanced (apomorphic) relatives are located to the north, either in the tropics or more commonly at boreal latitudes.14. Many of the amphinotic freshwater groups have been used as examples to illustrate vicariance caused by the rifting of Gondwana. Even though most of the groups considered seem to be sufficiently old, was continental movement the primary reason for the present patterns? Prior to the mid-Miocene, before Antarctica was completely glaciated, the southern land masses were closer together and migration across modest oceanic gaps must have been relatively easy.15. Among the terrestrial insects, the beetles (Coleoptera) are a very old group with a fossil record extending back to the Lower Permian. The most archaic survivor is the Australian genus Omma. Fossil relatives have been described from the Lower Jurassic of England.16. The beetle family Carabidae has been said to illustrate a world-wide pattern of the evolution of dominant groups in Africa and tropical Asia and dispersal into smaller areas, with replacement of older by more recently dominant groups. In such old families, both dispersal and vicariance are important.17. The concept of repetitive “taxon pulses” was developed from work on carabid beetles. Taxa arise in equatorial latitudes and are driven along pathways in three directions: towards the poles, up mountains, and into the forest canopy. Various groups of carabids have repeatedly followed these paths.18. Work with ants indicates that, since mid-Tertiary times, evolution of world-dominating new taxa has proceeded mainly from the combined tropics of Africa and southeast Asia. Older taxa are forced to retreat before the new forms and can shift only from larger to smaller land masses.19. The dipterid family Drosophilidae probably also arose in the Old World tropics, became acclimated to temperate conditions, and crossed to the New World via Beringia. Further dispersal reached South America and, from there, a reverse migration reached North America.20. Other major insect groups also have their greatest diversity in the Old World tropics and may have originated there. Examples are the wasp family Vespidae (southeast Asia), the mosquitos (southeast Asia), the earwigs (southeast Asia), and the moth family Sphingidae (Old World). Others are most diverse in the Neotropical Region and may have arisen there: the bees, robber flies (Asilidae), the hemipterid tribe Myodochini, and flat bugs (Aradidae).21. Many of the large insect groups, that probably originated in the tropics, are now represented by primitive taxa at higher latitudes. The oldest elements tend to occur as isolated relicts in the southern hemisphere. Fossil relatives are sometimes found in the northern temperate zone. The same worldwide pattern is reflected by the spiders and possibly the scorpions.22. In regard to bird distribution, it is important to note that the biogeographic regions differ in the diversity of their avian faunas. The richest by far is the Neotropical Region with 86 families (31 endemic) and 2780 species. The Ethiopian has 73 families (6 endemic) and 1556 species, the Palearctic has 69 families (1 endemic) and 1026 species, the Nearctic has 62 families (1 endemic) and 750 species, the Oriental has 66 families (1 endemic) and 961 species, and the Australian has 64 families (13 endemic) and 906 species.23. The Neotropical bird fauna is comprised, to a large extent, of primitive families. Its diversity has been increased, probably since the creation of the isthmian link, by immigration from North America. The southward invasion may have involved about 10 families. Two Neotropical families evidently dispersed to North America.24. The Palearctic Region encompasses the largest geographic area. The relationship of its bird fauna with that of the Nearctic is especially close. The Palearctic shares 48 of its families, 35% of its genera, and 12.5% of its species with the Nearctic.25. The Oriental and Ethiopian bird faunas are closely related but the Australian is considerably more independent. There is a surprising lack of relationship between the Neotropical and Ethiopian regions.26. The bird tribe Corvida (crows, ravens, magpies, etc.) probably originated in Australia. The same is probably true of the parrots and pigeons; their diversity and that of related families is greatest in the southern hemisphere, particularly the Australian Region. A Gondwana history for the latter two has been suggested, but neither family appears to be that old.27. A Gondwana origin has been assumed for the flightless ratite birds, but they evidently originated in the northern hemisphere in the early Tertiary. They are southern hemisphere relicts of a once widely distributed northern group. The penguins, on the other hand, probably originated in the circum-Antarctic area where they are found today.28. In the Order Galliformes, the Megapodiidae of Australia and the Cracidae of South America are considered to be the most primitive taxa. The worldwide galliform pattern of high diversity, with the more advanced genera and species in the Oriental Region, suggests an origin in that area with a dispersal to the New World via Beringia. The alternative of a Gondwana origin has been proposed, but this bird group is probably not pre-Tertiary.29. The most advanced and successful of all the major bird groups are the oscine passeriforms (songbirds). They dominate the avian fauna of the Palearctic, Nearctic, Oriental, and Ethiopian regions. Most of their evolutionary development probably took place in the Old World tropics, and the New World has received most of its songbird fauna from the Old World. Over the world as a whole, the suboscines are probably being replaced by the oscines.30. Among the mammals, the present faunal complex of the Nearctic Regions reflects a strong Palearctic influence which began in the late Cretaceous and continued through most of the Tertiary. Modern North American rodents, sheep, goats, beavers, rabbits, cats, bears, deer, elk, reindeer, and wolves have all evolved from ancestral species that came across the Bering Land Bridge. The sabre-tooth cat, mammoths, and mastodons also invaded from Asia but became extinct in the Pleistocene.31. Although the Palearctic, with its larger area and greater mammalian diversity, exported more genera than it received, there were reciprocal migrations. From the Nearctic, it received camels, tapirs, and five horse genera. Following the connection to Africa in the early Miocene, Asia was invaded by a variety of proboscidean, bovid, and other genera. Other forms migrated northward from the Oriental Region.32. Prior to the Oligocene, Europe was still separated from Asia so that a continuous Palearctic fauna did not exist. In the early Eocene, Europe was invaded by a large number of North American mammals by way of the North Atlantic connection. With the retreat of the Turgai Sea in the Oligocene, Europe was invaded from Asia, so that its modern mammalian fauna has been derived from two main sources.33. The Oriental Region shares most of its mammalian families with the Ethiopian. This mixture began with the early Miocene connection of Africa and Asia through the Arabian Peninsula. The peculiar mammalian fauna of Madagascar was derived from Africa by means of waif dispersal across an oceanic barrier.34. Primitive mammalian stocks may have been introduced to Africa by an occasional connection in the Paleocene. From that time until the early Miocene, the Ethiopian fauna developed in isolation. Among the many endemic families were the higher primates and humans.35. By the early Cretaceous, South America was separated from Africa and, by the late Cretaceous-Paleocene, the peninsular connection to North America was broken. Prior to its 60 Ma of isolation, South America had probably received from North America primitive marsupial, edentate, and ungulate mammals. Playrrhine monkeys and caviomorph rodents may have reached South America by migrating along the Central American island chain in the early Tertiary.36. The completion of the isthmian connection about 3 Ma ago resulted in a significant mammalian interchange between the Americas. Nearly half the families and genera now on the South American continent belong to groups that have emigrated from North America during the past 3 Ma.37. Australia apparently became separated from the rest of Gondwana in the Jurassic. The isolation of Australia ended, to some degree, in the Paleocene-Eocene when a filter route from South America via Antarctica became available. This permitted a limited dispersal to Australia which involved the marsupials but none of the other mammalian groups except a primitive condylarth. Before their arrival, Australia was occupied by only one other land-mammal group, the egg-laying monotremes. Placental rodents apparently arrived from Asia in the early Pliocene.38. Evolution of the modern amphibians had evidently gotten underway by the time Pangaea had become essentially separated into its northern (Laurasian) and southern (Gondwanian) parts. The history of the salamanders has been entirely Laurasian and that of the caecilians almost entirely Gondwanian. The Asian families of caecilians may have been transported there by the Indian plate.39. The early evolutionary history of the frogs may have been Gondwanian, although no primitive frogs or fossils have been found in Australia. The archaic living frog genera in North America and New Zealand are likely to have come from South America-Africa in the Lower Jurassic or even before that.40. Considerable frog evolution took place in South America-Africa before those two continents split apart. Subsequently, frog genera dispersed to North America in the late Cretaceous to early Paleocene and across to Asia via Beringia. Some were transported to Asia by India and others migrated to Asia via the Arabian Peninsula. They probably first reached Australia from South America by means of the Eocene filter route. Despite their aversion to saltwater, frogs have been able to cross many minor oceanic barriers.41. The Upper Triassic to Cretaceous sphenodonts were once widely distributed but now survive only as a single species on small islands off New Zealand. Their relatives, the true lizards, apparently underwent a dichotomy when Laurasia and Gondwana began to separate. The separation produced a southern iguanian group and a northern group ancestral to all other lizards.42. The most primitive true lizards belong to the family Iguanidae. The iguanids are presently found in the New World, Madagascar, and the Fiji and Tonga Islands. Their extinction in Africa may have been caused by competition from more advanced lizards. Many advanced lizard families evolved in Laurasia and some spread into parts of the southern hemisphere.43. Snakes probably arose in Gondwana, most likely in the South American-African region. Two primitive groups reached North America from South America in the late Cretaceous. The archaic family Boidae includes the boas and pythons. The boas are found in the New World, Madagascar, and three isolated localities in Polynesia. The pythons have a complimentary distribution occurring in the Ethiopian, Oriental, and Australian regions. The pythons may have outcompeted the boas so that the latter, like the iguanid lizards, now have a disjunct distribution.44. The more advanced snake families are typical of the Old World tropics with one family (Elapidae) being numerous in Australia and along the west Pacific rim. The poisonous elapids and viperids (Viperidae) have entered the New World via Beringia.45. The most primitive living turtles belong to the group called the side-necked turtles (Pleurodira). There are two families, one in South America-Africa-Madagascar and the other in South America and Australia. The more advanced turtles (Cryptodira) are found mainly on the northern continents. Most of the living genera belong to the family Testudinidae which is most diverse in the Oriental Region.46. Terrestrial plants are usually divided into a series of kingdoms, subkingdoms, regions, and provinces. In general, the kingdoms and subkingdoms are somewhat similar to the regions recognized by zoogeographers.47. The liverworts (hepatophytes) are among the most simple of the land plants. Although they are widely distributed in mesic habitats, they are represented by many primitive, endemic genera in the Antipodes area (New Zealand, Tasmania, southeastern Australia, New Caledonia). Other genera have disjunct distributions in the north temperate zone.48. The pteridophytes tend to be very widespread, but some genera have distributions that have been attributed to a Gondwana origin. There is a curious lack of fern diversity in Africa compared to the Neotropics and southeast Asia.49. Among the gymnosperms, the archaic family Ginkgoaceae was widespread in the Mesozoic but now there is only a single species which is native to eastern China. Another old family, the Araucariaceae, was once broadly distributed in both hemispheres, but now has a relict distribution, primarily in the southern hemisphere. The Cupressaceae are currently widespread in both hemispheres. Three small conifer families have restricted distributions in the far east.50. The family Pinaceae is almost entirely northern hemisphere. Most genera are widespread, but three are restricted to east Asia and one is endemic to North America. The Podocarpaceae is the most diverse southern hemisphere conifer family. Most of the genera are located in the area from southeast Asia to Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, and Fiji.51. The Taxaceae has one widespread northern genus, another with isolated species in North America and east Asia, a third that is confined to east central China, and a fourth that is endemic to New Caledonia.52. The Taxodiaceae, once widespread in the northern hemisphere, is now reduced to a series of discontinuous relicts. Three genera exist in North America, five in east Asia, and one in Tasmania.53. The cycads have four living families. Three of them have limited ranges in the southern hemisphere while one (Zamiaceae) is widespread in the Americas as well as Africa and Australia.54. The most primitive orders and families of the flowering plants are isolated on the periphery of southeast Asia. They extend from Australia and New Guinea out to New Caledonia, Fiji, and a few westward to Madagascar and South America. Many are also found in the mountains of east Asia.55. There are two popular theories about the center of origin of the angiosperms. One of them argues for western Gondwana (South America-Africa) and the other for the general southeast Asian area. The peripheral pattern of most of the primitive orders and families appears to favor the latter.56. As the early angiosperms evolved in the tropics of southeast Asia, they expanded in all directions. During the global warming of the Eocene, many angiosperm families dispersed across Beringia and spread across North America. Some of them reached Europe before the North Atlantic connection was broken in the early Eocene. The evidence for this major migration lies in the close relationships between the modern floras of east Asia and eastern North America.57. The Neotropical Kingdom is a distinctive floral region with 47 endemic families and almost 3000 endemic genera. A barrier to plant dispersal between South America and Africa has probably existed since the early Cretaceous.58. The Paleotropical Kingdom includes all of the Old World tropics and is divided into five subkingdoms. While some 60 families have pantropical distributions, only 12 are shared exclusively between Africa and South America. The Cape region of South Africa is placed in a kingdom of its own.59. The Malesian Region, which includes the southern part of the Malay Peninsula, north to the Philippines and Taiwan, and east to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, possesses an extremely rich flora of more than 25 000 species. It is also characterized by large numbers of archaic angiosperms.60. The Australian Kingdom contains 18 endemic families and 550 endemic genera. Some Australian families of angiosperms and conifers reached South America via Antarctica, probably in the Eocene. Between 50 and 60 genera, or distinctive parts of more-widespread genera, occur principally in Australasia and South America, about half of them in New Zealand alone.61. The Holantarctic Kingdom includes all of the temperate southern hemisphere except southern Australia and Tasmania. The New Zealand flora is most closely related to that of Australia, but about 40% of its fern genera and about 43% of its seed-plant genera are shared with Chile.62. The small island of New Caledonia has seven endemic families and more than 130 endemic genera. The archaic angiosperm genera include six of the twelve known taxa that lack vessels in their woody stems. © 1995, Elsevier B.V.",Note,Scopus

We simultaneously sampled recruitment dances of bees inside observation hives in two colonies over 4 days in Miami, Florida (1989) and from two other colonies over five days in Riverside, California (1991). Information encoded in the dance was used to determine the distance and direction that bees flew from the hive for pollen and nectar and to construct foraging maps for each colony. The foraging maps showed that bees from the two colonies in each location usually foraged at different sites, but occasionally they visited the same patches of flowers. Each colony shifted foraging effort among sites on different days. In both locations, the mean flight distances differed between colonies and among days within colonies.

Honeybees Apis mellifera ligustica were trained to work on a patch with artificial rewarding and non-rewarding flowers, coupled to an air extractor. The perceptual colour distance between the rewarding and the non-rewarding flowers was varied and the flower choice and the repellent scent-marking behaviour of the bees were recorded. 2. The discrimination between rewarding and non-rewarding flowers depended on their colour distance, improving with a greater colour difference. This task was guided thus visually and was not affected by activating the air extractor. 3. The scent-marking activity was only observable when the colour information of both groups of flowers was the same or very similar. This thus represents the first reported case of a modulation of an olfactory activity through the visual input provided by colour distances. When the air extractor was activated, rejections associated with the scent-marking behaviour disappeared, thus confirming the olfactory nature of this behaviour. 4. Honeybees are thus capable of using one or more sensory cues to enhance their foraging efficiency, according to the environmental situation. This great plasticity allows them to attain an enhanced efficiency while foraging. 5. We successfully applied the model of colour choice behaviour of the honeybee. Since the original theory was developed for Apis mellifera carnica, this work also constitutes the first attempt to describe the behaviour of the honeybee race, Apis mellifera ligustica, using the postulated model, and reaffirms thus its generality. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

This representation contains among other features cues to the distance of near-by landmarks. We worked with two species of ground-nesting bees, Lasioglossum malachurum (Hymenoptera: Halictidae), Dasypoda hirtipes (Hymenoptera: Melittidae) and asked which cues to landmark distance they use during homing. Bees learned to associate a single cylindrical landmark with their nest's location. We subsequently tested returning bees with landmarks of different sizes and thus introduced large discrepancies between the angular size of the landmark as seen from the nest during training and its distance from the nest. The bees' search behaviour and their choice of dummy nest entrances show that both species of ground-nesting bees consistently search for their nest at the learned distance from landmarks. The influence of the apparent size of landmarks on the bees' search and choice behaviour is comparatively weak. We suggest that the bees exploit cues derived from the apparent speed of the landmark's image at their retina for distance evaluation. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

They learn about landmarks both when approaching and when leaving the site. Whereas learning on arrival can take place on every visit to the food source, learning on departure is limited to the first few visits, when the bee Turns Back and Looks (TBL) at the feeder in a stereotyped manoeuvre before flying off. We investigated whether one specific function of TBLs is to acquire information about the absolute distance of landmarks from the feeding site. Bees were trained to forage from a feeder which lay at a fixed distance from a cylinder. During training, bees were exposed to the cylinder either only while they approached and landed on the feeder, or only on their departure from it, or at both of these times. Tests on trained bees immediately after the TBL phase revealed that those bees which had viewed the cylinder only on arrival had learnt the apparent size of the cylinder, but not its distance from the feeder. In contrast, bees which saw the cylinder on departure had learnt its absolute distance. They also learnt the cylinder's apparent size, provided that the cylinder was close to the feeder. Bees which had viewed the cylinder on arrival as well as on departure learnt both absolute distance and apparent size. Distance dominated the bees' behaviour in the initial phase of learning, apparent size was more important later on. We suggest that early during learning bees need information about the 3-D structure of the environment so that they can identify those landmarks close to a foraging site which will specify accurately the site's position. This information is acquired during TBLs. Later, landmark guidance can be achieved by 2-D image matching. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

Prior to absconding, waggle dances regularly communicated distances up to 10-20 km from the nests. However, compared to waggle dances observed during nonabsconding periods, those occurring prior to migration were less associated with food sources, occurred during periods of little or no flight activity, and exhibited great variability in the communication of distance by consecutive waggle runs of individual bees. It is therefore unlikely that ""migration dances"" communicated the locations of, or stimulated immediate recruitment for, specific foraging or nesting sites. Rather, the dances may have functioned to establish a general route of travel. The majority of migration dances observed were oriented in an easterly direction, and upon departure both colonies traveled towards the E-SE. The orientation of migration dances occurred independently of the directions communicated by waggle dances associated with past foraging success or the sampling of alternate foraging areas. Migration dance orientation may have been affected by prevailing wind directions, because during the migration period winds blew primarily from the east. However, it is unlikely that wind direction was the only factor influencing migration dance orientation. The lack of immediate flight activity associated with migration dance performance suggests the dances may have gradually prepared colonies for migratory movement by conveying a message to fly for a long, but unspecified distance in a certain direction. Waggle dances associated with migration may therefore function differently from those associated with foraging and nest site selection, which convey both the distance and direction to specific locations. © 1994 Birkhäuser Verlag.",Article,Scopus

Initial observations showed that not all of the bees that appear to be dance followers behave the same. Some bees maneuver themselves behind the dancer, while others do not. The paths of a single dancer, trained to an artificial food source, and her followers were traced during the waggle runs. The success of these dance followers was compared to their position relative to the dancer.

They transmit this information to colony members by means of waggle dances. To investigate the way bees transduce the stimulus of nectar-source profitability into the response of number of waggle runs, I performed experiments in which bees were stimulated with a sucrose solution feeder of known profitability and their dance responses were videorecorded. The results suggest that several attributes of this transduction process are adaptations to enhance a bee's effectiveness in reporting on a forage site. (1) Bees register the profitability of a nectar source not by sensing the energy gain per foraging trip or the rate of energy gain per trip, but evidently by sensing the energetic efficiency of their foraging. Perhaps this criterion of nectar-source profitability has been favored by natural selection because the foraging gains of honey bees are typically limited by energy expenditure rather than time availability. (2) There is a linear relationship between the stimulus of energetic efficiency of foraging and the response of number of waggle runs per dance. Such a simple stimulus-response function appears adequate because the range of suprathreshold stimuli (max/min ratio of about 10) is far smaller than the range of responses (max/min ratio of about 100). Although all bees show a linear stimulus-response function, there are large differences among individuals in both the response threshold and the slope of the stimulus-response function. This variation gives the colony a broader dynamic range in responding to food sources than if all bees had identical thresholds of dance response. (3) There is little or no adaptation in the dance response to a strong stimulus (tonic response). Thus each dancing bee reports on the current level of profitability of her forage site rather than the changes in its profitability. This seems appropriate since presumably it is the current profitability of a forage site, not the change in its profitability, which determines a site's attractiveness to other bees. (4) The level of forage-site quality that is the threshold for dancing is tuned by the bees in relation to forage availability. Bees operate with a lower dance threshold when forage is sparse than when it is abundant. Thus a colony utilizes input about a wide range of forage sites when food is scarce, but filters out input about low-reward sites when food is plentiful. (5) A dancing bee does not present her information in one spot within the hive but instead distributes it over much of the dance floor. Consequently, the dances for different forage sites are mixed together on the dance floor. This helps each bee following the dances to take a random sample of the dance information, which is appropriate for the foraging strategy of a honey bee colony since it is evidently designed to allocate foragers among forage sites in proportion to their profitability. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

This hypothesis was tested using a paradigm, in which forager bees were temporarily made to fly stationarily in a wind tunnel on their way to and from the feeding site, so that information about the way to the feeding site, but not the information about the location of the food source, was experimentally influenced.

The behaviour and activity patterns of Apis mellifera and of five species of Bombus were analysed in relation to climatic variables and nectar quality on three varieties of unsprayed cultivated raspberry (Rubus idaeus) in eastern Scotland. Stages of floral morphology and reward were similar for the three varieties: young flowers offered both nectar and pollen, but medium and old flowers offered nectar only, in diminishing quantities. A wide range of insects visited raspberry flowers, but bees were dominant, bumblebees being responsible for about 60% of all visits and honeybees making up most of the remaining percentage. All bees had substantial pollen deposited on their bodies during visits, though few specifically collected it. Bombus spp. were found to favour young (receptive) flowers strongly, especially early in the morning when pollen was most abundant: whilst Apis visited unselectively. Bumblebees also foraged over substantially longer periods of the day, and in poorer weather, some being present at most times of observation; and they foraged more quickly in terms of flower visits per minute. Bombus carried more pollen on their bodies than Apis, and also deposited more pollen on raspberry stigmas, with B.lapidarius and B.terrestris being particularly effective and also being the most abundant species. All bumblebees also foraged over a longer range, moving between canes and rows more frequently than did honeybees. Bumblebees are therefore likely to be substantially more important as pollinators of raspberries than are honeybees, especially as raspberries though moderately self‐fertile may exhibit metaxenia. Reasons why Bombus may be the preferred pollinator in most sites of raspberry cultivation are discussed, together with implications for present and future growers. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

In some species, the almost exclusive presence of pollen grains belonging to the Leguminosae family in the pollen contents of nest cells, opens a new pathway for the understanding of the relationship between insect and type of culture (insect diet). The presence of a particular pollen, while carrier of valuable information about the local flora looked for by wild bees, is an indicator of the food source.

Early‐blooming plants had a high queen/worker pollinator ratio, while workers predominated on later‐blooming plants. No altitudinal difference in distribution of Bombus species occurred. Analysis of 955 corbicular pollen loads from 1158 bumblebees collected yielded 49.5% monolecty for queens and 34.5% for workers with a wider range for queens than for workers.

A 1 m circle of non-transgenic plants was sown in the centre of the transgenic area to allow estimation of the level of pollen dispersal when plants were in close contact. Honeybee hives were placed at the trial site to optimize the opportunity for cross-pollination. During the flowering period, regular observations were made of the number of plants flowering and the number and type of insects present in 60 1 m2 areas. These areas were located uniformly around the plot at distances of 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 47 m from the edge of the 9 m circle of transgenic plants.

To help understand how honeybees might acquire such routes, we examined whether (1) bees learn motor sequences, (2) they link motor instructions to visual stimuli, (3) their visual memories are triggered by contextual cues associated with the bees' position in a sequence. 1. Bees were trained to follow a complex route through a series of obstacles inside a large, 250 cm by 250 cm box. In tests, the obstacles were briefly removed and the bees continued to fly the same zig-zag trajectory that they had when the obstacles were present. The bees' complex trajectory could reflect either the performance of a sequence of motor instructions or their attempt to reach fixed points in their environment. When the point of entry to the box was shifted, the bees' trajectory with respect to the new point of entry was relatively unchanged, suggesting that bees have learnt a motor sequence. 2. Bees were trained along an obstacle course in which different flight directions were associated with the presence of different large patches of colour. In tests, the order of coloured patches was reversed, the trajectory followed by the bees was determined by the order of colours rather than by the learnt motor sequence suggesting that bees will readily link the performance of a particular trajectory to an arbitrary visual stimulus. 3. Bees flew through a series of 3 similar compartments to reach a food reward. Passage from one compartment to the next was only possible through the centre of one of a pair of patterns, e.g. white + ve vs. black - ve in the first box, blue + ve vs. yellow -ve in the second, vertical + ve vs. horizontal - ve in the last. In some tests, bees were presented with a white vs. a vertical stimulus in the front compartment, while, in other tests, the same pair of stimuli was presented in the rear compartment. Bees preferred the white stimulus when tested in the first compartment, but chose the vertical stimulus in the last compartment. Bees reaching a compartment are thus primed to recall the stimulus which they normally encounter there. We argue that the elements which are linked together to form a route are ""path-segments"", each of which takes a bee for a given distance in a given direction. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

A single visit to a flower as sufficient to affect the flight distance to the next flower. However, longer sequences of two or three visits had an additional effect on the subsequent flight distance of individual foragers. This suggests that bumble bees can integrate information from at least three flowers for making a subsequent foraging decision.

Colony foraging ranges and sites visited increased slightly during the dearth period, yet foraging continued to be concentrated within less than 10 km2. The degree to which fluctuations in foraging patterns were correlated with colony energy status varied with the availability of floral resources.

Experiments with artificial swarms demonstrated similar reorientation by bees and further showed that the experience of being in a swarm triggers patterns of behaviour apparently used in reorientation. In addition, bees remembered information about the natal nest even after they moved to a new nest: Reoriented bees from artificial swarms deprived of their new hive returned to their natal hive rather than to another equidistantly located hive.

In different experimental combinations of reward rates, color marks, odors and distances of the feeders, the behavior of the test bee was monitored by a computer in real time by several devices installed in each feeder. The test bee optimizes by partially matching its choice behavior to the reward rates of the feeders. The matching behavior differs strongly between ""stay"" flights (the bee chooses the feeder just visited) and ""shift"" flights (the bee chooses one of the three alternative feeders). The probability of stay and shift flights depends on the reward sequence and on the time interval between successive visits. Since functions describing the rising probability of stay flights with rising amounts of sucrose solution just experienced differ for the four feeders, it is concluded that bees develop feeder-specific memories. The choice profiles of shift flights between the three alternative feeders depend on the mean reward rate of the feeder last visited. Good matching is found after visits to the low-reward feeders and poor matching following departure from the high-reward feeders. These results indicate that bees use two different kinds of memories to guide their choice behavior: a transient short-term working memory that is not feeder-specific, and a feeder-specific long-term reference memory. Model calculations were carried out to test this hypothesis. The model was based on a learning rule (the difference rule) developed by Rescorla and Wagner (1972), which was extended to the two forms of memories to predict this operant behavior. The experiments show that a foraging honeybee learns the properties of a food source (its signals and rewards) so effectively that specific expectations guide the choice behavior. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

It is also known that they acquire this representation during an orientation flight performed on departure. A detailed film analysis shows that orientation flights in solitary wasps of the genus Cerceris consist of a systematic behavioural sequence: after lift-off from the nest entrance, wasps fly in ever increasing arcs around the nest. They fly along these arcs obliquely to their long axis and turn so that the nest entrance is held in the left or right visual field at retinal positions between 30° and 70° from the midline. Horizontal distance from the nest and height above ground increase throughout an orientation flight so that the nest is kept at retinal elevations between 45° and 60° below the horizon. The wasps' rate of turning is constant at between 100°/s and 200°/s independent of their distance from the nest and their ground velocity increases with distance. The consequence of this is that throughout the flight wasps circle at a constant angular velocity around the nest. Orientation flights are strongly influenced by landmark lay-out. Wasps adjust their flight-path and their orientation in a way that allows them to fixate the nest entrance and to hold the closest landmark in their frontal visual field. The orientation flight generates a specific topography of motion parallax across the visual field. This could be used by wasps to acquire a series of snapshots that all contain the nest position, to acquire snapshots of close landmarks only (distance filtering), to exclude shadow contours from their visual representation (figure-ground discrimination) or to gain information on the distance of landmarks relative to the nest. © 1993, Springer-Verlag.

Small, unspecialized pollinators may be among the factors responsible for gender separation in this habitat. The underlying assumption is that poor fliers and/or communal foragers frequently effect selfing which in turn, given sufficiently severe inbreeding depression, should favor the establishment of dioecy. At least 10% of the genera of the angiosperms includes dioecious species; in tropical flowering plants, however, pollinators are reliably known only in a few species. Whereas temperate dioecious species commonly are wind- or water-pollinated, anemophily is less important in tropical forests, but occurs in at least 30 dioecious genera. Survey of tropical dioecious zoophilous species in 29 genera (21 families) for which pollination information is available shows that these species have specialized flowers adapted to specific pollinators rather than generalized flowers suitable for diverse insects. Known pollinators include solitary and eusocial bees, beetles, moths, flies, wasps (including fig wasps), and rarely bats and birds, and cover a wide range in animal size and locomotive capabilities. Floral rewards comprise pollen, nectar, stylar mucilage, nutritious tissues, brood-places, and resins. About a third of the species offer no reward in the female morph, pollination by deceit apparently being common.

Two of the colonies (colonies 1 & 2) migrated during the study period, while the remaining two (colonies 3 & 4) did not. During the 4-6 weeks preceding the onset of migration preparations, colonies 1 & 2 exhibited increasing population sizes, high levels of brood production with low brood mortality, relatively large stores of food, and increasing mass. In contrast, the populations of colonies 3 & 4 did not increase, brood-rearing activity was erratic and lower, brood mortality was higher, food stores became depleted and colony mass declined. Both colonies 3 & 4 ceased rearing brood, and colony 3 died of starvation. Colony foraging activity was examined by monitoring waggle-dance activity 2-3 days each week. For 4-6 weeks before the onset of migration in colonies 1 & 2, daily foraging areas and mean daily foraging distances became increasingly large and variable. Colonies 3 & 4 exhibited foraging patterns similar to those observed for colonies 1 & 2 preceding migration. There was no clear association between 7 weather parameters examined and migration behavior. These data suggest that migration is influenced by an interaction of intra-colony demographics, food reserves and foraging patterns. Migration may be feasible only for those colonies that possess (1) a population of appropriate size and age structure to compensate for the natural attrition of older workers during the emigration process, and (2) sufficient food reserves for long-distance travel and the establishment of a new nest. Changing foraging patterns may reflect a deteriorating foraging environment, which may trigger the onset of migration preparations, provided that colony demographics and food reserves are conducive. Colonies that show decreased brood production, higher brood mortality and reduced food stores may be incapable of migrating, even when experiencing deteriorating foraging conditions. Rather, such colonies may have a greater chance of survival if they attempt to persist in a given area. © 1992 Birkhäuser Verlag.",Article,Scopus

The probability of departure from individual plants was negatively related to the amount of reward received at the two lastvisited flowers.

Direct calorimetric results of this paper are compared with data of indirect calorimetry from the literature using a respiratory quotient of 1.00 and 21.13 J consumed. Agreements between both methods are generally good. The results show that weight-specific heat production rates increase with age of worker bees by a factor of 5.6 at 30 °C, 3.7 at 25 °C and 40.0 at 20 °C. In groups of foragers the heat production decreases with growing group size to around 6% of the value for an isolated bee. The presence of a fertile queen or of brood reduces the heat output of a small worker group significantly. Adult drones exhibit a much higher metabolic rate (up to 19.7-fold at 20 °C) than juveniles with strong fluctuations in the power-time curves. Fertile queens show a less pronounced heat production rate than virgin queens (54% at 30 °C, 87% at 25 °C and 77% at 20 °C). Calorimetric unrest is much higher for young than for adult queens. Heat production is very low in both uncapped and capped brood and less than 30% of that of a newly emerged worker. In most cases temperature showed a significant influence on the metabolic level, although its sign was not homogeneous between the castes or even within them.

The estimated pollen pools in the six local populations were homogeneous, and there was no evidence of deviation from random mating in any of the local populations. The genotypic distributions were homogeneous in the local populations and accorded with Hardy-Weinberg proportions. There was no evidence of selection at the studied locus, accordingly, the studied population was panmictic and its genotypic distribution could be described with a single parameter, the allele frequency at the marker locus. © The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Article,Scopus

A single brood of workers is produced in the northern region; two broods are common in C Europe and S Spain; up to three broods occur in some parts of the Mediterranean area. Nests in the first phase contain 3-12 cells, arranged in a comb and surrounded by a cavity. Nests of later phases are deeper with increasing numbers of cells. The caste system is based on conspicuous morphometric and physiological differences. Gynes are reared on big pollen balls, and required a diapause before nest foundation in spring. Queens lay virtually all diploid eggs for worker and gyne production. Workers are raised on small provisions, lack a diapause, but commence activities immediately after emergence. Their main tasks include foraging, defence and construction. Males acount for only 2% of the first brood, but their numbers increase throughout the summer. Populations of nests in the last phase can range from a handful to close to 90 bees. Productivity is commensurate, exending from a low of half a dozen gynes to more than several hundred sexuals. Fecundity of this magnitude explains the colonising efficacy of the species, both with regards to newly created nest sites and old aggregations recently devastated by the depredations of brood parasites. -from Author",Article,Scopus

Results of a 5-yr study that was focused on this subject are summarized as follows. Two studies involved moving individual nest blocks various distances within orchards, two additional experiments tested the possibility of moving bees nesting in small nest shelters greater distances during active nesting periods, and one study tested transport of bees nesting in large nest shelters constructed on flat-bed trailers. All of the transported bees in the first four experiments abandoned established nests immediately after they were moved, and none of these bees reestablished nesting within the confines of experimental plots.

A review of evidence from a colony perspective reveals that colony members range an average distance from their home base, whether while foraging on food sources, while collecting water, or while relocating as swarms. Those averages, based on the logarithm of the distance from the colony, vary with the type of resource exploited and size of the odor field.

Video recordings and macrophotography were used to view an area of the dance field. Two distinct behaviours were recognized: that of followers and that of attendants. The attendants stood around the dance field with their antennae stretched towards the dancer, and only occasionally moved with the dancer. Followers continuously ran with the dancer, keeping their heads within the border of the dancer’s figure-eight path at all times. The angle between the body of the follower and that of the dancer was 90° during most of the dance, except at the exit of the waggle run. At that time the follower had to cross over to the opposite side of the dancer. The distance between the head of the follower and the dancer’s body was nearly always smaller (1 758 cases out of a total of 1 882) than the length of an extended antenna. During the return run the follower touched the dancer with antennae most of the time, whereas during the waggle run the followers intermittently touched the dancer. Either one bee (81 % of cases) or two bees (18%) followed the dance simultaneously.

To investigate the basis of this “centering response, ” bees were trained to fly through a tunnel on their way to a feeding site and back, while their flight trajectories were filmed from above. The wall on either side carried a visual pattern. When the patterns were stationary vertical gratings, bees tended to fly through the middle of the tunnel, i.e. along its longitudinal axis. However, when one of the gratings was in motion, bees flying in the same direction as the moving grating tended to fly closer to it, while bees flying in the opposite direction tended to fly closer to the stationary grating. This demonstrates, directly and unequivocally, that flying bees estimate the distances of surfaces in terms of the apparent motion of their images. A series of further experiments revealed that the distance to the gratings is gauged in terms of their apparent angular speeds, and that the visual system of the bee is capable of measuring angular speed largely independently of the spatial period, intensity profile, or contrast of the grating. Thus, the motion-sensitive mechanisms mediating range perception appear to be qualitatively different from those that mediate the well-known optomotor response in insects, or those involved in motion detection and ocular tracking in man. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

Training experiments were carried out with several groups of bees, using various colors for the target and the background. Computer-aided frame-by-frame analysis of video recordings was used to plot the instantaneous positions of the target, as well as the position and orientation of the approaching bee in three dimensions. The results show that bees are perfectly capable of tracking moving targets and landing on them. When the distance of the target is greater than 15 cm, approaching bees correct for angular deviations of the target from the midline, both in the horizontal and in the vertical plane. In either plane, the input variables that are important to the tracking system seem to be (1) the angular bearing of the target with respect to the midline, and (2) the angular velocity of the target with respect to the eye. The tracking control system tends to orient the bee such that the target is located frontally, at an angle of ca. 35 deg below the bee’s long axis. The chromatic properties of tracking behavior were investigated by employing combinations of colors for the target and background such that the boundary between the target and the background presented a contrast that was visible either only to the green-sensitive receptors of the bee’s eye, or only to the blue-sensitive receptors. The results of these experiments suggest that, in controlling tracking, the measurement of the angular velocity of the target is derived almost exclusively from signals from the green-sensitive receptors, as is the case with previously studied movement-sensitive behavior. However, the measurement of the angular bearing of the target is derived from the blue-sensitive receptors as well as the green-sensitive ones. When the target is closer than ca. 15 cm, approaching bees use translational maneuvers, in addition to rotational ones, to track the moving target. Translational target tracking appears to be driven primarily by signals from the green-sensitive receptors. © 1990, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

Both pollen and nectar are produced only during the male phase of the protandrous disk florets, but pollen is produced bimodally whereas sugar accumulation is constant. Acceptance of heads by native bees was positively correlated with the number of male-phase florets per head, although the number of approaches was not. Native bees responded to increases in nectar amounts, as determined by experiments using bagged heads in which nectar accumulated, by increasing time per head and time spent foraging per floret. Comparisons across an array of visitors showed that large bees were more effective pollinators than small bees, but within the large bee category, there were no differences between specialists and generalists or between males and females. Within the Asteraceae, rewards can influence pollinator behavior directly, whereas in many other advanced groups of angiosperms with floral morphologies that restrict pollinator movement, the number of ways that rewards can directly affect pollinator behavior may be limited. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus

One of the keys to colony survival at such high altitudes is seasonal migration. Nest sites within the subalpine zone of N-central Nepal (above c2800 m) are occupied for a maximum of only 4 months in summer (June through September), while those within the warm-temperate zone (1200-2000 m) may be used for as long as 10 months of the year (February through November). Predation, especially by humans, serves as the impetus for some migratory movements, but a combination of poor foraging conditions and low colony stores also leads laboriosa colonies to migrate. In the steep, narrow valleys inhabited by these bees, the seasonal abundance and distribution of flora resources vary widely within short distances, and colonies need not move >10-20 km to migrate between cliff sites separated by as much as 2000 m in altitude. Late in November or early in December, Laboriosa colonies abandon their nests on the cliffs and move into the forest at altitudes below 2000 m. There they survive the cold winter months of December and January by huddling near the ground. Colonies return to the cliffs in early February to begin the yearly cycle again. -from Author",Article,Scopus

This did not vary significantly over the temperature range 25.3°C≤Ta≤34.0°C, but was significantly lower at Ta=20°C. Over the range 22°C≤Ta≤26°C Pmrel was 0.379±0.07 W g-1. Relative metabolic power Pm rel was calculated from round-about or wind tunnel post-flight thorax cooling rates (exponentially rising from 1 to 5.5°C min-1 per °C temperature difference at wind velocities from 0 to 4.3 m s-1) and from differences between thorax surface temperature and ambient temperature (exponentially decreasing from 6 to 1°C over the same range of wind velocities). A value of Pmrel=0.195±0.09W g-1 was found, independent of wind velocity. From measurements of exhaustion flights of defined fed bees executing prolonged flights (30.6±4.7 min) in front of an open-jet wind tunnel, a relative metabolic power of 0.309±0.05 W g-1 was calculated, which did not vary significantly over the temperature range 25°C≤Ta≤35°C, but was significantly lower at Ta=20°C. Our data from 3 experimentally different determinations of Pmrel are compared to data from a number of literature sources. A critical discussion suggests probable values of approximately 0.3 W g-1 for tethered flights (round-abouts, wind-tunnels), 0.4 W g-1 for medium speed free-foraging flights, and 0.5 W g-1 for hovering flight. Probable mechanical flight power for a muscle efficiency of 0.2 in medium speed free-foraging flight is approximately 70 mW g-1 body mass (equivalent to 5.6 mW for an 'empty' 80 mg bee) and 230 mW g-1 flight muscle mass.

These maps revealed that the African colonies frequently adjusted the allocation of recruits among food patches, recruited for 16-17 different food sites/day over areas of 55-80 km2, and concentrated the majority of recruitment within 1 km of the hives (median foraging distances for the two colonies were 295 and 563 m). In both colonies pollen foragers were more abundant than nectar foragers, and pollen sources indicated by waggle dancers were significantly closer to the hives than nectar sources. Compared to the recruitment patterns of temperate climate colonies, the African colonies had smaller recruitment areas, smaller mean recruitment distances, and a greater emphasis on pollen foraging. These differences may be related to the contrasting survival strategies followed by tropical-versus temperate-climate honey bees. © 1989 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",Article,Scopus

Population flowering synchrony, effective pollinator populations and pollen loads transferred between staminate and pistillate trees were compared among three insect‐pollinated tree species. All three were visited by a wide range of insects, 75% of which (mostly 3–6 mm long) carried conspecific pollen. Fewer than 8% of individual insects were found to be carrying single‐species pollen exclusively and none could be described as specialist pollen foragers. The introduced honeybee carried greater quantities of pollen than any native species but was not necessarily a reliable pollinator. The brief flowering periods in Neolitsea dealbata (3–4 weeks) and Litsea leefeana (4–5 weeks) populations were synchronized among individuals. Flowering in the Diospyros pentamera population extended over 15 weeks and most individuals were in flower for most of this period. Staminate trees began flowering earlier, produced more flowers and attracted relatively more insects than did pistillate trees, suggesting a density‐dependent response of pollinators to flowering performance. Pollen was trapped in greater quantities on insects at staminate trees than at pistillate trees. Insect numbers increased at peak flowering periods and Diptera were the most abundant flower visitors. Anthophilous Coleoptera were more numerous at staminate than at pistillate trees in all three tree species populations. Larger quantities of pollen were mobilized during peak flowering times although the greatest quantities were transferred to pistillate canopies towards the end of the population flowering periods. Diptera carried pollen more often to pistillate N. dealbata and L. leefeana trees than did other groups whereas Coleoptera carried pollen more often to pistillate D. pentamera trees. The two contrasting flowering performances in the three tree species are discussed with reference to mechanisms that facilitate pollen transfer between staminate and pistillate trees.

The main properties of the model were studied by numerical simulations using a pseudo-random generator. It was found that the spatial pattern of search paths could be quantified by a single numerical index of sinuosity. Some advice on the concrete use of this model is given.

Here we present evidence that the spatial precision of the honey bees' dance communication has been ""tuned"" by selection so that recruits are neither so accurate that they usually find areas which have already been depleted nor so inaccurate that they usually fail to find the advertised resources altogether. First, the bees' distance errors are similar in magnitude to their directional errors, and their angular errors decrease greatly with increasing distance to the target (decreasing more than fourfold between 100 and 700 m). As a result, the absolute scatter of recruits remains relatively constant with changing distance to the target (increasing by less than 50% between 100 and 700 m). This is to be expected if the optimal level of imprecision is the same for distance and direction and does not change with the distance of the target from the nest. Second, comparative studies involving three tropical- and one temperate-zone species (all Apis)suggest that the precision of the bees' languages may have been tuned in accordance with the spatial characteristics of the resources each species uses. We suggest that both the round dance, which conveys no directional information for nearby targets, and the high angular divergence in waggle dances indicating targets within several hundred meters of the colony are both understandable in this context. © 1988 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",Article,Scopus

Bees entered each hut to collect a drop of sucrose on the floor. The location of the drop was defined by the same arrangement of four blue and yellow cylindrical landmarks. However, in one hut the drop was between two yellow cylinders and in two other it was to the east of the blue cylinders. On tests with the sucrose missing, bees tended to search in the appropriate area in each hut (Fig. 1), thus showing that they used cues other than the sight of the local landmarks to select the appropriate memory. In a second experiment, the position of the sucrose was specified by yellow cylinders in one hut and by blue triangles in the other. When the arrays were swapped between huts, bees searched in the position specified by the array they encountered (Fig. 2). Thus, memories can be triggered by visual features of local landmarks. Bees were also trained outside to collect food from two platforms 40 m apart. The location of sucrose on one platform was defined by yellow cylinders, and on the other it was defined by blue triangles. When these arrays were exchanged between platforms, bees searched on each platform as though the landmarks had not been swapped. It seems that the more distant surroundings, which fill most of the visual field, may be more potent than the local landmarks in deciding which memory should be retrieved. It is argued that one role of distant landmarks and other contextual cues is to ensure that bees retrieve the correct memory of a constellation of local landmarks while the bees are still some distance away from their goal. Even at a short distance, a bee's current image of local landmarks may differ considerably from its stored representation of those landmarks as seen from the goal. Accurate recall of the appropriate memory will be more certain if it is primed by relatively distant landmarks which present a more constant image as a bee moves in the vicinity of its goal. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

Foraging routes of worker and queen bumble bees (Bombus kirbyellus Curtis) collecting nectar from flowers of the alpine sky pilot, Polemonium viscosum Nutt., were followed and the corolla tube length, corolla diameter, floral scent, and number of flowers on plants visited or bypassed by bees were monitored. Additionally, the number and proportion of flowers visited per inflorescence and distance flown from each to the next were recorded. Queens and workers differed significantly in choice of flowers. However, intra‐inflorescence visitation rates and departure distances were similar between castes. Castes differed in the extent to which visitation reflected patch quality versus individual floral traits. Both queens and workers failed to visit skunky‐flowered plants more often than they failed to visit sweet‐flowered ones, and preferred large over small inflorescences. However, queens visited large‐flowered plants more often than small‐flowered ones, while workers preferred flowers with shorter corolla tubes, regardless of their diameter. Although a number of studies have documented caste specialization on alternate species of host plants, ours is one of the first to show that morphological preferences promote comparable foraging differences between castes on monospecific plant resources. Queens, once on a plant, responded to floral traits by probing more flowers on large inflorescences, as well as on those with broader floral form. Workers did not alter intra‐inflorescence visitation rate in response to floral traits. For workers, no significant relationship was demonstrated between the likelihood of passing by a plant and the number of flowers probed on the previous inflorescence visited. Thus, workers appeared to accept or reject each plant of P. viscosum independently. However, queens passed by fewer plants when leaving rich inflorescences than poor ones. These results suggest that workers use only individual plant acceptability in choosing which plants to visit, whereas queens base plant choice on patch and individual attributes. Such differences between castes in foraging rules when exploiting the same floral resource have received little attention, and provide insights into the heterogeneity of harvestable reward distributions from the perspective of the forager population.

Among them, conopid flies (Conopidae, Diptera) are particularly interesting because they attack foraging bumblebees which are handling flowers, or even on the wing (Frison, 1926; Cumber, 1949; Postner, 1951; Howell, 1967; Askew, 1971). A single egg is attached to (Frison, 1926; Plath, 1934; Cumber, 1949) or inserted into (DeMeijre, 1904; Howell, 1967) the host's abdomen, where the larva hatches and feeds on haemolymph and internal organs. Within 6–10 days the larva passes through three recognizable stages (Pouvreau, 1974) before the fly pupates in situ within the abdomen. The host bee dies shortly before the parasite pupates (Postner, 1951; Smith, 1966) and the parasite overwinters in its puparium; the adult fly then emerges in early summer (Frison, 1926; Townsend, 1935; Cumber, 1949; Postner, 1951). Conopid flies as parasites of bumblebees are known from all major habitats where the hosts occur (e.g. Kröber, 1939; Smith, 1966). However, the effect of parasitism on distribution and abundance of bumblebees is not known. In this preliminary note we have estimated degrees of infestation and concomitant reduction of life span in affected workers.

Our theory throws light on the issue of limits to co-operation in insect societies by emphasizing economic aspects and provides some additional arguments to the currently popular genetic-based kinship-relatedness theories of altruism and co-operation. The theory has implications for understanding the role of laws and institutions in human societies. © 1988.",Article,Scopus

This paper discusses what might constitute an insect's map in terms of a two-part computational model. The first part describes how an insect reaches a goal when the insect is sufficiently close that it can see some of the landmarks which are visible from the goal. The second part considers the problem of navigating when there is no similarity between the view from the release-site and the view from the goal. We start from a model designed to explain how a bee might return to a goal using a two-dimensional ""snapshot"" of the landscape seen from the goal (Collett and Cartwright 1983). To guide its return, the model bee continuously compares its snapshot with its current retinal image and moves so as to reduce the discrepancy between the two. Bees can only be guided in the right direction by the difference between current retinal image and snapshot when there is some resemblance between the two. In a realistically cluttered world, snapshot and retinal image become very dis-similar only a short distance from the goal. To increase the distance from which a model bee can return, the bee takes two snapshots at the goal. The first snapshot excludes landmarks near to the goal and the second snapshot includes them. With close landmarks filtered from both snapshot and retinal image, the match between the two deteriorates gradually as the bee moves away from the goal. A model bee using a filtered snapshot and image finds its way back to the neighbourhood of the goal from a relatively long distance (Fig. 2). The bee then switches to the second snapshot and is guided to the precise spot by its memory of the close landmarks. For longer range guidance, the model bee is equipped with an album of snapshots, each taken at a different location within the terrain. Linked to each snapshot is a vector encoding the distance and direction from the place where the snapshot was taken to the hive. When the bee is displaced to a new position, it selects the snapshot which best matches its current image and follows the associated home-vector back to the hive (Fig. 3). Such a hive-centred map can also be used to devise novel routes to places other than the hive. For instance, a bee can reach a foraging site from anywhere in its terrain by adding the home-vector recalled at the starting position to a vector specifying the distance and direction of the foraging site from the hive. The sum of these two vectors defines a direct trajectory to the foraging site. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

Members of a given clan also share a common foraging territory, spatially segregated from the colony, to which they commute daily. The size of this foraging territory is positively related to clan size. Clan foraging territories are divided into a number of loosely overlapping foraging home ranges (FHRs), each occupied by an individual or mated pair of birds. Bee‐eaters feed solitarily, flycatching to snap up large insects from widely dispersed perches. Each bird tolerates intrusion on its FHR by various members of its own clan, but aggressively excludes individuals belonging to other clans. Birds defend only their own FHR; however, because of the high amount of FHR overlap, the result is a loose form of group defense of the larger clan feeding area. For this reason we refer to the system as one of clan foraging territories. Birds occupying clan foraging territories located more than 1.5 to 2 km from a colony temporarily abandoned them while feeding nestlings. At such times, these birds provisioned their young by foraging near the colony. Birds that abandoned territories foraged less efficiently, provisioned nestlings at a lower rate, and had lower breeding success than did birds that continued use of their foraging territories. A model is developed relating territory abandonment to the energetics of central place foraging. Bee‐eaters typically shift colony locations between successive breeding seasons. Foraging territory locations, in contrast, remain largely stable, resulting in large and unpredictable changes in the quality of any given foraging territory across years (quality being defined as distance from the currently active nesting colony). When a pair bond forms in bee‐eaters, one member typically remains in its natal clan while the other moves into the clan of its partner. At this time, the new pair also establishes its own FHR, generally located within or on the periphery of the clan foraging territory of the natal member. The result of this settlement pattern is that white fronted bee‐eaters live their lives spatially surrounded by members of their natal or their matrimonial clan. This, in turn, increases the likelihood of both mutualistic and nepotistic interactions among clan members. Such benefits include shared territory defense, enhanced security against predation, and maintenance of close social bonds with potential helpers. We hypothesize that the adaptive value of clan foraging territories lies in long‐term familiarity with a foraging area. Such familiarity was demonstrated to lead to improved foraging efficiency and hypothesized to provide both increased security from predation and a more accurate means of monitoring temporal changes in environmental quality. The system of clan foraging territories found in white fronted bee‐eaters differs from the all‐purpose group territories of most other cooperative breeders studied to date in two important ways. First, foraging territories were not limiting in the sense of restricting dispersal and “forcing” offspring to remain with their natal clans. Unoccupied areas of seemingly suitable habitat were present throughout the study area at all times. Birds also showed no tendency to expand their boundaries or move into areas vacated when neighboring clans decreased in size or died off. Second, breeding status and foraging territory ownership are not linked in Merops bullockoides. All pairs defended foraging areas, yet only about 3/4 of them bred in any given year. This percentage did not differ significantly between pairs occupying high quality foraging territories (located near the active nesting colony) and pairs forced to abandon low quality foraging territories located more distantly. We conclude that foraging territories are not a critical ecological constraining factor for white fronted bee‐eaters in Kenya. 1987 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",Article,Scopus

These populations are polymorphic for flower colour and in 4 enzyme systems detected by electrophoresis. Insects, mainly bumblebees, visited P. vulgaris for nectar in small numbers but many flowers must remain unvisited, and fluorescent dust applied to the anthers of 13 inflorescences was only dispersed from 2. The species is self-compatible and largely self-pollinating. Seeds of P. vulgaris have an elaiosome attached to one end and were taken readily by the ant, Lasius niger, which carried the seeds into their nests, often ejecting them again after mutilating the elaiosome. The ants carried the seeds up to 2m. No other adaptations for seed disperal are apparent, but occasional long distance dispersal, eg by wind or on the feet of grazing animals, may have an important effect on the genetic structure of the populations. The large monomorphic groups seem to have established at Oxwich as a result of substantial recolonization from disturbance after 1945. At Whiteford many small recolonizations must follow frequent covering with blown sand leading to a mosaic of small monomorphic patches.

A nectar forager grades her behavior toward a patch in response to both the nectar intake rate of her colony and the quality of her patch. This results in the threshold in patch quality for acceptance of a patch being higher when the colonial intake rate of nectar is high than when it is low. Thus colonies can adjust their patch selectivity so that they focus on rich sources when forage is abundant, but spread their workers among a wider range of sources when forage is scarce. Foragers assess their colony's rate of nectar intake while in the nest, unloading nectar to receiver bees. The ease of unloading varies inversely with the colonial intake rate of nectar. Foragers assess patch quality while in the field, collecting nectar. By grading their behavior steeply in relation to such patch variables as distance from the nest and nectar sweetness, foragers give their colony high sensitivity to differences in profitability among patches. When a patch's quality declines, its foragers reduce their rate of visits to the patch. This diminishes the flow of nectar from the poor patch which in turn stimulates recruitment to rich patches. Thus a colony can swiftly redistribute its forager force following changes in the spatial distribution of rich food sources. The fundamental currency of nectar patch quality is not net rate of energy intake, (Gain-Cost)/Time, but may be net energy efficiency, (Gain-Cost)/Cost. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

Dye thus does not provide an accurate means of assessing exacty where or how far pollen travels in this plant-pollinator system.

Predictions based on maximisation of rate of energy gain, defined as net energy gained per unit time foraging, are significantly different from observed behaviour (Schmid-Hempel et al. 1985). In this paper we consider the effect of varying travel times in addition to flow rate. The predictions of an extended version of our theoretical model are confronted with experimental results obtained by Núñez (1982). Núñez found that bees filled their crops more fully for higher flows and longer travel times. We show that when the cost of carrying a load is considered, this trend can be predicted by maximising either energetic efficiency or net rate of gain. Figure 1 shows, however, that maximisation of net rate of gain can only produce an acceptable quantitative fit if unreasonably high costs are assumed to result from carrying the load. Energetic efficiency instead generates a good quantitative fit for acceptable assumptions about this cost (Fig. 2). © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

Br. on sunny days when the ambient temperature exceeded 20 °C. The flower buds on a raceme opened subsynchronously displaying the brightly-colored, actinomorphic perianth and exposed the contrastingly-colored, scented and ornamented column. In T. nuda the staminodes and the filament of the fertile stamen are fused to one another producing an inflated hood over the anther. This staminodal hood is terminated in two non-ornamental, but brightly-colored, central lobes and two terete lateral lobes bearing approximately 400 white trichomes. Each trichome bears a double chain of 30-40 spherical, rugulose cells. Female bees, in the genus Lasioglossum (Halictidae), were observed to land directly on the hood and curled their bodies around the four lobed tip of the staminodal complex. The bees attempted to forage on the lobes as if they were collecting pollen from fertile, poricidal stamens. These bees applied thoracic vibration to the yellowish central lobes and actively scraped the trichome clusters (Pseudopollen) with their forelegs. Bees carried the pollinaria of T. nuda dorsally on their abdomens. Abdominal contact with the rostellum appeared to occur when the female bee disengaged herself from the staminodal hood. Observations made of bees on co-blooming flowers, and analyses of pollen loads collected by bees suggested that the orchid flower mimics the guild of blue-purple flowers that lack floral nectar but offer pollen in poricidal anthers. The models of T. nuda are co-blooming Liliaceae in the genera Dichopogon and Thysanotus. However, nectarless, buzz-pollinated flowers are also extensively distributed over the orchid's range. More than 30% of the flowers in the T. nuda population had their pollinaria removed, suggesting a high capacity for cross-pollination in an orchid genus usually considered to be self-pollinated via mechanical autogamy.

Directional movement by foraging honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) was studied on several flower arrays. The most frequent move among equidistant flower stalks was straight ahead from stalk to stalk with frequencies decreasing for increasing turn angles. Turns to the left were about equal in frequency to turns to the right. Bees maintained directionality when moving from flower stalks that had been rotated 90° counterclockwise while the bee was on the stalk (no difference between moves from rotated stalks and unrotated controls). Thus, directionality is maintained by the bee and is not an artefact of flower distribution. Bees also maintained directionality when the entire array was rotated around the flower stalk the bee was on. Thus, bees use an external cue to orientate in a given direction rather than fixing on an inflorescence within the flower array. Bees foraging on very different flower arrays differed in patterns of directionality and in distances flown between flower stalks. Therefore, even though bees maintain directionality using external cues, flower distribution can nevertheless influence flight patterns. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell.

Despite sharing most pollen resources and nectar of the same quality with 20 introduced colonies of the African honey bee (Apis mellifera), native stingless bees of 12 species were largely unaffected by its activity. Pollen and nectar harvested by the honey bees were 10–200 times that procured by 17 stingless bee colonies. This discrepancy in total harvest and general lack of competitive effect is explained by a honey bee foraging area over 10 times that of the native bees, and apparent foraging shifts to escape competition with honey bees, thus reduced potential overlap in foraging sites. Seven cases of direct resource competition for pollen or nectar were documented, out of 31 tests. Rare periods of intensive harvest were diminished by competing African honey bees. Such harvest peaks lasted for only a few hours in 13 days of observation. Despite average duration of 4% foraging time for each species, peaks included as much as 51% total harvest. Calculations based upon colony populations, food stores and flight range show that if African honey bees persist at a density of 1 colony per km2, colonies of some stingless bee species may disappear after 10 years. Their chances of escaping food competition by taxonomic specialization on flowers seem slight. © 1986, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus

This weak self-compatibility and a positive relation between the percentage of seeds set by outcrossed plants and the distance between pollen donor and recipient plants indicate that this population could be susceptible to inbreeding depression. Limited resources for seed development apparently constrained maximal seed production, based on low seed set (40.6%) by hand-pollinated plants and positive correlations for these plants between plant size and the number and size of seeds set. In contrast, naturally-pollinated plants set a smaller proportion of their ovules, suggesting that limited pollinator service reduced the quantity of seeds produced in this population. Free-foraging bees usually removed more than half of the available pollen in a single visit, so that individual plants probably have few opportunities to disseminate their pollen.

Some insects do incur additional energy cost on transporting and storing food. Energy cost of foraging ranges from 2 to 5 % of the energy gained in bees and wasps. Initiation of flight, in large and insulated insects obligatorily requires 'warming-up' of muscle temperature and maintenance of endothermy by over 20°C above the ambient. Over-heating is avoided by pumping the cooler abdominal blood into the hot thorax. Pollinating insects include (i) hovering high-energy foragers, which expend more energy and visit more flowers per unit time and (ii) walking low-energy foragers, which expend less energy and visit few flowers per unit time. Decreasing of ""wing loading"" is another strategy adopted by saturniids, which do not feed as adults. Most bees forage, when flowers are just blooming, and when they have maximum nectar reward to offer. From the model study on energy cost of oviposition, it has been shown that Sceliphron violaceum makes greater and greater effort to complete the process of food provisioning and sealing the larval nest, when it has invested more and more energy on foraging and provisioning spiders to the larviposited young ones. © 1985 Indian Academy of Sciences.",Article,Scopus

At most 12 flowers were visited in a sequence. The mean between-flower transfer distance was estimated to be 6.2 cm, within-plant pollen transfers being recorded as zero. When all within-plant movements were excluded the mean was 22.5 cm. The distribution of transport distances differed from what I observed for honey-bees which occasionally foraged on dense stands of S. perennis.

Honeybees are positively phototactic when they leave a feeding place and start to fly back to the hive. The strength of this natural phototactic response in individually marked bees was measured without interfering with their foraging behaviour. 2. Absolute sensitivity of this phototactic response to a point light source is in the range of 8.3 · 107 quanta s-1 for 537 nm. This corresponds to about 5 absorbed quanta in 28 green receptors over the integration time of 60 ms. 3. We conclude that the properties of the monopolar cells or higher order visual interneurons rather than those of the photoreceptors control the intensity dependence of the response because the slopes (n) of the response intensity functions (R/log I) are steep (n: 1.0-2.65) and wavelength dependent. Blue light (439 nm) causes the steepest function. 4. The effect of residual light adaptation on the R/log I-function and the spectral sensitivity (S(λ)) is negligible under the experimental conditions chosen, since the time course of dark adaptation is fast (τ≦1 min). 5. The blue and green receptors contribute about equally to the S(λ) of this natural phototactic response, the UV receptors somewhat less (Fig. 5). 6. Colour mixing experiments, used to test colour vision in phototaxis, reveal no significant deviation from a simple linear summation of the quantal fluxes, irrespective of the spectral mixture used. We conclude, therefore, that under the experimental conditions colour vision is very unlikely to play a role in the phototactic behaviour of the honeybee. 7. All our results (steep R/logI-functions, fast dark adaptation, S(λ) and the absence of colour vision) support to notion that the natural phototactic response is controlled by neuronal pooling, most likely in the lamina M1 monopolar cells. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

However, bumble bees moved differently in areas containing landmarks versus uniform flower stands in two respects: 1) Inter-plant flight distances were significantly longer in uniform areas. 2) Significantly fewer backwards-oriented flights were made in uniform areas.

This behavior was not observed in other years. Despite the fact that Ipomopsis lacks floral features associated with bee visitation, bumblebees foraged on Ipomopsis at a rate only somewhat slower than that for a typical bee flower. Because of the deep corolla, bumblebees are able to probe only a limited distance but in 1981 nectar was more accessible due to a higher standing crop than in other years. While foraging on Ipomopsis, bees were able to obtain a net energetic profit similar to that obtained from their primary forage species. Floral choice is thus governed primarily by profitability (which can overcome innate preferences for bee flowers). The features of hummingbird flowers pose no absolute barrier to bee visitation.

Apis cerana and A. florea forage over short distances; at 3 of the 6 sites in this trial A. cerana did not visit feeders beyond 500 m. In A. dorsata the change in dance tempo with increasing distance to forage was much slower and similar, in this respect, to that reported for A. mellifera. Both A. dorsata and A. mellifera are able to forage over long distances, although in this trial 72% of A. dorsata foragers did not fly beyond 400 m. Apis cerana and A. florea may be unable to communicate long distances to food sources, as these distances would be indicated by very slow dances. These potential intrinsic limits, and observed constraints on foraging distance in A. cerana, suggests that beekeepers should manage A. cerana in small, well separated apiaries.

As predicted by the model, there was a decrease in the proportion of items brought to the nest that were small with increasing travel time. The model predicted a threshold for dropping small items from the nestling diet. Statistical estimation of a threshold from the observed data by probit analysis showed that the predicted threshold was within 2 standard errors of the observed.

The increased frequency of long-distance bee flights associated with the abundant low-quality reward blossoms in the nectar-robbed patch served to increase neighborhood size relative to the control area.

Nectar is produced by five species, harvestable pollen by four species and detectable perfume by three species, all of which features are usually absent from the red phase. The timing of the colour change in all species also corresponds to loss of stigma receptivity, completion of pollination and onset of ovule seed) swelling. Six species also undergo minor morphometric changes which discourage visitation. In all species, colour change is non‐inducible by pollinators, taking 2–30 days to complete. In three protandrous species, all available pollen may be removed in the first visit, requiring transport of non‐self pollen to rewardless flowers during the 10 h period of the yellow phase. These species are highly floriferous and occur in dense patches.

Dispersal over long distances is normally limited to accidentally transported plants or fruits.

The efficiency of sucrose solution uptake by Melipona was compared to that of domesticated European Apis mellifera. Dynamics of nectar foraging were also recorded for 3 of the Melipona visiting the forest shrub, Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae). 1. Sugar concentration in nectar brought to nests averaged from 21 to 60% sugar for 15 colonies of M. fasciata, M. compressipes triplaridis, M. fuliginosa and M. marginata micheneri. Concentrations ranged from 19 to 72%, and all species collected nectars ranging at least between 24 and 63% sugar. However, M. compressipes and M. marginata preferred higher concentrations and foraged less on dilute nectars. Peak colony nectar harvest occured in late morning or early afternoon; peak pollen harvest was in early morning. 2. Imbibing rates of bees given 20, 30, 45, 60 or 70% sucrose solutions were highest at ≦45% sucrose, but caloric intake was most rapid at 60% sucrose for all species. All but M. marginata displayed greater net intake rates than domesticated European Apis mellifera. A foraging choice model incorporating caloric reward and imbibing rates of bees suggests M. compressipes and M. marginata should specialize on richer nectars. Rate of caloric intake per forager weight was higher for all Melipona (0.03-0.13g) than for A. mellifera (0.10 g). 3. The nectar of Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae), a shrub pollinated exclusively by Melipona, progressed from 35 to 60% sugar during the day. Bees foraged most when nectar was below 60% concentration, a pattern best explained as the result of intercolony competition and greater availability of lower quality nectar. 4. Sugar concentration in nectar harvested by colonies rose from lower to higher values through the day for Melipona. The increasing caloric reward of nectar is adaptive in exploiting foraging preferences of such bees. As standing nectar crop is depleted by competing bees, a gradual shift to more rewarding nectar should promote increased bee foraging range, more flower visits during a foraging trip, floral constancy, and genetic outcrossing. 5. The nectar load capacity of A. mellifera is greater than that of Melipona.

Strong pollen trimorphism in Pontederia cordata enables an evaluation of this hypothesis. In an investigation of pollen flow patterns in different parts of the North American range of the species, legitimate pollination of some morphs was observed in all but one population investigated. However at only one site (Ft. McCoy, Florida) was Darwin's hypothesis confirmed for the three floral morphs. The long‐styled morph most frequently exhibited legitimate pollination, the mid‐styled morph was intermediate, and the short‐styled morph rarely experienced legitimate pollination. Temporal variation in pollen flow was observed during the flowering season of P. cordata. Total stigmatic pollen loads decreased as the density of inflorescences and activity of pollinators declined. In spite of variable total loads the legitimate component was relatively constant in the long‐ and mid‐styled forms, while in the short‐styled form this measure increased as the season progressed. Little variation was detected between stigmatic samples collected at different times during a single day. Legitimate pollination may be inhibited by local foraging of pollinators and the spatial segregation of floral morphs. At Paugh Lake (Ontario) over 75% of all bumble bee flights are among the five nearest neighbours of a particular inflorescence. In the same population, there is a probability of over 70% that the nearest three neighbours of an inflorescence are of the same floral morph. Despite these influences, legitimate pollination occurs in P. cordata, suggesting substantial pollen carryover. Copyright © 1984, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",Article,Scopus

Male flowers have longer and more frequently white corona scales which may mimic the projecting white styles of female flowers. Male and female flowers were observed to secrete similar quantities of nectar sugar on the first morning of opening, but female flowers secreted more than males subsequently, and the total volumes of nectar secreted by female flowers were considerably greater. Male plants varied more than females in the total quantity of nectar sugar secreted per flower. Nectar concentration was nearly always greater in male flowers than in female flowers.

Some visitors, including those that were most numerous at some sites, made most or all of their visits illegitimately. In the field in 1980 many visitors were observed to discriminate in favour of male flowers, which were much more numerous than female flowers. In the experimental population in 1981, many visitors discriminated in favour of female flowers, which were more numerous than in the field populations but were still substantially outnumbered by male flowers. Some individual bumblebees showed a change in preferences during the day, disciminating in favour of female flowers only during the afternoon, when the nectar resources available from female flowers were proportionately greater. The total numbers of visits that were observed to female and male flowers in the experimental population corresponded closely with the total quantities of nectar sugar available from each sex. The importance of the different insect visitors and of their discrimination between sexes in pollination is discussed.

This model analyses the efficiency of sugar intake, or energy flux, which for nectarivores closely approximates the rate of net energy gain. For both steady state and some non-steady flows of nectars, this energy flux is shown to be maximal at particular sugar concentrations referred to here as the maximum flux concentration. Higher concentrations actually yield lower energy intake rates because the concomitant rapid increase in viscosity sharply reduces the rate of fluid intake. For pure sucrose solutions, the maximum flux concentration is 22%. For flower nectars, which are chemically more complex, the maximum flux concentration is predicted to be closer to 26%, using the first viscosity measures obtained for flower nectars. This concentration is shown to be essentially independent of the pollinator's feeding organ morphology and of the type of potential inducing nectar flow. It is proposed that this concentration applies for virtually all pollinators that select nectars with maximal energy flux. However not all pollinators are expected to select such nectars because this 26% concentration is not necessarily ""optimal"". The model predicts that optimal sugar concentrations vary for particular pollinators as a function of two primary factors: (1) the energy flux derived from the nectar, as discussed above, as well as (2) the relative contribution of transit costs to overall foraging costs. Relatively ""dilute"" nectars, with sugar concentrations close to the maximal flux value, are predicted for flowers pollinated by organisms that minimize feeding time to reduce high feeding costs, such as that of hovering or of exposure to enhanced predation while feeding. More concentrated nectars are predicted for flowers pollinated by nectarivores that incur high foraging transit costs relative to feeding costs. Flowers pollinated by hovering pollinators, including many hummingbirds, hawkmoths and bats, have nectars with mean sugar concentrations in close accord with the 26% maximum flux concentration predicted. Moreover, these nectars have relatively low concentrations of nonsugar constituents, which increase viscosity and thereby decrease sugar flux. Over 75% of the flowers examined in this study, which are pollinated primarily by territorial hummingbird species, provide nectars that allow sugar uptake with an efficiency of 90% or greater of the maximal value. According to the model, these data suggest that feeding costs of these pollinators far outweigh foraging transit costs. In contrast, the model suggests that flower nectars taken by traplining hummingbirds and by bees, with sugar concentrations significantly above the maximum flux value, reflect the higher costs of foraging flight relative to costs of feeding for these pollinators. Increasing temperature decreases nectar viscosity, and thereby increases absolute nectar uptake rates sharply. This leads to a number of predictions regarding foraging behavior as well as flower location, orientation, and color. However, the maximum flux concentration is shown to be practically invariable over a wide range of temperatures-increasing by only 2% sugar from 10°C to 30°C. Thus, contrary to previous expectations, little change in average sugar concentrations of flowers pollinated by particular groups of nectarivores is expected from cooler to warmer regions. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

I therefore investigated the relationship between flight distance and flight time for bumblebees and butterflies foraging on Senecio integerrimus and S. crassulus in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. I also compared patterns of pollinator visitation and seed set in two adjacent 15x 15 m plots in a population of S. integerrimus; one plot was experimentally thinned of flowering stalks, while the other was left at natural density. Mean flight distance had no effect on mean flight time or the number of florets or heads visited per unit time. There were no significant differences between the two plots in the rate at which plants received visits, although visitation rates varied through the season, with greatest activity at peak flowering. Pollinators were more selective in their visits to plants in the high-density plot, however. Bumblebee-visited plants in the dense plot had a lower variance in stalk height than the plant population average, while butterfly-visited plants in the dense plot had more heads than the population average. Plant density had no effect on number of heads visited per plant, but number of heads visited by bumblebees was correlated with number of heads per plant. Efficiency of visitation (percentage of flowering heads visited), declined with inflorescence size. Flowering plant density had no effect on seed production, and inflorescence size did not affect the percentage of florets setting seed. In Senecio, flowering phenology patterns and differences among pollinators in foraging behavior may have more important consequences for seed set and gene flow patterns than plant density or plant size. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

Volume and sugar concentration of samples from individual flowers were measured and the sugar contained was calculated. The rate of sugar production remains constant for all ambient humidities and extraction intervals investigated; the mean value for all 180 samples is 1.55 mg sucrose equivalents/24h. Sugar concentration of secretion nectar is linearly dependent on ambient humidity over the range investigated, and nectar volume and sugar concentration change according to the theoretically expected curve for solutions with a sugar content of 1.55 mg sucrose. The response of secretion nectar to steplike changes in ambient humidity was investigated and the transient function described. The nectaries respond immediately to changes in ambient humidity. The consequences of the results for nectar production and nectar reward of individual flowers in the field and for the optimal foraging of pollinators are discussed.

The distance between the two flowers and the concentration of nectar rewards were varied. Nine bees were tested, each over several days. Of the three dance variables examined, the number of reversals in the dance per minute (RATE) most often gave the highest and consistently signed correlation coefficients when paired with the mean caloric reward received per flower visit (CALGAIN), the net caloric gain per unit time (NET), and the mean caloric cost to fly to and visit a flower (CALCOST). In general, RATE is positively correlated with CALGAIN (range of positive coefficients, 0.12 to 0.50) and NET (range, 0.15 to 0.40) and negatively correlated with CALCOST (range, -0.01 to -0.28). Additionally, the probability of dancing after foraging is generally positively associated with CALGAIN and negatively associated with CALCOST.

Bees avoid revisiting flowers by being able to differentiate recently visited from unvisited flowers. This recognition occurs while bees are flying over open flowers and appears to be a response to the amount of available pollen within flowers. Random foraging with respect to direction is the optimal strategy when the probability of flower revisitation is low. Bumblebees appear to be moving preferentially between nearest neighbors, again as predicted by foraging theory. This behavior causes the establishment of pollen patches in the P. gracilis population. Unlike other pollinators studied in similar situations, bumblebees on P. gracilis do not forage utilizing an area-restricted searching behavior. Because floral reward quality can be assessed at low cost by bees foraging on P. gracilis, their tendency to move to nearby flowers even after encountering a poor quality blossom apparently yields a higher rate of net energy intake than does area-restricted searching. The data indicate that bumblebees exhibit great plasticity in foraging behavior and that they are able to forage efficiently under a wide range of environmental conditions. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

The measurements of Yes'kov & Sapozhnikov (1976) suggest that electrostatic potentials on foraging honeybees can reach hundreds of volts. Pollen grains of oilseed rape, Brassica napus L., subjected experimentally to potentials of this order, jumped a distance that increased approximately as the square of the voltage, between two pin electrodes on which, in some experiments, were impaled an anther or stigma of oilseed rape or a freshly‐killed honeybee. Most floral surfaces were insulated, but there was a low‐impedance path to earth via the stigma, and the electrostatic field due to an approaching charged bee must therefore concentrate there. Thus, if electrostatic potentials of this magnitude occur in nature they may increase the chance that pollen from bees will reach the stigma rather than other floral surfaces, as well as enabling pollen to jump from anther to bee and from bee to stigma across an air gap of the order of 0.5 mm.

One species produces nectar while the other does not. Bees, upon visiting nectar producing flowers tend to empty them of nectar and by frequently moving between close neighbors, create a patchily distributed resource base. Bees maximize their foraging efficiency in such an environment by using an area-restricted searching behavior and flying distances inversely correlated with the quality of reward received. Pollen collecting bumblebees do not create a patchy environment and maximize their foraging efficiency by more consistently moving shorter distances. Pollen collecting bumblebees are significantly more likely to revisit flowers and to visit more flowers per inflorescence than are nectar gathering bumblebees.

It flowers annually, and has an extended flowering period, with individuals flowering somewhat asynchronously, presenting small flowers with minimal visual lures. The flowers are visited by an unrestricted array of apparently imprecise opportunistic feeders, predominated by trigonid bees and butterflies. Most of these visitors exhibit low fidelity and forage opportunistically on numerous competing tree species. Presentation of nectar in alternating rhythms between the male and hermaphrodite trees appears to induce pollinator movement between them. Out of such alternating visits between the sexes, a low level of short‐range inter‐tree pollen transfer by trigonids and butterflies seems to occur. Despite the elaborate system which promotes pollinator movement between the sexes, this species has retained a low level of self‐compatibility. The physical barriers to pollinator movement in the understorey, and high interspecific competition for pollinators by a large number of tree species, appear therefore to make it difficult to maintain an obligate outbreeding system.

Away from its mating place, a resident male rarely responds to other insects. On its mating site, however, it is territorial, attacking alien species, such as bees, wasps, and butterflies, as well as conspecific intruders. Territorial duty is demanding, and resident males take rest periods outside their territories whenever they can. When prevented from doing so, either by sky conditions which confine them to the territory, or by crowding which eliminates many neutral sites, they become increasingly aggressive. Males on open, horizontal territories (e.g., in flowerbeds) are more likely to notice intruders, and therefore are more liable to attack them, than males on vertical territories (e.g., on broad-leaved shrubs). The aggressiveness of E. tenax has social and ecological ramifications beyond its own species, since bees may stop foraging and aphidophagous syrphids may not oviposit in places where drone flies are exceptionally active. © 1981, Entomological Society of Canada.

Worker honeybees contacting a queen can transport the queen's inhibitory signal, queen substance, to other workers unable to contact the queen. Airborne dispersal of queen substance is at most a minor mechanism for queen substance transmission. 2. This worker transport of queen substance is an important supplement to queen substance dispersal by direct queen-worker contacts. For although colonies lose their inhibition against queen rearing within 10 h of queen loss, a queen contacts only approximately 35% of the broodnest workers in 10 h. 3. The queen facilitates queen substance dispersal by frequently standing stationary, at which times workers can thoroughly contact her, and by occasionally making a major shift in her position within the nest. 4. Queen attendance by workers is strongly age-dependent, with 3-9 days being the age range for intense contact with the queen. 5. Workers that have made extensive (&gt;30s) queen contact appear to behave as 'messengers' dispersing queen substance. They walk more rapidly, antennate nestmates and receive inspections more frequently, and perform fewer labor acts in the 30 min following queen contact than do randomly chosen broodnest workers of the same age (control bees). 6. The following observations support the surface transport model over the food exchange model for queen substance transmission by workers: (1) the higher frequency of antennations with nestmates and of inspections by nestmates for messenger bees relative to control bees, (2) the close correlation (r=0.76) for messenger bees between duration of queen contact and number of inspections by nestmates, and (3) the low frequency of food donations (x=1.8) compared with nestmate antennations (x=56.4) by messenger bees in the 30 min following queen contact. 7. There are no messenger bee specialists cycling rapidly between contacts with the queen and workers. 8. Messenger bees were analyzed by gas chromatography for (E)-9-oxodec-2-enoic acid.

The daily courses of these two components are strongly correlated with each other, and also correlated with the daily variation in misdirection (""Mißweisung"") in the bees' dances, and thus with the periodic variations of the intensity of the earth's magnetic field (Figs. 3 to 5). Thus, the variations in the sounds produced represent at the same time the daily course of misdirection. Although individual bees produce sounds of different basic pitches (Basistonlagen) - with maximum wavelengths of the two components mentioned - the absolute range of change is about the same for all dancing bees (single pulses: 0.3 ms/10° misdirection, sequences of vibrational pulses: 2.0 ms/10° misdirection). Amplification of natural field strength by a factor of about 3 to 5 does not abolish the strong correlations existing between the two sound components and misdirection; the range of changing, on the contrary, increases with the amplification of field strength (Figs. 6 and 7). Under conditions that eliminate misdirection, e. g. compensation for the magnetic field (Figs. 8 and 9) or dancing on a horizontal comb - regardless of whether the observations are done under natural field strength (Fig. 10) or following artificial amplification of field intensity (Fig. 11) - the dancing bees produce their basic pitches throughout the day. On the vertical comb, the same phenomenon is noticed at the socalled zeropoints, under conditions of both normal and increased field strength. If bees are foraging far away from their hive, the sounds they produced when they return always start from their individual basic pitches and adapt, within a few minutes, to the wavelengths characteristic of the prevailing situation as regards field strength and dancing angle (Fig. 12). In general, the organization of the sounds essentially confirms former results, although their mean frequency range is somewhat higher (278 Hz for the single pulse and 33 Hz for the sequence of vibrational pulses resp.). A peculiar feature of the dance of only two bees is described, the so-called ""continuous sound"". These two bees produced sounds both during the tail-wagging run and the return half cycle. The general mechanism of the field effect and the mechanism of reception of magnetic stimuli are discussed, as well as the possibility of sound communication in honeybees. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

The number of florets visited per unit time was independent of flower head density from 20 to at least 290 heads/m2, in part because the bees utilized more florets per head at low flower head densities, and also because they approached but rejected more flower heads at high rather than at low flower head densities. 2. Previously visited clover-heads were approached but often rejected, while unvisited heads were not rejected. 3. The bees behaved markedly different while foraging in patches of flowers which were available to all foragers, than in those which had been screened and contained on the average 3.9 times more sugar; they tendent to move through depleted areas and to concentrate in rich areas. On successive flower-head visits in depleted areas they moved more forward than backward (82% vs. 18%), while in rich areas they tended to move almost as much backward as forward 47% vs. 53%). 4. The distances of inter-head moves were approximately twice as long in depleted as in rich areas. 5. The bees visited almost as many florets per unit time in the rich as in the depleted areas (32 vs. 35 per min). But in the rich patches they probed on the average into 11.6 florets per head in contrast to only 2.3 florets per depleted head. 6. In an experiment with B. vagans workers foraging from Aconitum napellus inflorescences, the bees did not reject previously visited flowers, and they moved upward in successive flower visits on inverted as well as on unaltered inflorescences. On horizontal inflorescences they moved both right and left. The movements are not a direct response to nectar differences, nor to differences in average nectar distributions. The systematic foraging behavior on vertical inflorescences may thus be a mechanism of reducing the revisiting of just-emptied flowers. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

The slopes of the functions describing the relationship between mean wagtime and feeder distance varied between 0.0007 and 0.0020 s/m for the various hives (Fig. 1). The magnitude of individual wagtime errors is similar for animals from different hives (Fig. 4), thus errors in communicated distance vary remarkably between colonies (since they depend on the slope). 4. In 85% of all cases there is a significant added variance component among individuals (""between-individuals"" error).

Such would only be the case, if every point in the sky had its own exclusive direction of polarization. In the e-vector pattern of the sky, however, each direction of polarization is found at many different points. For compass orientation the insect has therefore to use some information on the geometry of the e-vector pattern in the sky. In general, each e-vector occurs twice at a given elevation (Fig. 1). The angular separation ω between the positions of identical e-vectors depends on the elevations of the e-vectors above the horizon and on the height of the sun. Except at sunrise and sunset, ω ≠ 180°. If a bee is trained to fly in a certain direction to a food source, the direction of its waggle dance on a horizontal comb points directly towards the goal (provided that the bee is able to view the sky). However, if the bee is only allowed to view a single e-vector in the sky (or a single artificially adjusted e-vector), it should perform ambiguous orientation. One expects the bee to prefer two dance directions separated by the proper angular distance ω. One of these two dance directions should point at the food source. The bees indeed dance in two directions. However, there are two unexpected results: (1) The angular distance between the two preferred directions invariably amounts to ω=180°. (2) One of the preferred directions points closely, but not exactly at the goal. What one can deduce from these single-e-vector tests is that the bee uses a rather generalized internal representation of the e-vector pattern in the sky. This paper describes the general e-vector characteristic applied by a dancing bee that only views a single e-vector in the sky (diameter of the celestial patch or the artificially polarized light source ≦10°). This general e-vector characteristic of the bee (Fig. 9) more closely fits the mean e-vector distribution near the zenith than e-vector distributions in other parts of the sky (Fig. 11). © 1978 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

The 'compromise' dance angles observed when the orienting stimuli due to light and gravity conflict indicate that for intermediate intensity settings the bees favour light orientation for small light-gravity angles but favour gravity orientation when this angle is large. The re-orienting effect of light on the 'gravity dance modes', or of gravity on 'light dance modes', is not a simple trigonometric function of either angular variable, but is strongly skewed; it appears not to depend upon the foraging flight angle with respect to the sun.

Features of suitable nest sites are analyzed, but it does not appear that nest site availability limits colony density or determines colony dispersion. Rather, food limitation is suggested by a linear relationship between the logarithm of colony biomass and the logarithm of foraging “home range.” Colonies were uniformly dispersed intraspecifically in 4 species. The pattern in a 5th species could not be distinguished from a random dispersion. Partial nest counts in 3 more species suggested a clumped dispersion in at least I species. The 4 species with uniform nest spacing all use pheromones for recruitment in foraging, whereas the remaining 4 species do not. The 3 most uniformly dispersed species are also intraspecifically aggressive at food sources. We propose that colony spacing is accomplished in these species by aggressive prevention of new colony establishment.

The mean foraging range of bees from various apiaries within orchards varied from 80 to 261 m; it depended greatly upon the spatial distribution of apiaries. Inter-orchard flights were appreciable from orchards with high colony densities (c. 8/ha) to orchards without colonies or with low colony densities.

The impact of air temperature proved to be the most important of the weather conditions. Rising temperature significantly increases the speed of flower visits and simultaneously decreases the number of flowers visited per inflorescence. Sky covered has slight reserved effect whilst light wind (below 4.5 m per sec) and flight distance within 600 metres do not affect the foraging rates of honeybees on red clover inflorescences. Strong wind decreases the speed of flower visits or prevents it. It is concluded that increasing length of corolla tube and decreasing amount and/or availability of nectar affect adversely the flower visiting speed. The type of behaviour is also important, since pure pollen gatherers are much more rapid flower visitors than the remaining behavioural classes whose foraging rates are closely similar to each other at the same locality. The details suggest that the foraging rates of honeybees are governed by a host of factors none of which seem to be highly superior to the others. For this reason, the foraging rates of honeybees are always affected by a complex system of factors individual components of which can partly interfere with or support each other, however, certain factors tend to have geographical tendencies. Zur Wirkung von Umweltfaktoren auf die Geschwindigkeit des Blumenbesuches der Honigbiene auf Rotkleefeldern Es wurde festgestellt, daß die Geschwindigkeit des Blumenbesuches der Honigbiene von mehreren Umweltfaktoren stark beeinflußt wird. Von den Witterungsfaktoren erwies sich die Temperatur als der bedeutendste. Steigende Temperatur erhöhte in signifikanter Weise die Geschwindigkeit des Blumenbesuches und verminderte zugleich die Zahl der besuchten Blumen per Blütenstand. Die Bevölkerung rief eine mäßige entgegengesetzte Wirkung hervor. Mäßiger Wind (4,4 m/sec) sowie die Flugweite (innerhalb 600 m) zeigten keinen Einfluß auf die Geschwindigkeit des Blumenbesuches. Starker Wind dagegen verminderte die Besuchstätigkeit oder verhinderte ihn sogar. Die zunehmende Länge der Blütenröhre ging parallel mit einer Erschwerung der Nektargewinnung und reduzierte die Geschwindigkeit der Blumenbesucher. Auch der Typus des Verhaltens war von Bedeutung: Die echten Pollensammler besuchten die Blumen viel schneller als andere Sammlertypen. Die festgestellten Zusammenhänge zeigen, daß die Besuchsgeschwindigkeit der Honigbiene von mehreren Faktoren gemeinsam beeinflußt wird, von welchen jedoch keiner von wesentlich stärkerem Einfluß als die andere zu sein scheint. Die Blumenbesuchsgeschwindigkeit der Honigbiene wird somit von einem Faktorenkomplex beeinflußt, dessen einzelne Elemente sich gegenseitig verstärken oder abschwächen können. Manche Faktoren zeigen aber die Tendenz zu geographischen Verschiedenheiten. 1976 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",Article,Scopus

However, rapid rates of cooling because of small body size in most cases precludes appreciable endothermy. The body temperature of small flies in flight is probably close to ambient temperature, and that of flying butterflies and locusts is 5° to 10°C above ambient temperature. Many moths and bumblebees are insulated with scales and hair, and their metabolism during flight can cause the temperature of the flight muscles to increase 20° to 30°C above ambient temperature. Curiously, those insects which (because of size, insulation) retain the most heat in the thorax during flight, also require the highest muscle temperature in order to maintain sufficient power output to continue flight. The minimum muscle temperature for flight varies widely between different species, while the maximum temperature varies over the relatively narrow range of 40° to 45°C. As a consequence, those insects that necessarily generate high muscle temperatures during flight must maintain their thoracic temperature within a relatively narrow range during flight. Active heat loss from the thorax to the abdomen prevents overheating of the flight motor and allows some large moths to be active over a wide range of ambient temperatures. Bumblebees similarly transfer heat from the flight musculature into the abdomen while incubating their brood by abdominal contact. Many of the larger insects would remain grounded if they did not actively increase the temperature of their flight muscles prior to flight. Male tettigoniid grasshoppers elevate their thoracic temperature prior to singing. In addition, some of the social Hymenoptera activate the ""flight"" muscles specifically to produce heat not only prior to flight but also during nest temperature regulation. During this ""shivering"" the ""flight"" muscles are often activated in patterns different from those during flight. The muscles contract primarily against each other rather than on the wings. However, the rate of heat production during shivering and flight is primarily a function of the action potential frequency rather than of the patterns of activation. Thermoregulation is a key factor in the energetics of foraging of some of the flower-visiting insects. The higher their muscle temperature the more flowers they can visit per unit time. When food supplies are ample, bees may invest relatively large amounts of energy for thermoregulation. While shivering to maintain high body temperatures during the short intervals they are perched on flowers (as well as while in the nest), bumblebees often expend energy at rates similar to the rates of energy expenditure in flight. Unlike vertebrates, which usually regulate their body temperature at specific set points, the body temperature of insects is labile. It often appears to be maintained near the lower temperature at which the muscles are able to perform the function at hand. The insects' thermal adaptations may not differ as much from those of vertebrates as previously supposed when size, anatomy, and energy requirements are taken into account.",Review,Scopus

But contact with a dancing bee is much more effective. When two groups of bees from the same colony have visited two scentless feeding places one of which is close to the hive and the other further away, and one place is resupplied with food after a break in feeding at both, the contact with a dancer indicating the accustomed feeding site is much more effective than contact with a strange dancer indicating the unfamiliar location. The same can be observed if the two places are at equal distance but lie at 100 ° to each other. Under natural conditions foraging groups of the same colony usually exploit food sources with different scents simultaneously.

Light intensity required for the first and the last collecting flight is increased by a factor of 2 (bees with one blinded ocellus), 3.3 (bees with two blinded ocelli), and 4.5 (bees with three blinded ocelli). 8. If food of a lower concentration is offered, bees with blinded ocelli, like normal bees, cease foraging earlier in the evening. 9. The frequency of collecting flights does not differ throughout the day between normal and ocelli-blinded bees, not even during the last hour of foraging. There is no difference between the two groups either, whether bees are collecting at a nearby food-table (50 m) or at one far away (660 m, 1000 m). 10. There are no differences between the flights speed of normal and ocelli-blinded bees either for flights to the food-table or for flights back to the hive. Sidewind, headwind, and tailwind are compensated in the same way by the two groups. 11. The frequencies of dance (wagging runs/15 sec.) do not differ between normal and ocelli-blinded bees. 12. Within a range of 0.96-9845 Lux the speed of phototactic runs towards a light with a different absolute intensity does not differ between normal and ocelli-blinded bees. 13. For a phototactic run bees had to choose one of two lights differing slightly in intensity. Below 1 Lux, bees with three blinded ocelli run to the brighter light if it has an eightfold higher intensity than the darker light (0.8↔0.1 Lux). Normal bees need only twofold (0.2↔ 0.1 Lux), bees with one blinded ocellus fourfold (0.4↔0.1 Lux), and bees with two blinded ocelli sixfold difference (0.6↔0.1 Lux) to get significant results. In ranges of higher intensities (> 1 Lux) the differences required for each test are smaller for all groups. 14. The threshold required for a phototactic run is, in normal bees, less than 0.03 Lux, in bees with three blinded ocelli 0.1 Lux. In bees with one and two blinded ocelli the threshold is between these intensities. 15. There is no relationship between perception of absolute light intensity (or its change) by the ocelli and its use as a trigger for a timetraining. Ocelli-blinded bees trained for a specific feeding time came with the same temporal deviation as normal bees to the food-table. © 1965 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

Observations of the results of 1,000 aggressive interactions for each of eight species of hermit crabs were carried out. These data were used to determine the distribution of acts by one crab following the execution of each act by a second crab. These distributions were compared with the overall distribution of patterns following all acts. 2. 2. Most of the behaviour patterns were found to have some communicatory value, i.e. elicited some change in the behaviour of a recipient crab, although the amount of change varied considerably for different acts. 3. 3. These acts statistically tended to inhibit the execution of some acts and/or be directive toward the occurrence of other acts. 4. 4. Analysis of three-act sequence patterns showed that there can be a second-order probability effect in determining what behaviour pattern will follow a given behavioural act. 5. 5. Certain acts were found to be particularly auto-directive; feeding movements by one crab tended to be followed by feeding movements by the other crab, a double cheliped extension tended to be followed by a d.c.e. by the other crab. 6. 6. The average amount of information transferred per display was calculated for each species. This ranged from 0·35 bits per display in the highly gregarious species Clibanarius tricolor to 0·52 bits per display in Pagurus marshi, individuals of which tend to be camouflaged by accumulated detritus material. The average for the eight species was 0·41 bits/display. 7. 7. The rate of information transmission was calculated for each species. The overall range was from 0·4 to 1·0 bits per second for Paguristes grayi to 0·9 to 4·4 bits per second for Pagurus bonairensis. The total range for these crabs (0·4 to 4·4 bits/second) is slightly higher but of the same order of magnitude as the rates calculated for the honey bee waggle dance and fire ant odour trial. © 1965.",Article,Scopus

Experiments were carried out during 3 years with 4 different colonies of the race Apis mellifica carnica. 62000 data of dances and the corresponding conditions in the environment of the bees during flight, at the artificial feeding places and in the hive were recorded. The direction of flight was both to the north-east and to the south-west; the distances between the hive and the food varied from 385 m up to 1250 m. Equipment suitable to heat the observation hive and to determine its internal temperature is described on p. 13. The following results were shown to be statistically significant: 1. The frequency of the waggle-dance is closely connected with the ""weather phase"", a comprehensive estimation of the meteorological conditions. Dances in phase 3 (i.e. exceeded fair weather) are accelerated, whereas in phase 5 and 6 (weather change accomplished and beginning stabilization) they are retarded. 2. The frequency shows an annual rhythm, characterized by high values during hot weather in summer and lower values in the beginning and by the end of the annual foraging period. Deviations in the annual course may be attributed to short-termed fluctuations of the outside temperature. Peculiar weather conditions, such as ""Schafskälte"" or Indian summer, are expressed in the dances of the bees. Equations of the regression of temperature on frequency are given on p. 37. 3. In contrast to the annual rhythm of frequency, the diurnal curve is in many cases characterized by unaccountable oscillations. The latter are unconnected to the changes of weather elements and are variable in the different seasons. However, the rate of waggle-dances is always slowed down in the evening. A remarkable parallelism was also recorded between the internal temperature of the dance floor and the course of frequency of the bees. Attempts to analyse the complex effect of weather conditions in order to single out those factors which may be responsible for the variability of the dances and to eliminate those which are of no importance led to the following results: 4. Neither the absolute intensity of global radiation nor the rate of its attenuation due to haze or cloudiness can be related with the data on the dances. 5. The frequency is clearly correlated with the temperature outside the hive. Waggle-dances are faster (i.e. more wagging lines per unit of time) after a flight in high temperature than in cold weather. The increase of frequency is, however, not linear, but steeper at lower and flatter at higher temperatures. The change of the frequency seems to be independent of the duration of the temperature influence at all flight distances examined. It amounts to an average of 0,3-0,4 turns per 15 seconds as temperature rises by 10° C. Thus, the temperature coefficient (Q10) is surprisingly low, 1,15 being the maximum value. Neither for Q10 nor for μ, i.e. the thermal activation energy could any constancy be observed in the entire range of temperatures. A logarithmic equation of the form f=0,7 log (TA-12)-4,4 log d + 17,2 allows to compute the frequency of waggle-dance f at different external temperatures TA (° C) and distances of the food source d (m). 6. There is also a clear connexion between the temperature inside the hive and the rhythm of dances. The number of turns per unit of time increases, if the temperature on the comb is raised. However, if overheating is continued for a long time, the top frequencies seem to be adaptively lowered. Regarding the entire interval examined, inside and outside temperatures are of about the same effect on the dances. 7. If the temperature of the food is altered independant of radiation and air temperature by offering sugar water warmed from 25 to 35° C, the dances are accelerated by 0,1 turns per 15 seconds. If, on the other hand, a cold solution is fed, the frequency is below normal. 8. Some of the variability of the dances may be ascribed to fluctuations of atmospheric humidity. The information of the bees is influenced by moisture in different ways depending on the external temperature at the same time. There is no traceable effect of humidity on frequency in cool weather. At temperatures above 25° C, the frequency of the dances rises as humidity decreases. (Hence the dances are carried on at a slower pace in sultry weather.) No evidence could be found that rainfall has any influence upon the rhythm of dances, provided that foraging continues. 9. The absolute level of atmospheric pressure is of no influence on the dances. However, increasing air pressure leads to a slight acceleration of dancing, indicating that it is the barometric tendency which is of importance. 10. There is a close relation between the rate of the wagging lines in the dance and the vector of wind velocity in direction to the feeding place. The frequency varies depending on wind direction in the following way: Flight to the food source with tail wind increases, head-wind lowers the frequency. The values for cross-wind stand on medium level, no matter whether the bee is displaced to its left or its right. No special stimulation by ""Föhn"" (this is a characteristic ""fall down"" wind) could be detected. When it is calm, the frequency of dances is higher than after a flight in side-wind; but it is slower than in tail wind. Vigorous air currents intensify these effects: The correlation between wind velocity and dancing rhythm is negative if the bees fly out against the wind, and positive if the blow gets behind the bees on their way to the feeding place. The frequency differs by 0,2 turns per 15 seconds if the bee is hit by an air current of 2 m per second blowing directly from behind or from the front. Judged from the extent of the rate change of dancing, the external temperature was the weightiest of the factors examined, though even here the effects are small. If analysed separately, the information of individual forager bees is in full accordance with the results stated above. As the ""frequency rules"" did not change after disturbing factors had been eliminated, it is assumed, that there is not only a correlation but a true causality. There are individual differences between the bees due to age and temperament. These are always superimposed upon the changes of frequency as a consequence of varying external conditions. It is not necessary to assume further environmental influences to account for the remaining deviations. The differences between the messages of one individual bee, delivered after two successive flights, are of the same extent as the variation between several phases of the same dance. There are without doubt some personal errors in the observation, but those are by no means of great value compared with the real fluctuations of frequency as recorded. © 1964 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus

When marked honeybee colonies were placed in the middle of a large, relatively uniform field of alfalfa in which the resident honeybee population was light, the number of bees foraging at various distances from the apiary dropped sharply beyond 400 metres and became very small at 600 m. and beyond (Table 1). Subsequently, when the number of colonies throughout the field was increased successively to 2½, 5 and 7½per hectare, the density of bees foraging from the original colonies (which were in the middle of the field) dropped sharply beyond 100 m. and became quite small beyond 200 m. (Fig. 3).2. When colonies of marked (cordovan) bees were placed in a similar field already well populated by unmarked bees from colonies distributed throughout at the rate of 5 per hectare, the marked foragers dispersed in much the same way as when their colonies were placed in the field first (Fig. 5). 3. Competing foragers from colonies in a neighbouring field tended to keep bees away from the side of the experimental field closest to the neighbouring one. Marked bees from colonies brought last to a field foraged in those parts of the field where the resident population offered the least competition. Supplementary ecological observations showed that this resident forager population was low where the forage was less attractive (Fig. 4). 4. The total population density of foragers in the experimental alfalfa fields increased with each increment in the colony density only up to a level which the conditions in the field were able to support. In the locations described, 5 colonies per hectare (2 per acre) properly distributed appeared to provide the maximum population density of foragers (Table 2). © 1963 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus

A pulsed sound of approximately 200 cps. which is produced during the straight run of the honey bee waggle dance is described. The presence of this sound provides a new possibility for explaining the method whereby information about the distance of the food source from the hive is communicated among bees. Besides the elements considered by von Frisch & Jander (1957), sound production time during the straight run and number of pulses present in the straight run are each shown to be also capable of carrying distance information. Since the ratio of the sound pulse rate to waggle rate is approximately 2·5 to 1, the sound is not an incidental result of waggling of the abdomen by the dancing bee. 2. 2. The complete run time, straight run sound production time, and number of sound pulses were all graphically found to be more closely related to the distance of the food source from the hive than the circle run time. These three remaining components were not found to be significantly different from each other on the basis of raw data. 3. 3. The results of a variation analysis of complete run time, straight run time, and circle run time indicate that variability of the complete run time can largely be attributed to variability of the circle run time. 4. 4. The effect of wind is greater on the straight run time than on either complete run time or circle run time. Also, that variability in the complete run time which is due to an effect of wind can largely be attributed to the effect of wind on the straight run time. This information, together with that from 3 (above), shows that the average complete run time is mainly a sum of average circle run time and average straight run time and probably does not transmit distance information in its own right. Since the average complete run time of this study must be equivalent to the average complete run time of the study of von Frisch & Jander, the complete run time of their study can also be eliminated as a possibility for transmitting distance information. 5. 5. The straight run time and number of sound pulses present in the straight run were found to be inseparable on the basis of available data. Either of these two components was found to be a better possibility for transmitting distance information than any of the other components of the dance which were covered in this study. Neither of these two components can be directly compared to the straight run waggle time or number of waggles produced during the straight run (von Frisch & Jander, 1957). Such a comparison must await further experimentation. 6. 6. The following four components (or a combination of any of these four) of the honey bee waggle dance now remain as best possibilities for conveying the information about distance of the food source from the hive: 6.1. (a) time of waggling during the straight run. 6.2. (b) number of waggles produced during the straight run. 6.3. (c) time of sound production during the straight run. 6.4. (d) number of sound pulses produced during the straight run. 7. 7. Analysis of wind effects reveals that bees signal the flight time out to the food source, not the flight time of the return trip. 8. 8. The sound pulse rate did not vary appreciably with temperature. Although the sound pulse rate did vary with distance, the amount of change was slight and the significance was marginal. 9. 9. The interpretation of the results of the step-experiments (Stüfenversuchen) of von Frisch and co-workers is questionable, since a performance much poorer than that given by the standard deviation of the results, coupled with bees visiting more than one of the unevenly spaced stations, would give similar results. 10. 10. The possible use of sound by honey bees in communicating information about the distance of a food source from the hive is discussed. © 1962.",Article,Scopus

The trails consist of broken streaks of invisible quantities of secretion. They do not contain any elements of intrinsic polarization perceptible to follower ants. Individual trails convey information on the position of food finds but not on their quality. The respective accuracies of laying and response do not appear to differ on various substrates. An innate tendency of follower workers to tuen back on the trails beyond 5 to 10 centimetres from the nest is described. The information content of the individual odour trail is compared with that of a radically different communication form, the waggle dance of the honeybee. The two messages transmit similar quantities of information, which can be roughly approximated as follows: 3 to 5 bits for direction and 2 for distance (the equivalent of employing, accurately, an 8 to 32 point compass and 4-interval distance scale). The quantity of direction information is a function of distance of target in the fire ant but apparently not in the honeybee. The source entropy of the initial messages, apart from transmission, and the transmission rates are also calculated. © 1962.",Article,Scopus
