Such development threatens the integrity of coastal ecosystems. Coastal dune systems contain unique sets of terrestrial invertebrates and native plants, and represent some of the last remaining areas of semi-natural habitats along the coasts. In our study, we monitored bee and flowering plant abundance and diversity within coastal dune systems located within protected lands and developed sites throughout South and Central Florida. Our aim was to assess the potential impacts dune degradation and development could have on these economically and ecologically important insects. A total of 5419 bees from 5 families and 56 taxa were captured using bowl traps. Halictidae accounted for 70% of all bees collected, followed by Apidae (28%), Megachilidae (2%), Andrenidae (0.1%) and Colletidae (0.07%). Both species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices were higher in protected lands when compared with developed sites. A majority of the commonly collected bee species showed higher abundances in protected lands compared with developed sites. Protected lands also supported higher abundances of ground, wood, and tunnel-nesting bees when compared with developed sites. Bee species richness and Shannon-Wiener indices were lower in sites with greater percentages of development occurring within close proximity to the dune systems, and higher in sites with greater availability of dune coverage. We observed higher abundance and flowering plant species richness within protected lands when compared with developed sites; protected lands also supported more federally endangered/threatened or state protected plant species compared with developed sites. Overall, coastal dune systems are ecologically important bee sanctuaries and should be conserved to help sustain native bee communities and the flowering plants that occur within them.

At first a direct relationship between the inverse of the milling time and the power of the planetary mill was established, which allows the validation of theoretical models proposed in the literature for the energy transfer in milling devices and the comparison of milling equipment efficiencies. Afterwards based on the obtained relation, eight design parameters in milling, namely, number of balls, ball diameter, vial radius, vial height, ball diameter distribution coefficient, plate spinning rate, vial spinning rate and distance between the center of the plate and the center of the vial were optimized. For evaluating the optimized parameters and their practical effectiveness, a case study was conducted. Result showed that by applying the optimal parameters instead of experimental (non-optimized) ones, a route with less time was obtained for the production of nanostructured powders in planetary mills. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","the use of artificial bee colony algorithm to speed up","The purpose of the present paper is to use artificial"

To describe the colonization process of a remote oceanic island, I investigated the flora, vegetation, and pollinators of Nishino-shima Island 31 yr after a major eruption in 1973. Nishino-shima Island, which is 22 ha in size, is located 1,000 kin south of mainland Japan. Vegetation cover had increased, especially on new lowland area, since a preliminary survey done 10 yr after the eruption, but plant species richness remained poor (only six species). Thus, the plant colonization rate (0.10 species/yr) was far slower than that of other volcanic islands such as Krakatau. Most plants (four species) had ocean-dispersed seeds, but two species were likely dispersed via attachment to seabirds. Despite colonization by only a few plant species, there were abundant flower visitors including ants, bugs, a butterfly, and a fly (but no bee species), and the average visitation rate per flower was 5.5 visits/12 hr in total observations. Most of the insects used multiple food sources, concurrently acting as scavengers or herbivores.","colonization of nishino-shima island by plants and arthropods 31 years","Although many researchers have studied colonization, the process has rarely"

While its contribution to economic development and watershed protection is increasingly recognized its cultural significance is however, seldom noticed. This study was conducted using an ethnobotanical study approach to document the honey bee flora and associated indigenous knowledge of local communities in Borena Sayint National Park (BSNP), north eastern Ethiopia. Methods: Data were collected from 170 informants through semi-structured interviews and guided field walks, focus group discussion with 37 informants and 14 key informants and analyzed using standard analytical tools including ranking, comparisons and multivariate analyses. Results: In total, 152 bee forage species in 133 genera and 74 families were documented. The Asteraceae and Rosaceae were represented with six species each over the other plant families. Percentage of mentions per species ranged between 76.9 and 13.5 % for the most salient bee forage species. Dombeya torrida, Erica arborea, and Olinia rochetiana captured high community consensus as measured by rank order of popularity and designated as local appellation names of honey. Cluster analysis of priority ranking data showed relationships between key informants with respect to preferences, but ordination analysis did not indicate environmental proximity as a determinant of their responses. Five honey harvesting seasons occur each corresponding to the floral calendar of a dominant bee forage species that stipulate relocation of hives to appropriate locations within the national park. Conclusion: The apicultural tradition is iconic with economic value and forming part of the local peoples' cultural identity apt to be preserved as a bequest for posterity.","an iconic traditional apiculture of park fringe communities of borena","Background: Traditional apiculture has been practised in Ethiopia over a"

The differences between species are related to the range of blooming periods (in days), the number of inflorescences at maximum bloom, and the time of peak bloom. More than 93% of the time individual bumblebees continued to forage on the same Pedicularis species as was previously visited; yet when switches in the diet of the bees occurred, they were more likely to be to another species of Pedicularis. Although individuals of other genera were in bloom, the bees switched to the Pedicularis species most synchronous in time and space to the previously preferred Pedicularis species. The last species to flower had the greatest reward but also had the largest ratio of the number of pollen grains to the number of ovules compared with the previously flowering Pedicularis species.

Apis mellifera L., honey bees, generally are assumed to provide the majority of crop pollination, with the value of pollination provided by non-Apis bees estimated at between one-half and one-sixth the value of honey bees, though many non-Apis bees are known to be more effective in pollinating some crops. In this study, the first documenting wild bees visiting crop flowers through the growing season, non-Apis bees accounted for the majority of crop visitation for several economically important entomophilous crops in Virginia, such as apple, blueberry, caneberry, and cucurbit) and likely provided most of the pollination. Wild bees made up between 68% (in caneberries) and 83% (in cucurbits) of bees visiting crop flowers. Between 43 and 59 non-Apis bee species visited flowers of each crop (105 species overall). Species turnover was very high between sites, ranging from only 13% shared species in pairwise comparisons for blueberries to 30% shared species for caneberries. Native bee taxa most abundant on crops were Andrena F., mining bees, Bombus Latreille, bumble bees, and Osmia Panzer, mason bees, on apples and blueberries; Lasioglossum Curtis, sweat bees, on caneberries; and Peponapis pruinosa Say, squash bees, and Bombus on cucurbits. Overall, this study highlights the substantial role of native bees in agricultural pollination in this region.","from april to august-wild bees pollinating crops through the growing","Few baseline data exist regarding the role of wild, primarily"

Here, we use plant-pollinator interaction network metrics to assess the effect of elevation on flowers and flower-visiting insect assemblages on a sentinel mountain used for monitoring climate change in the flower-and insect-rich Cape Floristic Region. We also use these interaction metrics to explain the effect of environmental factors on the interaction networks. We did this over four vegetation zones <1640m asl, as determined by former botanical studies. Overall, bees were the dominant flower visitors, followed by monkey beetles, and far behind were wasps and flies. The middle elevation zone (650-744 m a.s.l), which is also an ecotone between two distinct botanical zones, had the highest species richness and abundance of interacting plants and insects. Interaction frequency and size of network were also greatest in the middle zone, as were network diversity, generality, and linkage density, while lowest in the peak zone. In sum, there was distinct elevation zoning of flower-visiting insects. The greatest zonal change was between species at the middle compared with peak zone. Large-sized monkey beetles, bees and flies characterized the unique assemblage in the peak zone (1576-1640 m a.s.l.). The insect zonation tracked that of plant assemblages, with air temperature (lapse rate) being the primary driver of bee distribution, with lowest levels in the peak zone. In contrast, beetle distribution was driven mostly by flower assemblages as well as air temperature. In turn, wasp and fly interaction networks were not affected by any of the measured environmental variables. We conclude that increased elevation stress from reduced temperatures, changing abiotic weather conditions (e.g. strong winds at high elevations), and decline in flowering plant composition causes breakdown of interaction networks involving bees and beetles but not that of flies and wasps.","insect-flower interaction networks vary among endemic pollinator taxa over an","Interaction networks are sensitive to elevation gradients through changes in"

Thus far, most research assessing the combined effects of farming systems and landscape complexity on beneficial insects has been conducted in relatively diversified and mesic systems and may not represent the large-scale, monoculture-based dryland agriculture that dominates many regions worldwide. Specifically, the effects of farming systems on forbs, bees, and their interactions are poorly understood in highly simplified dryland landscapes such as those in the Northern Great Plains, United States, an area globally important for conventional and organic small grain, pulse, forage, and oilseed production. During a 3-yr (2013-2015) study, we assessed 1) the effects of dryland no-till conventional and tilled organic farming on forbs, bees, and bee- flower networks and 2) the relationship between natural habitat and bee abundance. Flower density and richness were greater in tilled organic fields than in no-till conventional fields, and forb community composition differed between farming systems. We observed high bee diversity (109 taxa) in this highly simplified landscape, and bee abundance, richness, and community composition were similar between systems. Compared with tilled organic fields, bee-flower interactions in no-till conventional fields were poorly connected, suggesting these systems maintain relatively impoverished plant-pollinator networks. Natural habitat (11% of the landscape) did not affect small-bodied bee abundance in either farming system but positively affected large-bodied bees within 2,000 m of crop-field centers. In highly simplified agricultural landscapes, dryland organic farming and no-till conventional farming together support relatively high bee diversity, presumably because dryland organic farming enhances floral resources and bee-flower networks, and no-till management in conventional farming provides undisturbed ground-nesting habitats for wild bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea).","dryland organic farming partially offsets negative effects of highly simplified","Industrialized farming practices result in simplified agricultural landscapes, reduced biodiversity,"

The Northern Great Plains is a key region for small grain, forage, pulse, and oilseed production, yet the impact of available floral resources on colony success of eusocial bees is unknown. To assess the effects of farming system on bee colony success (relative growth rate and fecundity) and worker condition (lipid content and wing wear), we placed 60 mini-colonies of Bombus impatiens in six conventional and six organic spring wheat fields near Big Sandy, Montana, USA over two growing seasons. Consistent with our expectations, we found that flower density and forb richness were positively associated with colony relative growth rate and fecundity. Similarly, flower density, forb richness, and the relative growth rate and fecundity of B. impatiens colonies were greater in organic fields when compared to conventional fields. Workers from organic fields had lower mean wing wear and marginally greater average body lipid content. However, there were no differences in the number of reproductives (queens, workers, and males) between two systems. Lastly, though the overall composition of colony-collected pollen was not different across the farming systems, colony-collected pollen species richness was greater in organic fields in one of the two sampled growing seasons. We conclude that by increasing B. impatiens colony success and individual worker condition, the greater floral resources observed in organic systems can contribute to better biodiversity-based indirect ecosystem services in the highly simplified agricultural landscapes that dominates the Northern Great Plains.","dryland organic farming increases floral resources and bee colony success","Agricultural intensification has contributed to declines in wild bee populations"

For nectar, which consists mainly of sugars, profitability is usually defined by its energetic value. Nectars, however, also contain a wide range of trace components, some of which affect their attractiveness. Honeybees produce honey from nectar. We compared the round dance and trophallaxis behaviours of bees foraging on avocado and citrus honey solutions, as a substitute for nectars. These sources differ in their trace-elements composition, with avocado nectar and honey containing higher concentrations of minerals than citrus nectar and honey. In a second experiment, we compared the behaviour of bees foraging on sucrose solution and sucrose solution enriched with four major mineral components of avocado nectar. Subjects foraging on avocado honey had a significantly lower probability of dancing than those foraging on citrus honey, a rate of direction reversals that was almost one half, a lower total number of reversals, shorter dance duration and longer trophallaxis time. When avocado honey was supplied to bees that previously fed on citrus honey, most of them avoided it, indicating a strong context effect. When foraging on mineral-enriched sugar solution, dance variables tended to be lower compared with sucrose solution without minerals, but differences were smaller than the differences between the honey solutions. These results show that nectar trace components affect the estimation of nectar profitability by bees and consequently recruitment of new foragers to nectar sources. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","honeybee, apis mellifera, round dance is influenced by trace components","The round dance and mutual feeding (trophallaxis) enable honeybees to"

The aim of the current study is to investigate how the species in this guild distribute their foraging effort, and the range in their niche overlap levels. Our hypothesis is that niche overlap levels are strongly affected by the exploitation of some key plants, those profitable and locally abundant oil-plants. The bees were sampled for six months, during their visits to the flowers in a savannah (Cerrado). These oil-bee species explored the floral resources provided by 13 plant species. The trophic niche of the most abundant species, Centris aenea Lepeletier, was relatively narrow, similarly to those of Epicharis species. Low overlap of trophic niches (TrNO<30%) was most commonly found. The distribution of bee visits to the host plants revealed redundancy in the floral resource exploitation. However, the foraging concentration levels in some key plants were different for distinct oil-bee species, and it contributed to the low overlap of niches between many pairs of species.","exploitation of floral resources and niche overlap within an oil-collecting","Oil bees exploit host plants for resources to feed the"

Both the distance and direction of the food source were communicated very accurately in T. corvina. In P. tica and T. angustula the direction of the food source was communicated. In the distance experiments with P. tica, newcomers arrived mostly at the food source nearest to the nest. Only when the control feeder had a different odor than the experimental feeder did most recruits find the experimental feeder.

Jumping spiders (Araneae: Salticidae) are characterized by their highly acute vision, which mediates many behaviors, including prey capture and navigation. When moving to a specific goal (prey, nest, a potential mate, etc.), salticids rely on visual cues and spatial memory to orient in 3-dimensional space. Salticid spatial ability has been studied in homing and detour tasks, with Portia being considered one of the most skillful genera in terms of spatial ability in the family. Commonly living in complex environments, salticids are likely to encounter a wide variety of routes that could lead to a goal, and, as selection favors individuals that can accurately make assessments, they may be able to assess alternative route distances to select the most efficient route. Here, we tested whether 2 salticid species (Portia fimbriata and Trite planiceps) can discriminate and assess between different available routes by their length, and riskiness to escape from a stressful scenario. Results suggest that while Portia is more likely to choose the easiest and shortest escape routes, Trite is faster in both decision making about which route to take, and to escape. However, some individuals were able to use novel shortcuts instead of the routes expected, with Portia containing a higher proportion of shortcut-takers than Trite. These differences in spatial ability seem to correspond with the environmental complexity inhabited by each species.","risk assessment and the use of novel shortcuts in spatial","Selection on individuals that incorporate risk to quickly and accurately"

Species respond to such environmental modifications by adapting to new conditions or by shifting their geographic distributions towards more suitable areas. The latter might be constrained by species' functional traits that influence their ability to move, reproduce or establish. Here, we show that functional traits related to dispersal, reproduction, habitat use and diet have influenced how three pollinator groups (bees, butterflies and hoverflies) responded to changes in climate and land-use in the Netherlands since 1950. Across the three pollinator groups, we found pronounced areal range expansions (>53%) and modelled range shifts towards the north (all taxa: 17-22 km), west (bees: 14 km) and east (butterflies: 11 km). The importance of specific functional traits for explaining distributional changes varied among pollinator groups.

Bats display remarkable navigation capabilities, ranging from nightly commutes of several kilometers and up to seasonal migrations over thousands of kilometers [5]. Many bats have been suggested to fly along fixed routes termed ""flyways,'' when flying from their roost to their foraging sites [6]. Flyways commonly stretch along linear landscape elements such as tree lines, hedges, or rivers [7]. When flying along a flyway, bats must estimate the distance they have traveled in order to determine when to turn. This can be especially challenging when moving along a repetitive landscape. Some bats, like Kuhl's pipistrelles, which we studied here, have limited vision [8] and were suggested to rely on bio-sonar for navigation. These bats could therefore estimate distance using three main sensory-navigation strategies, all of which we have examined: acoustic flow, acoustic landmarks, or path integration. We trained bats to fly along a linear flyway and land on a platform. We then tested their behavior when the platform was removed under different manipulations, including changing the acoustic flow, moving the start point, and adding wind. We found that bats do not require acoustic flow, which was hypothesized to be important for their navigation [9-15], and that they can perform the task without landmarks. Our results suggest that Kuhl's pipistrelles use internal self-motion cues-also known as path integration-rather than external information to estimate flight distance for at least dozens of meters when navigating along linear flyways.","bats use path integration rather than acoustic flow to assess","Navigation can be achieved using different strategies from simple beaconing"

Field margins can serve as nesting and foraging habitats for wild bees and can be a source of pollinators. Regional differences in pollinator community composition may affect this spill-over of bees. We studied how regional and local differences affect the spatial distribution of wild bee species richness, activity-density and body size in crop fields. We sampled bees both from the field centre and at two different types of semi-natural field margins, grass strips and hedges, in 12 strawberry fields. The fields were distributed over four regions in Northern Europe, representing an almost 1100 km long north-south gradient. Even over this gradient, daytime temperatures during sampling did not differ significantly between regions and did therefore probably not impact bee activity. Bee species richness was higher in field margins compared with field centres independent of field size. However, there was no difference between centre and margin in body-size or activity-density. In contrast, bee activity-density increased towards the southern regions, whereas the mean body size increased towards the north. In conclusion, our study revealed a general pattern across European regions of bee diversity, but not activity-density, declining towards the field interior which suggests that the benefits of functional diversity of pollinators may be difficult to achieve through spillover effects from margins to crop. We also identified dissimilar regional patterns in bee diversity and activity-density, which should be taken into account in conservation management.","pollinator communities in strawberry crops - variation at multiple spatial","Predicting potential pollination services of wild bees in crops requires"

The main cause of the decline is believed to be habitat destruction and fragmentation associated with urbanization and agricultural intensification. Urbanization is a process that involves dramatic and persistent changes of the landscape, increasing the amount of built-up areas while decreasing the amount of green areas. However, urban green areas can also provide suitable alternative habitats for wild bees. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied bumble bees in allotment gardens, i.e. intensively managed flower rich green areas, along a gradient of urbanization from the inner city of Stockholm towards more rural (periurban) areas. Keeping habitat quality similar along the urbanization gradient allowed us to separate the effect of landscape change (e.g. proportion impervious surface) from variation in habitat quality. Bumble bee diversity (after rarefaction to 25 individuals) decreased with increasing urbanization, from around eight species on sites in more rural areas to between five and six species in urban allotment gardens. Bumble bee abundance and species composition were most affected by qualities related to the management of the allotment areas, such as local flower abundance. The variability in bumble bee visits between allotment gardens was higher in an urban than in a periurban context, particularly among small and long-tongued bumble bee species. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that allotment gardens and other urban green areas can serve as important alternatives to natural habitats for many bumble bee species, but that the surrounding urban landscape influences how many species that will be present. The higher variability in abundance of certain species in the most urban areas may indicate a weaker reliability of the ecosystem service pollination in areas strongly influenced by human activity.","bumble bees (bombus spp) along a gradient of increasing urbanization","Background: Bumble bees and other wild bees are important pollinators"

It has been further proposed that the orientation of the body axis on the vertical comb is detected by neck hairs (NHs) on the prosternal organ.

There are two specialized sensors along the wing margin for detecting the airborne vibration caused by wingbeats. The response properties of these sensors suggest that each sensor plays a different role in the control of wingbeats. The second example is Johnston's organ that contributes to regulating flying speed and perceiving vector information about food sources to hive-mates.

In the next step of fabrication, building compact models and developing parameter extraction methods have critical importance in designing electronic circuits using fabricated OFETs. In this paper, we propose a parameter extraction approach which benefits from the power of metaheuristics. Although direct extraction tools offer analytical solutions in successive steps to extract model parameters, metaheuristics-based global optimization methods can find all parameters at once by exploring a wide range of parameters. Direct extraction tools are cumbersome and need human expertise. On the other hand, global optimization methods are very flexible, adaptive and can be automated as parameter extraction tools of any compact model. In this study, we introduce three different global optimization algorithms, namely, a genetic algorithm (GA), a hybrid artificial bee colony (h-ABC) algorithm, and bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) algorithm, for the parameter extraction. To the best of our knowledge, h-ABC and BFO algorithms have been used for the first time in extracting parameters of OFET compact models. We use two OFET compact models developed by Estrada et al. and Marinov et al. for two different datasets of OFET transistors, both having pentacene as organic semiconductor. While one of the dataset of transistor (T1) is available in literature, the dataset of the other transistor fabricated in our laboratory (T2) is generated as a new dataset. In order to tune control parameters of the developed algorithms, Taguchi's orthogonal experimental design (OED) method is used. Experimental results show that the proposed metaheuristics-based approach can extract model parameters successfully and can perform better than direct extraction methods. The studied OFET compact models fit to the experimental data with these parameters and predict similar output characteristic curves. The algorithms show a good agreement with the experimental data of T1 and T2, having normalized root-mean-square error values under 3.70%, and 8.74% for the models of Estrada et al. and Marinov et al., respectively. It is shown that h-ABC and BFO algorithms perform better than GA on average.

The aim of this study is to investigate how the characteristics of waggle dances for natural food sources and environmental factors affect dance follower behaviour. Because food source profitability tends to decrease with increasing foraging distance, we hypothesised that the attractiveness of a dance, measured as the number of dance followers and their attendance, decreases with increasing distance to the advertised food location. Additionally, we determined whether time of year and dance signal noise, quantified as the variation in waggle run direction and duration, affect dance follower behaviour. Our results suggest that bees follow fewer waggle runs as the food source distance increases, but that they invest more time in following each dance. This is because waggle run duration increases with increasing foraging distance. Followers responded to increased angular noise in dances indicating more distant food sources by following more waggle runs per dance than when angular noise was low. The number of dance followers per dancing bee was also affected by the time of year and varied among colonies. Our results provide evidence that both noise in the message, that is variation in the direction component, and the message itself, that is the distance of the advertised food location, affect dance following.

The aim of this study was to investigate how the previous experience of honeybee foragers at a feeding location affects their persistence at that location once food is no longer available. We hypothesised that persistence would be greater to locations that were more rewarding (closer to the hive, higher concentration of sucrose solution), for which a bee had greater prior experience (0.5-h vs. 2-h training access), and at times of the year of lower nectar availability in the environment. We studied individually marked worker bees from four colonies trained to sucrose-solution feeders. Our results support most of these predictions. Persistence, measured both in duration and number of visits, was greater to locations that previously offered sucrose solution of higher concentration (2m vs. 1m) or were closer to the hive (20m vs. 450m). Persistence was also greater in bees that had longer access at the feeder before the syrup was terminated (2h vs. 0.5h). However, contrary to our prediction, persistence was not higher in the season of the lowest nectar availability in the environment in the study year. In summary, honeybees show considerable persistence at foraging sites that ceased providing rewards. The decision to abandon a foraging site depends on the profitability the forager experienced when the foraging site was still rewarding.","persistence to unrewarding feeding locations by honeybee foragers (apis mellifera):","Honeybee foragers that find a profitable food source quickly establish"

Consequences may range from reproductive competition to facilitation, but the ecological drivers determining the type and magnitude of such indirect interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the role of the spatial scale of invader presence and spatially contingent behavioural responses of different pollinator groups as potential key drivers, using the invasive Oxalis pes-caprae and the self-incompatible native annual Diplotaxis erucoides as a model system. Three treatments were assigned to native focal plants: (1) invader present at the landscape scale (hectares) but experimentally removed at the floral neighbourhood scale (pa); (2) invader present at both scales (pp); (3) invader absent at both scales (aa). Interestingly, we found pronounced spatially contingent differences in the responses of pollinators: honeybees and bumblebees were strongly attracted into invaded sites at the landscape scale, translating into native plant visitation facilitation through honeybees, while bumblebees almost exclusively visited Oxalis. Non-corbiculate wild bees, in contrast, showed less pronounced responses in foraging behavior, primarily at the floral neighborhood scale. Average heterospecific (Oxalis) pollen deposition onto stigmas of Diplotaxis was low (<1 %), but higher in the pp than in the pa treatment. Hand-pollination of Diplotaxis with Oxalis and conspecific pollen, however, reduced seed set by more than half when compared to hand-pollination with only conspecific pollen. Seed set of Diplotaxis, finally, was increased by 14 % (reproductive facilitation) in the pp treatment, while it was reduced by 27 % (reproductive competition) in the pa treatment compared to uninvaded populations.

Females of Dawson's burrowing bees vary in body weight over a twofold range. Despite the potential for differences in body weight to affect several aspects of the competition among nesting females, no clear advantages were documented for larger females. 2. Nesting females were not consistently larger than emerging females, nor was there a consistent relationship between body size and the weight of pollen and nectar carried to the nest on provisioning trips. At one nesting location, larger females did not produce larger pre-pupal offspring nor did they produce offspring at a faster rate than their smaller nesting companions. 3. In addition, large body size was not associated with greater success in nest defence despite the fact that nesting females regularly encountered intruders in their burrows. Residency, not body size, determined the outcome of almost all contests for control of a nest burrow. The absence of a large body size effect here appears to stem from an intruder strategy designed to enable nest-searching females to acquire burrows that had been abandoned through death or dispersal of their original owners rather than securing existing nests through an aggressive takeover strategy. 4. Thus, although large body size conveys significant fitness advantages to males, this attribute does not promote female success in either provisioning or defending their nests. © 2006 The Authors.","does variation in female body size affect nesting success in","1.

Shifts in the spatial and temporal patterns of flowering could affect the resources available to pollinators, and such shifts might become more common as climate change progresses. 2. As mid-summer temperatures have warmed, we found that a montane meadow ecosystem in the southern Rocky Mountains of the United States exhibits a trend toward a bimodal distribution of flower abundance, characterized by a mid-season reduction in total flower number, instead of a broad, unimodal flowering peak lasting most of the summer season. 3. We examined the shapes of community-level flowering curves in this system and found that the typical unimodal peak results from a pattern of complementary peaks in flowering among three distinct meadow types (dry, mesic and wet) within the larger ecosystem. However, high mid-summer temperatures were associated with divergent shifts in the flowering curves of these individual meadow types. Specifically, warmer summers appeared to cause increasing bimodality in mesic habitats, and a longer interval between early and late flowering peaks in wet and dry habitats. 4. Together, these habitat-specific shifts produced a longer mid-season valley in floral abundance across the larger ecosystem in warmer years. Because of these warming-induced changes in flowering patterns, and the significant increase in summer temperatures in our study area, there has been a trend toward non-normality of flowering curves over the period 1974-2009. This trend reflects increasing bimodality in total community-wide flowering. 5. The resulting longer periods of low flowering abundance in the middle of the summer season could negatively affect pollinators that are active throughout the season, and shifts in flowering peaks within habitats might create mismatches between floral resources and demand by pollinators with limited foraging ranges. 6. Synthesis. Early-season climate conditions are getting warmer and drier in the high altitudes of the southern Rocky Mountains. We present evidence that this climate change is disrupting flowering phenology within and among different moisture habitats in a sub-alpine meadow ecosystem, causing a mid-season decline in floral resources that might negatively affect mutualists, especially pollinators. Our findings suggest that climate change can have complex effects on phenology at small spatial scales, depending on patch-level habitat differences.","emergence of a mid-season period of low floral resources in","1.

We first explored whether bumblebees can learn a nonnatural object manipulation task by using string pulling to access a reward that was presented out of reach. Only a small minority “innovated” and solved the task spontaneously, but most bees were able to learn to pull a string when trained in a stepwise manner. In addition, naïve bees learnt the task by observing a trained demonstrator from a distance. Learning the behavior relied on a combination of simple associative mechanisms and trial-and-error learning and did not require “insight”: naïve bees failed a “coiled-string experiment,” in which they did not receive instant visual feedback of the target moving closer when tugging on the string. In cultural diffusion experiments, the skill spread rapidly from a single knowledgeable individual to the majority of a colony’s foragers. We observed that there were several sequential sets (“generations”) of learners, so that previously naïve observers could first acquire the technique by interacting with skilled individuals and, subsequently, themselves become demonstrators for the next “generation” of learners, so that the longevity of the skill in the population could outlast the lives of informed foragers. This suggests that, so long as animals have a basic toolkit of associative and motor learning processes, the key ingredients for the cultural spread of unusual skills are already in place and do not require sophisticated cognition. © 2016 Alem et al.","associative mechanisms allow for social learning and cultural transmission of","Social insects make elaborate use of simple mechanisms to achieve"

A widely accepted yet untested hypothesis states that flowers serve as bridges in the transmission of viruses between bees. Here, using a series of controlled experiments with captive bee colonies, we examined the role of flowers in bee virus transmission. We first examined if honey bees deposit viruses on flowers and whether bumble bees become infected after visiting contaminated flowers. We then examined whether plant species differ in their propensity to harbor viruses and if bee visitation rates increase the likelihood of virus deposition on flowers. Our experiment demonstrated, for the first time, that honey bees deposit viruses on flowers. However, the two viruses we examined, black queen cell virus (BQCV) and deformed wing virus (DWV), were not equally distributed across plant species, suggesting that differences in floral traits, virus ecology and/or foraging behavior may mediate the likelihood of deposition. Bumble bees did not become infected after visiting flowers previously visited by honey bees suggesting that transmission via flowers may be a rare occurrence and contingent on multiplicative factors and probabilities such as infectivity of virus strain across bee species, immunocompetence, virus virulence, virus load, and the probability a bumble bee will contact a virus particle on a flower.

Therefore, our objective is the utilization of video-tracking to quantify how the acute oral exposure to different doses (0.1–2 ng/bee) of the neonicotinoid “clothianidin” influences the locomotor activity of honeybees in a time course experiment. The total distance moved, resting time as well as the duration and frequency of bouts of laying upside down are measured. Our results show that bees exposed to acute sublethal doses of clothianidin exhibit a significant increase in the total distance moved after 30 and 60 min of the treatment at the highest dose (2 ng/bee). Nevertheless, a reduction of the total distance is observed at this dose 90 min post-treatment compared to the distance of the same group after 30 min, where the treated bees show an arched abdomen and start to lose their postural control. The treated bees with 1 ng clothianidin show a significant increase in total distance moved over the experimental period. Moreover, a reduction in the resting time and increase of the duration and frequency of bouts of laying upside down at these doses are found. Furthermore, significant effects on the tested parameters are observed at the dose (0.5 ng/bee) first at 60 min post-treatment compared to untreated bees.

Among all major clades of bees, Colletidae has been a prime example of an ancient group whose Gondwanan origin probably precedes the complete break-up of Africa, Antarctica, Australia and South America, because modern lineages of this family occur primarily in southern continents. In this paper, we aim to study the temporal and spatial diversification of colletid bees to better understand the processes that have resulted in the present southern disjunctions. Location Southern continents. Methods We assembled a dataset comprising four nuclear genes of a broad sample of Colletidae. We used Bayesian inference analyses to estimate the phylogenetic tree topology and divergence times. Biogeographical relationships were investigated using event-based analytical methods: a Bayesian approach to dispersal-vicariance analysis, a likelihood-based dispersal-extinctioncladogenesis model and a Bayesian model. We also used lineage through time analyses to explore the tempo of radiations of Colletidae and their context in the biogeographical history of these bees. Results Initial diversification of Colletidae took place at the Late Cretaceous (70 Ma). Several (6-14) lineage exchanges between Australia and South America via Antarctica during the Late Cretaceous and Eocene epochs could explain the disjunctions observed between colletid lineages today. All biogeographical methods consistently indicated that there were multiple lineage exchanges between South America and Australia, and these approaches were valuable in exploring the degree of uncertainty inherent in the ancestral reconstructions. Biogeographical and dating results preclude an explanation of Scrapterinae in Africa as a result of vicariance, so one dispersal event is assumed to explain the disjunction in relation to Euryglossinae. The net diversification rate was found to be highest in the recent history of colletid evolution. Main conclusions The biogeography and macroevolutionary history of colletid bees can be explained by a combination of Cenozoic vicariance and palaeoclimatic changes during the Neogene. The austral connection and posterior break-up of South America, Antarctica and Australia resulted in a pattern of disjunct sister lineages. Increased biome aridification coupled with floristic diversification in the southern continents during the Neogene may have contributed to the high rates of cladogenesis in these bees in the last 25-30 million years.","biogeography and diversification of colletid bees (hymenoptera: colletidae): emerging patterns","Aim The evolutionary history of bees is presumed to extend"

The transmission rate of this disease therefore depends on spore deposition by the vector species and preferences for infected vs. healthy hosts. We observed natural populations of S. alba to document the most abundant insect visitors, which include syrphid flies, andrenid bees, bumblebees and a variety of nocturnal moths. using bumblebees and moths in flower preference studies, we showed that bumblebees preferentially visited healthy flowers, but the strength of this preference declined if the bees had prior exposure to diseased flowers. Nocturnal moths showed less discrimination with respect to disease status when plants were arranged in a field population of S. alba, and preferentially visited plants with more flowers. A laboratory analysis of spore deposition by bumblebees showed that whereas most spores were deposited on the first several flowers visited, flowers beyond the 15th visit may still receive enough spores to produce a new infection. Spore deposition was also influenced by changes in vector behavior associated with spacing in artificial arrays of S. alba plants. Models were fitted to deposition data to compare estimates for spore dispersal rates and the initial number of spores acquired by vectors. This study demonstrated several ways that vector behavior can influence rates of disease spread in natural populations. Preferences for healthy vs. infected hosts can cause disease dispersal to vary from that expected by randomly foraging insect vectors. Changes in visitation behavior associated with host density can affect the magnitude and distance of spore deposition in host populations.","vector behavior and the transmission of anther-smut infection in silene","Anther-smut disease caused by Ustilago violacea is transmitted by insects"

Alternatively, in some species, ICF was replaced by colony fission, in which young queens accompanied by workers found a new colony at walking distance from the mother nest. We compared the queen morphology of Cataglyphis floricola, which disperses by fission, with that of its most likely living ancestor, Cataglyphis emmae, which disperses by ICF. As in other species, the transition from ICF to fission is associated with queen miniaturization. Interestingly, C. floricola presents two types of small queens: brachypters (with short non-functional wings) and ergatoids (worker-like apterous queens). Ergatoids are, on average, 2.8 mg lighter and have half the number of ovarioles than brachypters, which limits the advantage for a colony to produce ergatoids instead of brachypters. Furthermore, more ergatoids are produced than brachypters, but their individual survival rate is lower. During colony fission, 96% of the cocoons containing brachypters but only 31% of those containing ergatoids are transferred to the daughter nests where, after emergence, they compete for becoming the next queen. The remaining queen cocoons, which stay in the mother queen's nest, are eliminated by workers upon emergence, probably to maintain monogyny. This waste of energy suggests that producing ergatoids instead of brachypters is unlikely to increase colony efficiency. We argue that the evolution of ergatoids could derive from a selfish larval strategy, developing into worker-like queens in spite of the colony interest.","the evolution of worker-queen polymorphism in cataglyphis ants: interplay between","In many ants, young queens disperse by flying away from"

The methodology consisted of capturing bees foraging on flowers along transects, though with small differences between surveys. These ""cerrado"" areas have a large number of species of native bees, which are important pollinators in several Brazilian ecosystems. The community of bees varied among these different fragments.

A simple and tractable mathematical model of the honey bee scout-recruit system was developed to study the relationship between nectar availability, the efficiency of the honey bee's recruitment system, and the optimal proportion of scouts that maximizes net gain (benefit - cost), or, energetic efficiency (benefit/cost - 1). The models consider both the energetic costs and benefits of active scouts and recruits as well as the cost of an inactive forager reserve. They predict conditions when individual foraging is favored over the honey bee's recruitment system, when the colony should abandon foraging altogether, and the optimal proportion of scouts (when the scout-recruit system is favored). The models' predictions qualitatively match empirical data. Surprisingly, previous empirical data from the honey bee suggest that recruits' costs are greater than scouts' - recruits spend significantly longer searching for a forage patch than do scouts - thereby causing researchers to rethink how the scout-recruit system might be adaptive. Using average returns, the models demonstrate how the scout-recruit system is adaptive despite these apparent higher recruit costs relative to the scouts'. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the results are robust to a broad range of relative costs of active workers, inactive workers, and the energetic benefits of the forage. Consequently, the model is demonstrated to be relevant to many insect societies that employ a scout-recruit system.","the adaptive value of inactive foragers and the scout-recruit system","In honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies, scouts search for productive"

Social complexity is a broadly used term that encompasses many individual and colony-level traits and characteristics such as colony size, polymorphism and foraging strategy. A number of earlier studies have considered the relationships among various correlates of social complexity in insect societies; in this review, we build upon those studies by proposing additional correlates and show how all correlates can be integrated in a common explanatory framework. The various correlates are divided among four broad categories (sections). Under 'polyphenism' we consider the differences among individuals, in particular focusing upon 'caste' and specialization of individuals. This is followed by a section on 'totipotency' in which we consider the autonomy and subjugation of individuals. Under this heading we consider various aspects such as intracolony conflict, worker reproductive potential and physiological or morphological restrictions which limit individuals' capacities to perform a range of tasks or functions. A section entitled 'organization of work' considers a variety of aspects, e.g. the ability to tackle group, team or partitioned tasks, foraging strategics and colony reliability and efficiency. A final section, 'communication and functional integration', considers how individual activity is coordinated to produce an integrated and adaptive colony. Within each section we use illustrative examples drawn from the social insect literature (mostly from ants, for which there is the best data) to illustrate concepts or trends and make a number of predictions concerning how a particular trait is expected to correlate with other aspects of social complexity. Within each section we also expand the scope of the arguments to consider these relationships in a much broader sense of 'sociality' by drawing parallels with other 'social' entities such as multicellular individuals, which can be understood as 'societies' of cells. The aim is to draw out any parallels and common causal relationships among the correlates. Two themes run through the study. The first is the role of colony size as an important factor affecting social complexity. The second is the complexity of individual workers in relation to the complexity of the colony. Consequently, this is an ideal opportunity to test a previously proposed hypothesis that 'individuals of highly social ant species arc less complex than individuals from simple ant species' in light of numerous social correlates. Our findings support this hypothesis. In summary, we conclude that, in general, complex societies arc characterized by large colony size, worker polymorphism, strong behavioural specialization and loss of totipotency in its workers, low individual complexity, decentralized colony control and high system redundancy, low individual competence, a high degree of worker cooperation when tackling tasks, group foraging strategies, high tempo, multi-chambered tailor-made nests, high functional integration, relatively greater use of cues and modulatory signals to coordinate individuals and heterogeneous patterns of worker-worker interaction.","individual versus social complexity, with particular reference to ant colonies","Insect societies - colonies of ants, bees, wasps and termites"

We recorded data on flower features, pollen and ovule number, pollen/ovule ratio, pollen size, self-compatibility, floral visitors, and pollination. Flowers are mostly hermaphrodite, inconspicuous, small, and green. Six species are dioecious. Over 806 of the cosexual species are self compatible. However, many species are dichogamous (mostly protandrous); thus, even the self-compatible species may require pollen transfer. Selfing through geitonogamy seems to be the most common system, and several species express mixed breeding systems. Floral visitors are uncommon to rare, except for two hummingbird species (one native and one endemic) that visit five species we studied. In more than 300 h of observation of flowers over three field seasons, we detected only 23 native insect visits representing ten species (Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Coleoptera). One species each of an introduced ant and an introduced bee were also observed on some flowers, all near the single human settlement of San Juan Bautista. Wind directly moving pollen, or indirectly via shaking the flowers. is the most important pollen distribution mechanism. The majority of the wind-pollinated species bear some typical anemophilous features, but also others not characteristic of wind pollination, that presumably represent the condition of their biotically pollinated ancestors. Floral features often reflect ancestral reproductive systems, so floral biology studies of oceanic islands in particular must be done with cognizance of presumed ancestral forms, because the observed characters can be misleading.","breeding system and pollination of selected plants endemic to juan","We conducted field studies on the Juan Fernandez Islands flora"

We then analyzed if the species composition differed between the two sides of the road; first for the whole community, and then only for the smallest species (which typically are poorer dispersers). As a complement, we analyzed if different vegetation variables differed between the two sides of the road, as this may also affect differences in species composition. Finally, we analyzed if species richness and abundance in general differed between the two sides and how these two response variables were explained by the vegetation variables. There was a significant difference in species composition between the eastern and the western side of the road when analyzing the whole community, and this relationship became even stronger when the largest species were excluded. The vegetation variables did not strongly differ between the two sides, and there was no difference in species richness and abundance of bees and wasps either. Abundance was, however, explained by the number of flowering plants in the surroundings of the trap. Even though using a rather limited data set, our results indicate that large roads may act as barriers on the movement of bees and wasps, especially for small species with poor dispersal ability.

Most studies on bees have defined habitat fragments as remnant patches of floral hosts or forests, overlooking the nesting needs of bees. Their conclusion is that habitat fragmentation is broadly deleterious; however, there are contrasting results in the literature. Insightful studies on habitat fragmentation and bees should consider fragmentation, alteration and loss of nesting habitats-not just patches of forage plants -, as well as the permeability of the surrounding matrix to interpatch movement. Here we investigated the effects of fragmentation caused by urbanization on stingless bee species' composition and richness, as well as the permeability of the surrounding matrix. We collected bees from flowering plants and recorded phytosociological variables of five forest remnants (ranging from 64 ha to 900 ha) in southeastern Brazil. Large fragments did not contain more species per unit area than smaller ones; in fact, we found more species in small fragments, most of which were generalist bees. The presence of more habitat generalist stingless bee species was also correlated to the structure of vegetation in these fragments. In conclusion, the quality of the habitat within a fragment (structure of vegetation) as well as the quality of the matrix has a direct relation to the bee species composition. This can be seen in the direct relationship between structural diversity of the environment and age of the fragments. The matrix that holds the most recent fragments, probably due to the sprawl of the city, is more heterogeneous than the one with the oldest fragments. The most heterogeneous matrices have a certain balance between the trees, buildings and bare soil or herbaceous vegetation coverage, making the array less impermeable to bees.","richness, composition and trophic niche of stingless bee assemblages in","Few studies directly address the consequences of habitat fragmentation for"

Most of these visitors exhibit low fidelity and forage opportunistically on numerous competing tree species. Presentation of nectar in alternating rhythms between the male and hermaphrodite trees appears to induce pollinator movement between them. Out of such alternating visits between the sexes, a low level of short‐range inter‐tree pollen transfer by trigonids and butterflies seems to occur. Despite the elaborate system which promotes pollinator movement between the sexes, this species has retained a low level of self‐compatibility. The physical barriers to pollinator movement in the understorey, and high interspecific competition for pollinators by a large number of tree species, appear therefore to make it difficult to maintain an obligate outbreeding system.

Thus, the variation in weather conditions during reproduction, mediated by prey limitations, should be mirrored in annual reproduction performance, and finally in annual breeding success. We analysed the effect of local weather conditions on the availability of airborne insects and on the variation in brood size and nestling condition of European bee-eaters Merops apiaster at the northern edge of their range where years with adverse weather frequently occur. The availability of large flying insects, the common prey of bee-eaters, increased with air temperatures and duration of daily sunshine. As predicted, local weather conditions affected reproductive performance with annual breeding success (mean 3.7 nestlings per breeding pair, range 1.7-4.9 nestlings) being up to 32 % higher in extraordinary dry and hot summers. Additionally, a nestling's body condition (residual mass) was also affected by sunshine duration during their growth period and internally was co-affected by the number of siblings and the individual rank within the sibling hierarchy. Thus, a prolonged duration of daily sunshine causes a cascade from higher insect flight activity, and, thus, higher food availability for chick-rearing bee-eaters, which finally translates into better chick body conditions and higher annual breeding success. Consequently reproduction and population development of European bee-eaters might be especially susceptible to regional changes in weather and climatic conditions.","strong cascading effect of weather conditions on prey availability and","Aerial insectivorous birds depend highly on favourable weather conditions for"

Adults and larvae feed on pollen, honey, and brood in bee hives. The beetle is also able to feed and reproduce on fresh or rotting fruit, but natural occurrence on this diet has rarely been observed. We compared the reproductive success - as measured by progeny production, weight of progeny, developmental rate, and survival of immature stages - of beetles reared on various diets of fruit and bee products. Reproduction on all of the diets was sufficient for population growth. Using baited flight traps to monitor the presence of A. tumida, we found persistent although tenuous populations in wooded habitats lacking managed bee colonies. On the basis of these findings and the habits of other nitidulid beetles, we propose that A. tumida is an ecological generalist able to maintain adequate levels of reproduction in marginal environments but able to reach high levels in favorable, resource rich environments, such as honey bee colonies. This hypothesis has significance for active dispersal and range expansion, because reproduction in the absence of bees would facilitate long range dispersal by flight through successive generations. Although our findings support the hypothesis, definitive proof would require association of beetles with hosts, trapping adults as they emerge from the soil, or other methods that would confirm feeding and reproduction at a given site, rather than immigration from bee colonies.","trophic habits of aethina tumida (coleoptera: nitidulidae): their adaptive significance","Aethina tumida Murray is an African native that has become"

To investigate if such exposure is detrimental to bees, many studies have exclusively fed individuals with pesticide-spiked food, informing us about the hazard but not necessarily the risk of exposure. While such studies are important to establish the physiological and behavioural effects on individuals, they do not consider the possibility that the risk of exposure may change over time. For example, many pesticide assays exclude potential behavioural adaptations to novel toxins, such as rejection of harmful compounds by choosing to feed on an uncontaminated food source, thus behaviourally lowering the risk of exposure. In this paper, we conducted an experiment over 10 days in which bumblebees could forage on an array of sucrose feeders containing 0, 2 and 11 parts per billion of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam. This more closely mimics pesticide exposure in the wild by allowing foraging bees to (i) experience a field realistic range of pesticide concentrations across a chronic exposure period, (ii) have repeated interactions with the pesticide in their environment, and (iii) retain the social cues associated with foraging by using whole colonies. We found that the proportion of visits to pesticide-laced feeders increased over time, resulting in greater consumption of pesticide-laced sucrose relative to untreated sucrose. After changing the spatial position of each feeder, foragers continued to preferentially visit the pesticide-laced feeders which indicates that workers can detect thiamethoxam and alter their behaviour to continue feeding on it. The increasing preference for consuming the neonicotinoid- treated food therefore increases the risk of exposure for the colony during prolonged pesticide exposure. Our results highlight the need to incorporate attractiveness of pesticides to foraging bees (and potentially other insect pollinators) in addition to simply considering the proportion of pesticide-contaminated floral resources within the foraging landscape. © 2019 The Authors.","foraging bumblebees acquire a preference for neonicotinoid-treated food with prolonged","Social bees represent an important group of pollinating insects that"

We aimed to detect the main factors that should be considered in a multiple-scale approach for small forest patches in order to contribute to the conservation plans for stingless bees. The study was conducted in small forest patches of the Atlantic Forest, in the municipality of Salto de Pirapora (SP, Brazil). The spatial analysis was developed based on forest patch size, forest patch core size, distance from the nearest forest patch, and distance from the nearest body of water. Based on these criteria, we selected three hotspot forest patches (including all criteria that favor the presence of stingless bees with arboreal nesting habits) and three control forest patches (which does not fulfill all these criteria), and we evaluated the presence of stingless bees based on the occupation of artificial shelters installed in the patches. From the 72 installed artificial shelters, we observed 27 shelters (37.5%) carrying some association with stingless bees presence. Bees showed a preference for occupying artificial shelters that were located in the patches’ cores (66.7%). The structure and composition of the vegetation showed great importance to the occupation of the artificial shelters, as there was a strong correlation between the occupied shelters and the diameter and the height of the trees. There was also a correlation between the presence of grasses and shrubs (p < 0.05), which were the main providers of floral resources. The data of the land cover was an essential factor for the development of spatial analysis, and we found a strong negative correlation with pastures and a positive correlation with forestry (p < 0.05).

Memorization of these cues facilitates the localization and recognition of food sources during foraging flights. Bees can also use information gained inside the hive during social interactions with successful foragers. An important information cue that can be learned during these interactions is food odor. However, little is known about how floral odors learned in the hive affect later decisions of foragers in the field. We studied the effect of food scent on foraging preferences when this learning is acquired directly inside the hive. By using in-hive feeders that were removed 24 h before the test, we showed that foragers use the odor information acquired during a 3-day stimulation period with a scented solution during a food-choice situation outside the nest. This bias in food preference is maintained even 24 h after the replacement of all the hive combs. Thus, without being previously collected outside by foragers, food odors learned within the hive can be used during short-range foraging flights. Moreover, correct landings at a dual-choice device after replacing the storing combs suggests that long-term memories formed within the colony can be retrieved while bees search for food in the field. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","floral odor learning within the hive affects honeybees' foraging decisions","Honeybees learn odor cues quickly and efficiently when visiting rewarding"

Herbaceous plants in the open surrounding wetlands may also depend on these pollinators. We investigated pollinator diversity and abundances in both tree island and marl prairie habitats using transect sampling methods and estimated pollination success of the milkweed Asclepias lanceolata, an insect-pollinated marl prairie species, in relation to distance from and size of the closest tree island. On a total of 11 bayhead tree islands, we found that insect diversity and abundance were greater on the edge of larger tree islands (20-30 m(2)) than on smaller tree islands (5-10 m(2)). Pollinator diversity and abundance in the marl prairie decreased with increasing distance from tree islands. Pairs of potted A. lanceolata plants were placed in the marl prairie at distances up to 1000 m from small and large tree islands. Fruit and seed production were highest for plants placed less than 25 m from tree islands and decreased with increasing distance. Our results suggest that tree islands are an important source of pollinators for the plants in the tree island and surrounding wetland habitats. This landscape-based study illustrates how overall landscape structure affects important biotic interactions, particularly plant-pollinator relationships.

By tracking the position of the centre of mass of the bird in three dimensions, we were able to calculate the power required to increase the potential and kinetic energy. In addition, high-speed video recordings of the position of the wings over the course of the wing stroke, and morphological measurements, allowed us to calculate the aerodynamic and inertial power requirements. The total power output required from the pectoralis muscle was, on average, 390 W kg-1, which was similar to the highest measurements made on bundles of muscle fibres in vitro (433 W kg-1), although for one individual a power output of 530 W kg-1 was calculated. The majority of the power was required to increase the potential energy of the body. The power output of these muscles is the highest yet found for any muscle in repetitive contractions. We also calculated the power requirements during take-off flights in four other species in the family Phasianidae. Power output was found to be independent of body mass in this family. However, the precise scaling of burst power output within this group must await a better assessment of whether similar levels of performance were measured across the group. We extended our analysis to one species of hawk, several species of hummingbird and two species of bee. Remarkably, we concluded that, over a broad range of body size (0.0002-5 kg) and contractile frequency (5-186 Hz), the myofibrillar power output of flight muscles during short maximal bursts is very high (360-460 W kg-1) and shows very little scaling with body mass. The approximate constancy of power output means that the work output varies inversely with wingbeat frequency and reaches values of approximately 30-60 J kg-1 in the largest species.","the mechanical power output of the flight muscles of blue-breasted","Blue-breasted quail (Coturnix chinensis) were filmed during take-off flights.

Understanding how increasing habitat loss affects ecological processes is critical for mitigating the effects of environmental changes on biodiversity and thus on the supply of ecosystem services by natural habitats. Habitat loss negatively affects pollinator diversity and the pollination service provided by insects, a key ecosystem service supporting the quantity, quality and diversity of crops directly consumed by humans and the sexual reproduction of most flowering plants. By integrating evolutionary relationships among traits that may modulate plant response to habitat loss, the structure of plant-pollinator interaction networks and metacommunity models, we examine how plant-pollinator metacommunities might respond to habitat loss. The main predictions of our trait-based metacommunity model are that (1) variation on dispersal ability among plant species may prevent full metacommunity collapse under pollinator loss associated with increasing habitat loss; (2) habitat loss may select for plants with higher dispersal ability and higher autogamous self-pollination, and will typically decrease the incidence of pollination generalist plants; (3) metacommunities that comprise plants with high autonomous self-pollination ability may harbour higher richness of rare plant species when pollinator diversity declines with increased habitat loss.

It is unknown how these changes have affected the native bee community. We surveyed the bee communities in relatively intact native prairie at two National Wildlife Refuges in Texas, quantifying bee community structure as a function of the presence/absence of grazing by prairie dogs.

Although the same three species dominated the bee community at both refuges, most species were represented by relatively few individuals, leading to overall differences in diversity (richness, evenness, and effective number of species) by refuge. Bee diversity differed between sites on and off prairie dog colonies, but in trends that differed by refuge and by index, suggesting that location was more important than prairie dog presence.These results represent a reference fauna against which other regional bee communities in other land-cover types can be compared, but the high spatial heterogeneity we found indicates that detecting effects of landscape change on native bees will be challenging.","wildlife refuges support high bee diversity on the southern great","The native prairie of the southern Great Plains has been"

The demand for nectar and pollen varies during the year, with more pollen needed in spring for colony population growth and more nectar needed in summer to sustain the maximum colony size and collect surplus nectar stores for winter. Sufficient bee forage is therefore necessary to ensure a healthy bee colony. Land-use changes can reduce the availability of floral resources suitable for bees, thereby increasing the susceptibility of bees to other stressors such as disease and pesticides. In contrast, land-based management decisions to protect or plant bee forage can enhance pollen and nectar supply to bees while meeting other goals such as riparian planting for water-quality improvement. Commercial demand for honey can also put pressure on floral resources through over-crowding of hives. To help understand and manage floral resources for bees, we developed a spatial model for mapping monthly nectar and pollen production from maps of land cover. Based on monthly estimated production data we mapped potential monthly supply of nectar and pollen to a given apiary location in the landscape. This is done by summing the total production within the foraging range of the apiary while subtracting the estimated nectar converted to energy for collection. Ratios of estimated supply over theoretical hive demand may then be used to infer a potential landscape carrying capacity to sustain hives. This model framework is quantitative and spatial, utilizing estimated flight energy costs for nectar foraging. It can contribute to management decisions such as where apiaries could be placed in the landscape depending on floral resources and where nectar limited areas may be located. It can contribute to planning areas for bee protection or planting such as in riparian vegetation. This would aid managed bee health, wild pollinator protection, and honey production.

Such social learning might be explained by relatively simple associative learning mechanism: the bee may learn to associate conspecifics with nectar or pollen reward through previous experience of foraging jointly. However, in some studies, observers were guided by choices of 'demonstrators' viewed through a screen, so no reward was given to the observers at the time of seeing other bees' flowers choice and no demonstrator bee was present at the moment of decision. This behaviour, referred to observational conditioning, implies an additional associative step as the positive value of conspecific is transferred to the associated flower. Here we explore the role of demonstrator movement, and the distance between observers and demonstrators that is required for observation conditioning to take place. Methodology/Principal Findings: We identify the conditions under which observational conditioning occurs in the widespread European species Bombus terrestris. The presence of artificial demonstrator bees leads to a significant change in individual colour preference toward the indicated colour if demonstrators were moving and observation distance was limited (15 cm), suggesting that observational conditioning could only influence relatively short-range foraging decisions. In addition, the movement of demonstrators is a crucial factor for observational conditioning, either due to the more life-like appearance of moving artificial bees or an enhanced detectability of moving demonstrators, and an increased efficiency at directing attention to the indicated flower colour. Conclusion: Bumblebees possess the capacity to learn the quality of a flower by distal observation of other foragers' choices. This confirms that social learning in bees involves more advanced processes than simple associative learning, and indicates that observational conditioning might be widespread in pollinating insects, raising intriguing questions for the underlying mechanisms as well as the spread of social information in pollinator-plant interactions. © 2014 Avarguès-Weber, Chittka.","observational conditioning in flower choice copying by bumblebees (bombus terrestris):","Background: Bumblebees use information provided inadvertently by conspecifics when deciding"

The goal is achieved in three stages: calibration of flow sensor, design of robust IoT node with embedded power management and packaging of the complete system. The aim of calibration is to enhance the linearity range by choosing a suitable meter constant K for the turbine flow sensor. It helps to make the system adaptive to variations in pressure and flow rate. The sensor data is processed and sent to the cloud using power efficient ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC chip. The packaging of the complete system is done to make it watertight and suitable for usage in real-life environments. By efficient real-time tracking, users can reduce bill and save water. © 2018 IEEE.","flow sensor iot node for wi-fi equipped apartments and gated","Water crisis is a major issue across various cities in"

Such behavioral sequences can be of critical ecological importance, for example relating to resource acquisition, predator evasion, and sexual selection. The role of sequential behaviors in ecology, however, is understudied, in substantial part due to the difficulty of quantifying complex sequences. Here, we present a modified version of determinism (DET) from recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) as a standard metric for quantifying sequential behaviors. We focus on a case study of trapline foraging, a taxonomically widespread behavioral strategy in which animals repeatedly visit spatially fixed resources in a predictable order. Using a bumble bee movement dataset, we demonstrate how to calculate DET and create and interpret recurrence plots, which visually demonstrate patterns in foraging sequences. We show a new method for statistical comparisons of DET scores and assess the sensitivity of DET to resource density using simulated foraging sequences. We find that DET complements and offers distinct advantages over previously available methods for many questions and datasets since it does not depend on any particular resource arrangement or experimental setup and is relatively insensitive to resource density. These features make DET a powerful tool for comparing sequential behaviors between differing environments in a range of ecologically important contexts. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","determinism as a statistical metric for ecologically important recurrent behaviors","Patterns of discrete behaviors tied together in specific sequences are"

The fact that most of these substances have an unpalatable taste for humans and other mammals contrasts with the fact that honeybees do not reject them in the range of concentrations in which these compounds are present in flower nectars. Here we asked whether honeybees detect and ingest deterrent substances and whether these substances are really toxic to them. Results: We show that pairing aversive substances with an odor retards learning of this odor when it is subsequently paired with sucrose. Harnessed honeybees in the laboratory ingest without reluctance a considerable volume (20 mu l) of various aversive substances, even if some of them induce significant post-ingestional mortality. These substances do not seem, therefore, to be unpalatable to harnessed bees but induce a malaise-like state that in some cases results in death. Consistently with this finding, bees learning that one odor is associated with sugar, and experiencing in a subsequent phase that the sugar was paired with 20 mu l of an aversive substance (devaluation phase), respond less than control bees to the odor and the sugar. Such stimulus devaluation can be accounted for by the malaise-like state induced by the aversive substances. Conclusion: Our results indicate that substances that taste bitter to humans as well as concentrated saline solutions base their aversive effect on the physiological consequences that their ingestion generates in harnessed bees rather than on an unpalatable taste. This conclusion is only valid for harnessed bees in the laboratory as freely-moving bees might react differently to aversive compounds could actively reject aversive substances. Our results open a new possibility to study conditioned taste aversion based on post-ingestional malaise and thus broaden the spectrum of aversive learning protocols available in honeybees.","toxic but drank: gustatory aversive compounds induce post-ingestional malaise in","Background: Deterrent substances produced by plants are relevant due to"

Of this group, Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata (CCV) is widespread in south-eastern Queensland and northern New South Wales. It is currently the most commonly harvested native hardwood in Queensland. However, little basic knowledge of the reproductive biology of the species is available to inform genetic improvement and resource management programmes. Here we take an integrative approach, using both field and molecular data, to identify ecological factors important to mating patterns in native populations of CCV. Field observation of pollinator visitation and flowering phenology of 20 trees showed that foraging behaviour of pollinator guilds varies depending on flowering phenology and canopy structure. A positive effect of tree mean flowering effort was found on insect visitation, while bat visitation was predicted by tree height and by the number of trees simultaneously bearing flowers. Moreover, introduced honeybees were observed frequently, performing 73% of detected flower visits. Conversely, nectar-feeding birds and mammals were observed sporadically with lorikeets and honeyeaters each contributing to 11% of visits. Fruit bats, represented solely by the grey-headed flying fox, performed less than 2% of visits. Genotyping at six microsatellite markers in 301 seeds from 17 families sampled from four of Queensland’s native forests showed that CCV displays a mixed-mating system that is mostly outcrossing (tm=0.899 ± 0.021). Preferential effective pollination from near-neighbours was detected by means of maximum-likelihood paternity analysis with up to 16% of reproduction events resulting from selfing. Forty to 48% of fertilising pollen was also carried from longer distance (&gt;60 m). Marked differences in foraging behaviour and visitation frequency between observed pollinator guilds suggests that the observed dichotomy of effective pollen movement in spotted gums may be due to frequent visit from introduced honeybees favouring geitonogamy and sporadic visits from honeyeaters and fruit bats resulting in potential long-distance pollinations. © NISC Pty Ltd.","reproductive biology of corymbia citriodorasubsp. variegata and effective pollination across","The spotted gum species complex represents a group of four"

What is the relationship between flowering phenology and pollen occurring in honey sediments? Location: Mediterranean sylvo-pastoral system in Gallura, Sardinia, Italy. Methods: Phytosociological and phenological surveys were performed in a circular area of 1.5 km radius with a small apiary placed in the centre. Polleniferous and nectariferous values of plant communities were assessed based on the cover and the polleniferous and nectariferous value of each constituting species. Honey production was quantified during the main flow (March-June) and subjected to melissopalynological analysis. Data were evaluated by ordination through principal components analysis and principal coordinates analysis. The latter utilized a new index, developed for calculating the phenological distances based on the individual distributions of flowering frequencies. Results: Plant communities richest in species providing pollen and nectar were Rhamnus hedges. There was a close correlation between polleniferous and nectariferous values, suggesting that plant communities are important for honeybee foraging of both resources. The temporal flowering sequence ensured the supply of nectar and pollen throughout the spring season. Pollen foraged from 12 Trifolium species with different flowering phenology was the most abundant. Salix purpurea and Rhamnus alaternus were productive at the beginning of the season, followed by Lavandula stoechas, Echium plantagineum and E. italicum. Conclusions: Plant communities vary in importance for honeybee foraging mainly due to differences in floristic composition and flowering phenology. Communities characterized by human presence (e.g. semi-natural grasslands and hedges) are the most relevant. Some target species (e.g. Trifolium spp.) favoured by grazing livestock ensure foraging for honeybees throughout the season.

However, the floral traits that influence pollinator visitation are not usually the focus of breeding programmes, and therefore, it is likely that yield improvements may be made by optimizing floral traits to enhance pollinator visitation rates. We investigated the variation present in the floral reward of the bee-pollinated crop Vicia faba (field bean). We examined the genetic potential for breeding flowers with a greater reward into current commercial varieties and used bee behavioral experiments to gain insight into the optimal nectar concentration to maximize bee preference. There was a large range of variation in the amount of pollen and nectar reward of flowers in the genotypes investigated. Bee behavioral experiments using nectar sugar concentrations found in V.faba lines suggest that Bombus terrestris prefers 55% w/w sugar solution over 40% w/w, but has no preference between 55% w/w and 68% w/w sugar solution. We provide a first indication of the force required to open V.faba flowers. Our results provide a valuable starting point toward breeding for varieties with optimized floral reward. Field studies are now needed to verify whether the genetic potential for breeding more rewarding flowers can translate into higher yield and yield stability.","an analysis of the energetic reward offered by field bean","Global consumption of crops with a yield that is dependent"

Several studies have previously shown that pollination services are greater in crops adjoining forest patches or other seminatural habitats than in crops completely surrounded by other crops. In this study, we investigated the specific importance of forest edges in providing potential pollinators in B. napus fields in two areas in France. Bees were caught with yellow pan traps at increasing distances from both warm and cold forest edges into B. napus fields during the blooming period. A total of 4594 individual bees, representing six families and 83 taxa, were collected. We found that both bee abundance and taxa richness were negatively affected by the distance from forest edge. However, responses varied between bee groups and edge orientations. The ITD (Inter-Tegular distance) of the species, a good proxy for bee foraging range, seems to limit how far the bees can travel from the forest edge. We found a greater abundance of cuckoo bees (Nomada spp.) of Andrena spp. and Andrena spp. males at forest edges, which we assume indicate suitable nesting sites, or at least mating sites, for some abundant Andrena species and their parasites (Fig. ).

This study provides one of the first examples in temperate ecosystems of how forest edges may actually act as a reservoir of potential pollinators and directly benefit agricultural crops by providing nesting or mating sites for important early spring pollinators.

Honey samples collected randomly from apiaries located in those areas were analyzed for pesticide residues with a multianalytical method, able to determine simultaneously up to 10 organophosphorous insecticides from the same honey extract. Findings concerning the acaricide coumaphos were also included, even though it is not used in crop protection. Coumaphos is used to control the mite Varroa destructor, an external parasite of the honeybee. The above areas are cultivated in large extent with citrus trees or cotton or sunflower crops, which are good forages for honeybees. The main pests of those crops are insects; hence, insecticides are used on a large scale for crop protection. The most contaminated samples originated from citrus groves; 16 out of 19 had pesticide residues: 4 samples had chlorfenvinphos (21.05%), 10 had chlorpyrifos (52.63%) and 2 had phorate (10.53%). Out of 17 samples from cotton fields, residues were found in 8, phorate in 6 (35.29%), chlorfenvinphos in 1 (5.88%), and chlorpyrifos in 1 (5.88%). Out of nine samples from fields of sunflower, four had phorate residues (44.44%). In brief, from the 50 analyzed samples, residues of chlorfenvinphos were detected in 5 samples (10%), residues of chlorpyrifos in 11 samples (22%), and residues of phorate in 12 samples (24%). Their levels ranged between 0.70 and 0.89 mu g/kg. Coumaphos residues ranged from 0.10 up to 4.80 mu g/kg and were derived exclusively from beehives treated with Perizin (the commercial formulation of coumaphos) for Varroa control. This study indicates that in agricultural areas with developed apiculture, useful information about the occurrence and the distribution of pesticide residues due to crop protection treatments can be derived from the analysis of randomly collected honey samples, used as bioindicators. It also shows that, very often, the chemicals used by apiculturists inside the hives in order to control disease are the main pollutants of the produced honey.","bee honey as an environmental bioindicator of pesticides' occurrence in","The pollution of six agricultural areas of Greece (north, central,"

However, it also identified a summer foraging 'hotspot' in agricultural land at 2-3. km distance. Unfortunately, dance decoding does not yield precise foraging locations or information on the flower species visited. Therefore, we surveyed this hotspot during July and August 2012 and 2013 in order to identify the habitats and flower species used by honey bees and other flower-visiting insects (FVI).The hotspot area consisted predominantly of four habitat types potentially attractive to FVI: pasture fields, field margins/hedgerows of arable fields, set-aside and a National Nature Reserve. We surveyed three fields within each habitat type. The abundance of flowers was found to be a key determent of FVI abundance per field (p= 0.002). Field margins/hedgerows were the most flower abundant habitat type (p= 0.002) and had more than twice (235%) the FVI abundance (p= 0.001) and species richness (p= 0.035) per unit area than did pasture fields. Areas with long grass had greater flower abundance (p< 0.001) and FVI species richness (p= 0.009) than those with short grass (≤30 cm). The five plants on which we recorded the greatest number of FVI were species considered to be agricultural weeds.Honey bees represented 19% of all FVI, showing that dance decoding had located a hotspot that was an important foraging location not just for honey bees but also for other types of FVI. Honey bee abundance, per transect, was strongly correlated with that of other FVI (p= 0.001), particularly bumble bees (p < 0.001). However, FVI groups were not found uniformly across our study site and honey bee abundance was only weakly linked to overall species richness (p= 0.069). © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","following the dance: ground survey of flowers and flower-visiting insects","Decoding of honey bee waggle dances has previously shown that"

Further insight into the temporal relationships of pollinators and their flowering partners is required to inform conservation efforts. Here we examined the phenology of British: (i) pollinator activity; (ii) insect-pollinated plant flowering; and (iii) extinct and endangered pollinator and plant species. Over 1 million records were collated from the historical databases of three British insect monitoring organisations, a global biodiversity database and an authoritative text covering the national flora. Almost two-thirds (62%) of pollinator species have peak flight observations during late-summer (July and August). This was the case across three of the groups studied: aculeate wasps (71% of species), bees (60%), and butterflies (72%), the exception being hoverflies (49%). When species geographical range (a proxy for abundance) was accounted for, a clear late-summer peak was clear across all groups. By contrast, there is marked temporal partitioning in the flowering of the major plant groups: insect-pollinated tree species blossoming predominantly during May (74%), shrubs in June (69%), and herbs in July (83%). There was a positive correlation between the number of pollinator species on the wing and the richness of both flowering insect-pollinated herbs and trees/shrubs species, per calendar month. In addition, significantly greater extinctions occurred in late-summer-flying pollinator species than expected (83% of extinct species vs. 62% of all species). This trend was driven primarily by bee extinctions (80% vs. 60%) and was not apparent in other groups. We contend that this is principally due to declines in late-summer resource supplies, which are almost entirely provisioned by herbs, a consequence of historical land-use change. We hypothesize that the seasonality of interspecific competition and the blooming of trees and mass-flowering crops may have partially buffered spring-flying pollinators from the impacts of historical change. © 2018","british phenological records indicate high diversity and extinction rates among","The long-term decline of wild and managed insect pollinators is"

The vast majority (84%) of dances were for locations outside of the orchards in which our colonies were located. Accounting for the distance of orchards and oilseed rape fields from the study colonies, the amount of foraging per hectare in oilseed rape fields was greater than in orchards.

As the foraging season progressed from early May till late June over three consecutive years (2016-2018), most stylopized bees possessed endoparasitic adult (neotenic) females of S. advarians protruding from the bee gaster's dorsum. In contrast, very few adult bees stylopized by male puparia, and no free-living males, were encountered. Over the sampling period, prevalence remained around 22% each year; mean intensity was 1.2 (range of 1-3 female parasites per bee); and parasite abundance was 0.27. Also newly reported for Stylops is the occurrence of one bee bearing four Stylops (two neotenic females and two males with puparia), plus another bee with a male puparium extruded from its gaster's sternites. Around May 2 each year, a high proportion of the earliest captured female bees were stylopized. However, non-stylopized female bees typically were not encountered until about 10 days later, suggesting the parasites manipulate female bee hosts to emerge earlier, in close synchrony to male bee emergence.

Temporal and spatial variation of flower resources affects foraging decisions of wild and honey bees. To optimise crop pollination management a better understanding of potential competition for pollinators in mass- and minor-flowering crops is needed. We combined waggle dance decoding, pollen load analysis and field surveys to identify the habitat preferences and pollen use of honey bees in response to spatio-temporal changes in resource availability. Observation hives were placed on the edge of eleven fields of blooming strawberries (mean 2.24 ha) located in landscapes with different amounts of oilseed rape (OSR), semi-natural habitats (SNH) and apple trees in Germany. In addition, we surveyed honey bees and wild bees in strawberry fields. Honey bee dances more often indicated strawberry, OSR fields and SNH than expected given their landscape-wide areas. Honey bees collected on average 7.9 % strawberry, 49.0 % OSR, 30.2 % Pyrus type (e.g. apple) and 12.9 % other pollen types. The mean honey bee foraging distance was 740 m, and decreased with OSR availability. In the observation hives, dances for strawberry fields were not directly affected by OSR availability or SNH land cover. But large amounts of OSR reduced overall honey bee and bumble bee abundance in strawberry fields, while solitary bees were unaffected. Bumble bees were most abundant in strawberry fields (54.1%) and together with solitary bees (19.7%) they represented about 75.0% of the observed bees. Minor-flowering strawberry fields represent a preferred resource for honey bees, especially for small colonies as indicated by decoding of waggle dances. However, the availability of more attractive OSR and local strawberry flower cover moderates the abundance of social bees (honey bees and bumble bees) in strawberry fields while other wild bees were less affected. Hence, we conclude that wild bee conservation plays a major role for strawberry pollination. If pollination services by solitary bees are limited, small honey bee hives can be used scrupulously to supplement pollination services in strawberries. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","foraging of honey bees in agricultural landscapes with changing patterns","The demand for crop pollination is increasing and honey bees"

The author, both experimenter and tear source, marked the minute bees while they drank from his eyes viewed in a mirror. All marked workers, 34 L. cacciae and 23 L. furva, came repeatedly to engorge, 34 and 27 times on average, respectively. The maximum number of times the same L. cacciae and L. furva came was 78 and 144 visits in one day, respectively; the maximum over two days was 145 visits by one L. cacciae; the maximum number of visiting days by the same bee was four over seven days by one L. furva which made 65 visits totally. The same forager may collect tears for more than 10 h in a day, on average for 3 h 15 min and 2 h 14 min for L. cacciae and L. furva, respectively. Engorging from the inner eye corner averaged 3.1 and 2.2 min, respectively, but only 1.3 and 0.9 min when settled on the lower eye lid/ciliae. The interval between consecutive visits averaged 3.3 min and 3.8 min, respectively. Lachryphagy occurred during all months of the year, with 91-320 foragers a day during the hot season and 6-280 foragers during the rainy season; tear collecting resumed after a downpour. During the cold season eye visitation was reduced to 3-64 foragers, but none left her nest when the temperature was below 22°C. Flying ranges were greater than in comparable non-lachryphagous meliponines. It is proposed that Lisotrigona colonies have workers that are, besides nectar and pollen foragers, specialized tear collectors. Tears are 200 times richer in proteins than sweat, a secretion well-known to be imbibed by many meliponines. Digestion of proteins dissolved in tears is not hampered by an exine wall as in pollen, and they have bactericidal properties. These data corroborate the inference that Lisotrigona, which also visit other mammals, birds and reptiles, harvest lachrymation mainly for its content of proteins rather than only for salt and water. © 2018 Siam Society.

However, little attention has been devoted to the study of this aspect in social insects. A recent study based on a single day of observation showed that colony members of the paper wasp Polistes dominula were spatially arranged on the comb in a predictable way. Alpha females patrolled a small central area of the comb, while subordinates and workers were mostly active in the nest periphery. The present study investigated the existence of a spatial-temporal polyethism in P. dominula by studying whether workers and foundresses change their within-nest spatial behaviour over their lifespan. The results showed that while the age of a worker weakly influenced the probability that she performed a within-nest task or foraged outside, it did not account for any aspect of the wasp's within-nest spatial behaviour. Precisely, the size of the patrolled area, the position on the comb, and the rate of superimposition with other nestmates were all not related to the age of the wasp. Moreover, no evident spatial segregation between young and old individuals occurred on the comb. These findings suggest that other proximate mechanisms underlie the observed colony spatial organization. As the reproductive division of labour was the only factor affecting wasp spatial sorting within the nest, dominance hierarchy and social interactions between and within foundress and workers represent good candidates responsible for the colony's spatial organization.","the reproductive division of labour but not worker age affects","Spatial behaviour of colony members within a nest represents an"

Nonetheless, only few studies have been carried out with pollinators, usually emphasizing the honeybee Apis mellifera and neglecting other important pollinator species such as the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Here, lethal and sublethal effects of azadirachtin were studied on B. terrestris via oral exposure in the laboratory to bring out the potential risks of the compound to this important pollinator. The compound was tested at different concentrations above and below the maximum concentration that is used in the field (32 mg L−1). As most important results, azadirachtin repelled bumblebee workers in a concentration-dependent manner. The median repellence concentration (RC50) was estimated as 504 mg L−1. Microcolonies chronically exposed to azadirachtin via treated sugar water during 11 weeks in the laboratory exhibited a high mortality ranging from 32 to 100 % with a range of concentrations between 3.2 and 320 mg L−1. Moreover, no reproduction was scored when concentrations were higher than 3.2 mg L−1. At 3.2 mg L−1, azadirachtin significantly inhibited the egg-laying and, consequently, the production of drones during 6 weeks. Ovarian length decreased with the increase of the azadirachtin concentration. When azadirachtin was tested under an experimental setup in the laboratory where bumblebees need to forage for food, the sublethal effects were stronger as the numbers of drones were reduced already with a concentration of 0.64 mg L−1. Besides, a negative correlation was found between the body mass of male offspring and azadirachtin concentration. In conclusion, our results as performed in the laboratory demonstrated that azadirachtin can affect B. terrestris with a range of sublethal effects. Taking into account that sublethal effects are as important as lethal effects for the development and survival of the colonies of B. terrestris, this study confirms the need to test compounds on their safety, especially when they have to perform complex tasks such as foraging. The latter agrees with the recent European Food Safety Authority guidelines to assess ‘potentially deleterious’ compounds for sublethal effects on behavior. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","lethal and sublethal effects of azadirachtin on the bumblebee bombus","Abstract: Azadirachtin is a biorational insecticide commonly reported as selective"

Here, we establish proof-of-concept for a prototype long-range, passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging system for detecting bumblebees and similar sized insects. The prototype tags, weighing 81 mg (49% of mean bee body weight), were flown by bumblebees in a glasshouse and detected at a distance of 1.5 m from a 2 W UHF reader with two aerials. This detection distance is two orders of magnitude greater than existing RFID tags that can be flown by medium-sized bees and, thus, is a significant breakthrough for insect tracking that could be applied to plant conservation and restoration efforts in fragmented landscapes. Proof-of-concept has been successfully established and, with further development, we are likely to optimize the system by reducing tag size and weight to limit effects on bee behaviour, and by increasing the detection distance. We envisage the production system being used to detect and track bee movement pathways within a designed network of field-deployed low-cost readers and aerials.

Recent work suggests that bees measure distance flown in terms of the extent of image motion (integrated optic flow) that is experienced during flight. However, it is known that optic flow also regulates the speed of flight. Therefore, the duration of the flight to a destination is likely to co-vary with the optic flow that is experienced en route. This makes it difficult to tease apart the potential roles of flight duration and optic flow as cues in estimating distance flown. Here we examine whether flight duration alone can serve as an indicator of distance. We trained bees to visit feeders at two sites located in optically different environments, but positioned such that the flight durations to the two sites were similar. The distance estimates for the two sites, as reported in the waggle dance, were compared. We found that dances differed significantly between the two sites, even though flight times were similar. Flight time per se was a poor predictor of waggle dance behaviour. We conclude that foraging bees do not simply signal flight time as their measure of distance in the waggle dance; the environment through which they fly plays a dominant role. © Birkhäuser Verlag, 2005.","influence of flight time and flight environment on distance communication","Forager honey bees communicate the distance of food sources to"

The feeding of workers at feeders was monitored during consecutive days under these variable resource conditions. Scouts marked all the sugar-solution feeders with a visible fluid, and the degree of marking and nestmate recruitment was positively correlated with sugar concentration. Workers exhibited characteristics of the group-foraging behaviour termed 'opportunism', whereby many foragers search independently in the field, until one of them finds an exceptional sugar-solution resource and then rapidly recruits nestmates. Overall, workers preferred the 40% sugar feeders, visitation rates decreased with increasing distance from the nest, and visits at the 20 and 10% feeders increased in that sequence when replenishment with sugar solution was interrupted and sugar concentrations declined progressively in the 40 and 20% feeders. These results show that workers have the physiological ability to identify the richest sugar solutions, but indicate that food choice will vary with resource variability. The evidence suggests that the primary strategy involved in the foraging behaviour of this species is to optimise the feeding intake of the colony.","foraging behaviour of trigona carbonaria (hymenoptera : apidae) at multiple-choice","To examine the foraging behaviour of the stingless bee Trigona"

Although the short-lived plant Aquilegia canadensis produces large, complex, nectar-rich flowers, 75% of seed, on average, are self-fertilized. Previous experimental results are consistent with the fine-scale SGS expected in selfing populations. In contrast, key floral traits show no evidence of SGS, despite a significant genetic basis to phenotypic variation within populations. In this study, we attempt to resolve these contradictory results by hierarchically sampling plants from two plots nested within each of seven rock outcrops distributed over several km, and comparing the spatial pattern of phenotypic variation in four floral traits with neutral genetic variation at 10 microsatellite loci. For both floral and microsatellite variation, we detected only weak hierarchical structuring and no isolation by distance. The spatial pattern of variation in floral traits was on par with microsatellite polymorphisms. These results suggest regular long-distance gene flow via pollen. At much finer spatial scales within plots, estimates of relatedness were higher (albeit very low) between nearest neighbors than random plants, and declined with increasing distance between neighbors, which is consistent with highly localized seed dispersal. High selfing should yield SGS, but strong inbreeding depression in A. canadensis likely erodes SGS so that reproductive plants exhibit weak structure typical of outcrossers, especially given that outcrossing and consequent gene flow in this species are mediated by strong-flying hummingbirds and bumble bees. © 2018, The Genetics Society.","lack of spatial structure for phenotypic and genetic variation despite","By reducing genetically effective population size and gene flow, self-fertilization"

However, Eurasian columbines show similar taxonomic diversity despite to be mainly pollinated by bumblebees. This situation makes Eurasian columbines an ideal counterpoint to explore diversification process under low pollinator diversity but high environmental heterogeneity scenarios. In this paper we explore diversification rates and patterns of habitat (habitat and altitudinal range) transitions underlying the European columbines evolution. A density-dependent lineal model of diversification best fitted our data, which implies a lineal decrease of diversification rate through radiation. Our results point to an important role of habitat (14.3-15.8 habitat transitions) in driving European columbines diversification. Habitat and altitudinal range reconstruction showed a pattern from wide altitudinal range (encompassing 1000-1200 m) and generalist ancestors to narrow altitudinal ranges (= 800 m) and open-rocky habitats in more recent taxa (i.e. those species inhabiting mountains regions of South Europe). Ecological opportunity has been the preferred explanation for density-dependence diversification during a radiation. Glacial impacts on European flora and the coincidence of the initiation of the radiation with the onset of Mediterranean climate probably did generate ecological opportunities for niche expansion and habitat specialization and evolution. However, we suggest that some biological features of Aquilegia (low seed dispersal, small population sizes and frequent inbreeding depression) unrelated to ecological opportunity together with the orography might also be involved in density-dependent speciation and habitat evolution in this genus. Specifically, we propose that high geographical isolation between and within distinct South European peninsulas, restricted geographical range size and specialization on open-rocky habitats combined with low seed dispersal might have contributed to the density-dependence mode of diversification in European columbines.","habitat transitions and patterns of diversification of the genus aquilegia","Genus Aquilegia in North America has become a recurrent example"

Habitat degradation, destruction and fragmentation due to agricultural intensification have historically been the main causes of this pollinator decline. However, despite increasing and accelerating levels of global urbanization, very little research has investigated the effects of urbanization on pollinator assemblages. We assessed changes in the diversity, abundance and species composition of bee and hoverfly pollinator assemblages in urban, suburban, and rural sites across a UK city. Methodology/Principal Findings: Bees and hoverflies were trapped and netted at 24 sites of similar habitat character (churchyards and cemeteries) that varied in position along a gradient of urbanization. Local habitat quality (altitude, shelter from wind, diversity and abundance of flowers), and the broader-scale degree of urbanization (e. g. percentage of built landscape and gardens within 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, 1 km, and 2.5 km of the site) were assessed for each study site. The diversity and abundance of pollinators were both significantly negatively associated with higher levels of urbanization. Assemblage composition changed along the urbanization gradient with some species positively associated with urban and suburban land-use, but more species negatively so. Pollinator assemblages were positively affected by good site habitat quality, in particular the availability of flowering plants. Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that urban areas can support diverse pollinator assemblages, but that this capacity is strongly affected by local habitat quality. Nonetheless, in both urban and suburban areas of the city the assemblages had fewer individuals and lower diversity than similar rural habitats. The unique development histories of different urban areas, and the difficulty of assessing mobile pollinator assemblages in just part of their range, mean that complementary studies in different cities and urban habitats are required to discover if these findings are more widely applicable.","changing bee and hoverfly pollinator assemblages along an urban-rural gradient","Background: The potential for reduced pollination ecosystem service due to"

For this purpose, we developed a mechanistic, energetics-based model for a single day of nectar foraging in complex landscape mosaics. Net energetic efficiency determined resource patch choice. In one version of the model a single optimal patch was selected each hour. In another version, recruitment of foragers was simulated and several patches could be exploited simultaneously. Resource availability changed during the day due to depletion and/or intrinsic properties of the resource (anthesis). The model accounted for the impact of patch distance and size, resource depletion and replenishment, competition with other nectar foragers, and seasonal and diurnal patterns in availability of nectar-providing crops and wild flowers. From the model we derived simple rules for resource patch selection, e.g., for landscapes with mass-flowering crops only, net energetic efficiency would be proportional to the ratio of the energetic content of the nectar divided by distance to the hive. We also determined maximum distances at which resources like oilseed rape and clover were still energetically attractive. We used the model to assess the potential for pesticide exposure dilution in landscapes of different composition and complexity. Dilution means a lower concentration in nectar arriving at the hive compared to the concentration in nectar at a treated field and can result from foraging effort being diverted away from treated fields. Applying the model for all possible hive locations over a large area, distributions of dilution factors were obtained that were characterised by their 90-percentile value. For an area for which detailed spatial data on crops and off-field semi-natural habitats were available, we tested three landscape management scenarios that were expected to lead to exposure dilution: providing alternative resources than the target crop (oilseed rape) in the form of (i) other untreated crop fields, (ii) flower strips of different widths at field edges (off-crop in-field resources), and (iii) resources on off-field (semi-natural) habitats. For both model versions, significant dilution occurred only when alternative resource patches were equal or more attractive than oilseed rape, nearby and numerous and only in case of flower strips and off-field habitats. On an area-base, flower strips were more than one order of magnitude more effective than off-field habitats, the main reason being that flower strips had an optimal location. The two model versions differed in the predicted number of resource patches exploited over the day, but mainly in landscapes with numerous small resource patches. In landscapes consisting of few large resource patches (crop fields) both versions predicted the use of a small number of patches. ï¿½ 2016 Baveco et al.","an energetics-based honeybee nectar-foraging model used to assess the potential","Estimating the exposure of honeybees to pesticides on a landscape"

An individual-based model then determines the detection probabilities of the food patches by bees, based on parameter values gathered from the flight patterns of radar-tracked honeybees and bumblebees. Various “search modes” describe hypothetical search strategies for the long-range exploration of scouting bees. The resulting detection probabilities of forage patches can be used as input for the recently developed honeybee model BEEHAVE, to explore realistic scenarios of colony growth and death in response to different stressors. In example simulations, we find that detection probabilities for food sources close to the colony fit empirical data reasonably well. However, for food sources further away no empirical data are available to validate model output. The simulated detection probabilities depend largely on the bees’ search mode, and whether they exchange information about food source locations. Nevertheless, we show that landscape structure and connectivity of food sources can have a strong impact on the results. We believe that BEESCOUT is a valuable tool to better understand how landscape configurations and searching behaviour of bees affect detection probabilities of food sources. It can also guide the collection of relevant data and the design of experiments to close knowledge gaps, and provides a useful extension to the BEEHAVE honeybee model, enabling future users to explore how landscape structure and food availability affect the foraging decisions and patch visitation rates of the bees and, in consequence, to predict colony development and survival. © 2016","beescout: a model of bee scouting behaviour and a software","Social bees are central place foragers collecting floral resources from"

Such recruitment is particularly profitable if the source is plentiful and ephemeral, or too large to be transported by a single individual. Ants, termites and some social bees and wasps use pheromones as recruitment signals. Such signals are excreted by individuals that have located a profitable food source, and are deposited on the ground as a continuous trail (ants and termites), left on prominent vegetation (stingless bees), or at the actual food source (some bees and wasps). When recruitment signals are left in the open, others can also eavesdrop on the information. Some social insects therefore have moved their recruitment signaling inside the nest. The most primitive form of in-house recruitment are probably the excitatory movements performed by returning foragers, who often also carry the odor of the food source on them. The most sophisticated form of recruitment is found in honeybees, where the so-called waggle dance conveys directional and distance information to nestmates. Many social insects further use recruitment signals when selecting a new home, but information on nest site selection is scarce, mainly restricted to honeybees and some species of ants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","telling your friends where the goodies are - recruitment signals","Social organisms have evolved a myriad of mechanisms to recruit"

The 'tuned-error' hypothesis suggests that colonies benefit from this imprecision as it spreads recruits out over a patch of constant size irrespective of the distance to the advertised site. An alternative to the tuned-error hypothesis is that dancers are physically incapable of dancing with great precision for nearby sources. Here we revisit the tuned-error hypothesis by studying the change in dance precision with increasing foraging distance over relatively short distances while controlling for environmental influences. We show that bees indeed increase their dance precision with the increase in foraging distance. However, we also show that dances performed by swarm-scouts for a nearby (30 m) nest site, where there could be no benefit to imprecision, are either without or with only limited directional information.

When foraging, all species face an identical problem: conveying information about profitable floral patches. However, profound differences in nesting biology (some nest in cavities while others nest in the open, often on a branch or a cliff face) may mean that species have different requirements when dancing to advertise new nest sites. In cavity nesting species, nest sites are a precise location in the landscape: usually a small opening leading to a cavity in a hollow tree. Dances for cavities therefore need to be as precise as possible. In contrast, when the potential nest site comprises a tree or perhaps seven a patch of trees, precision is less necessary. Similarly, when a food patch is advertised, dances need not be very precise, as floral patches are often large, unless they are so far away that recruits need more precise information to be able to locate them. In this paper, we study the dance precision of the open-nesting red dwarf bee Apis florea. By comparing the precision of dances for food sources and nest sites, we show that A. florea workers dance with the same imprecision irrespective of context. This is in sharp contrast with the cavity-nesting Apis mellifera that increases the precision of its dance when advertising a potential new home. We suggest that our results are in accordance with the hypothesis that the honeybees' dance communication initially evolved to convey information about new nest sites and was only later adapted for the context of foraging. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","dance precision of apis florea - clues to the evolution","All honeybee species make use of the waggle dance to"

This waggle dance is used by successful foragers to convey information about both the direction and distance to food sources. Nest mates can use this spatial information, increasing their chances of locating the food source. But how effective is the bees' dance communication? Previous work has shown that dancing does not benefit a honeybee colony under all foraging conditions and that the benefits of dancing are small. We used an individual-based simulation model to investigate under which foraging conditions it pays to dance. We compared the net nectar intake of 3 types of colonies: 1) colonies that use dance communication; 2) colonies that did dance but could not use the dance's spatial information; and 3) colonies that did not dance. Our results show that dancing is beneficial when the probability of independent discovery of food sources is low. Low independent discovery rates occur when patches are very small or very far away. Under these conditions, dancing is beneficial as only a single individual needs to find a patch for the whole colony to benefit. The main benefit of the honeybee's dance communication, however, seems to be that it enables the colony to forage at the most profitable patches only, ignoring forage patches that are of low quality. Thus, dancing allows the colony to rapidly exploit high-quality patches, thereby preventing both intra- and interspecific competitors from using that same patch. © The Author 2007.

Studies on the dance precision of Apis mellifera have shown that the dance is often imprecise. Two hypotheses have been put forward aimed at explaining this imprecision. The first argues that imprecision in the context of foraging is adaptive as it ensures that the dance advertises the same patch size irrespective of distance. The second argues that the bees are constrained in their ability to be more precise, especially when the source is nearby. Recent studies have found support for the latter hypothesis but not for the ""tuned-error"" hypothesis, as the adaptive hypothesis became known. Here we investigate intra-dance variation among Apis species. We analyse the dance precision of A. florea, A. dorsata, and A. mellifera in the context of foraging and swarming. A. mellifera performs forage dances in the dark, using gravity as point of reference, and in the light when dancing for nest sites, using the sun as point of reference. Both A. dorsata and A. florea are open-nesting species; they do not use a different point of reference depending on context. A. florea differs from both A. mellifera and A. dorsata in that it dances on a horizontal surface and does not use gravity but instead ""points"" directly toward the goal when indicating direction. Previous work on A. mellifera has suggested that differences in dance orientation and point of reference can affect dance precision. We find that all three species improve dance precision with increasing waggle phase duration, irrespective of differences in dance orientation, and point of reference. When dancing for sources nearby, dances are highly variable. When the distance increases, dance precision converges. The exception is dances performed by A. mellifera on swarms. Here, dance precision decreases as the distance increases. We also show that the size of the patch advertised increases with increasing distance, contrary to what is predicted under the tuned-error hypothesis. © 2015 Beekman, Makinson, Couvillon, Preece and Schaerf.","honeybee linguistics-a comparative analysis of the waggle dance among species","All honeybees use the waggle dance to recruit nestmates.

We also asked which vegetation type or complex plays the most important role as a pollen or nectar resource for wild bees, and what conclusions can be drawn for nature conservation. The vegetation types or complexes range from basiphytic pioneer stages to consolidated basiphytic to slightly acidophytic grasslands (classes Koelerio-Corynephoretea and Festuco-Brometea): Koelerion glaucae complex (1), Armerio-Festucetum trachyphyllae (2a, typical; 2b, ruderalized), ruderalized ex-arable field (3), and Allio-Stipetum capillatae (4). We used a plot-based approach for recording vegetation data and flower-visiting wild bees. Releves were sampled and flower-visiting bees netted on defined flower resources (2004, 2005). Data were analyzed by ordination, mixed linear models and regression analysis. Phytosociological table and DCA show clear floristic differentiations between the vegetation types and complexes. For the bee data there were weaker species-based differentiations. In the year 2004 there were two bee assemblages, in the year 2005 this differentiation was not detectable. The most species- and individual-rich wild-bee populations were detected in the vegetation types 2b, 3 and 4. These types were characterized by a high diversity of entomophilous plant species in combination with high flower density. Although ruderalized sandy grasslands have only moderate conservation value based on vegetation characteristics, they offer remarkable resources for species-rich populations of wild bees. Important flower resources for endangered wild-bee species are, among others, Centaurea stoebe s.l., Berteroa incana and Carduus nutans.

In this study, we use an individual-based model of pollinator foraging economics to predict how visitation rates and pollination success of two coflowering plant species change with their frequency (relative abundance). Whereas previous studies suggested that adaptive foraging of pollinators always favors pollination of abundant plant species (positive frequency dependence), here we show that under certain conditions the per capita pollination success of a rare plant species can exceed that of a more abundant species. Specifically, when the overall flower density is sufficiently high and pollinators' perception ranges are sufficiently large, animals with limited memory of previously encountered rewards forage in a way that favors pollination of the rarer plant species. Moreover, even with perfectly informed foragers, a rare plant species benefits more from offering a higher floral reward than a more abundant species. Our results show that adaptive foraging of individual pollinators can have important implications for plant community dynamics and the persistence of rare plant species.","adaptive foraging of pollinators can promote pollination of a rare","Most pollinators have the foraging flexibility to visit a wide"

Within one lineage of solitary wasp parasites, parallel switch to digger wasps (Sphecidae) occurred independently in the New World and Old World regions. The biogeography and macroevolutionary history of Xenidae can be explained by the combination of dispersal, lineage extinction and climatic changes during the Cenozoic era. A habitable Antarctica and the presence of now-submerged islands and plateaus that acted as a connection between the New World and Old World + Australia provided the possibility for biotic exchanges of parasites along with their hymenopteran hosts.

The impact of air temperature proved to be the most important of the weather conditions. Rising temperature significantly increases the speed of flower visits and simultaneously decreases the number of flowers visited per inflorescence. Sky covered has slight reserved effect whilst light wind (below 4.5 m per sec) and flight distance within 600 metres do not affect the foraging rates of honeybees on red clover inflorescences. Strong wind decreases the speed of flower visits or prevents it. It is concluded that increasing length of corolla tube and decreasing amount and/or availability of nectar affect adversely the flower visiting speed. The type of behaviour is also important, since pure pollen gatherers are much more rapid flower visitors than the remaining behavioural classes whose foraging rates are closely similar to each other at the same locality. The details suggest that the foraging rates of honeybees are governed by a host of factors none of which seem to be highly superior to the others. For this reason, the foraging rates of honeybees are always affected by a complex system of factors individual components of which can partly interfere with or support each other, however, certain factors tend to have geographical tendencies.

There was a significant negative correlation between the amount of nectar and its sugar concentration, but no definite difference was established between the ne ctar production of quince cultivars. In spite of this, bee visitation was highly intense about 5.5 bee visits were counted on average at 50 open quince flowers in 10 minutes and about 9.7 flowers out of 50 were visited. This equals about 7 bee visits per flower per day in good weather. Some cultivars tended to be more and less visited by honeybees. Most honeybees tended to collect pollen (51.6 % in average for the 3 years) and usually fewer gathered only nectar (19.9 %), while the rest had a mixed foraging behaviour gathering both (28.5 %). There were slight differences in the foraging behaviour of honeybees on some cultivars, but these differences were not always consequent in consecutive years. Quince is highly sensitive to partial and/or complete limitation of the insect (bee) pollination period. Complete limitation of insect pollination resulted in no yield and partial limitation of the insect pollination period depressed the final set and yield by at least 60-70 % or more. Significant correlation was established between the intensity of honeybee visitation and the consequent yield of quince.

Additionally, suites of behavioural traits are often correlated, forming behavioural syndromes in both humans and other species. Such syndromes are often described by testing for variation in traits across commonly described dimensions (e. g. aggression and neophobia), independent of whether this variation is ecologically relevant to the focal species. Here, we use a variety of ecologically relevant behavioural traits to test for a colony-level behavioural syndrome in rock ants (Temnothorax rugatulus). Specifically, we combine field and laboratory assays to measure foraging effort, how colonies respond to different types of resources, activity level, response to threat and aggression level. We find evidence for a colony level syndrome that suggests colonies consistently differ in coping style-some are more risk-prone, whereas others are more risk-averse. Additionally, by collecting data across the North American range of this species, we show that environmental variation may affect how different populations maintain consistent variation in colony behaviour.","be meek or be bold? a colony-level behavioural syndrome in","Consistent individual variation in animal behaviour is nearly ubiquitous and"

Native insect pollinators depend on natural or semi-natural land surrounding farms for nesting and alternative foraging resources. Despite interest in conserving pollinators through habitat restoration, the scale at which land use affects pollinators and thus crop pollination services is not well understood. We measured abundance of native, wild bee pollinators and the pollination services they provided to highbush blueberry Vaccinium corymbosum L. crops at 16 sites that varied in the proportion of surrounding agricultural land cover at both the field scale (300-m radius) and the landscape scale (1500-m radius). We designed our study such that agricultural land cover at the field scale was uncorrelated with agricultural cover at the landscape scale across sites. We used model selection to determine which spatial scale better predicted aggregate bee abundance, abundance of large versus small bees and crop pollination services. We found that, overall, bees responded more strongly to field-scale than to landscape-scale land cover, but the scale at which land cover had the strongest effect varied by bee body size. Large bees showed a negative response to increasing agricultural cover at both scales, but were most strongly affected by the landscape scale. Small bees were negatively affected by agricultural land cover but only at the field scale, while they had a small positive response to agricultural cover at the landscape scale. Aggregate pollination services from native bees were more strongly influenced by field-scale agricultural cover, due to the combined effects of both large and small bees responding at that scale.Synthesis and applications. Bee abundance and pollination services were strongly determined by field-scale agricultural cover, suggesting that field-scale set-asides may provide significant benefits to pollination services. Further, we found that pollinators respond differently to land use depending on body size, but all groups of bees benefit from decreasing agricultural cover at the field scale. Therefore, small-scale modifications to habitat can have significant impacts on both pollinator abundance and pollination services to crop plants.

Pollen samples taken from 40 bees at each of two nest sites were identified using a pollen reference collection from the sites. Bees were collecting pollen from both native and exotic plants.

Individual bees usually specialised in a few pollen types, with 74% of bees having >90% of a single pollen type and a mean of 2.6 pollen types per bee. The minimum flight distances to the nearest sources of each pollen type were typically 70-250 m. These easily overlooked bees may be assisting more in general pollination services given the diversity of plant taxa from which the bees were collecting pollen, the variation from bee to bee in the plant taxa collected, and the sometimes considerable minimum foraging distances exhibited.","food plants and foraging distances for the native bee &itlasioglossum","With concerns about declines in pollinating bee species worldwide, there"

Much of this deviation can be explained through differences in the characteristics of the flower patch, but not all. We suggest that the position of the flower patch within the landscape can have strong effects on bee patch use, independent of the characteristics of the flower patch, through changes in access to nesting resources and the microclimate. Further, the effects of different habitat configurations are likely to vary among bee groups, depending on flight distances and resource requirements. We surveyed local habitat and plant community characteristics around 100 observation plots in native grassland within temperate savannah and recorded bee patch use by direct observation. Using structural equation modeling, we quantified the direct and indirect effect of plant community and habitat configuration on patch use for all bees, only bumblebees, and only non-bumblebees. Our models explained nearly 50% of the variation in bee patch use, with equal importance assigned to local habitat configuration and the plant community. Flower abundance was the best indicator of patch use, followed by distance to forest edge, site productivity and proportion forest cover. Contrary to previous findings, flower diversity had weak, yet negative effects on patch use after accounting for covariance with other factors. Although all bees most frequently visited plots with high flower densities, bumblebees preferentially used edge habitats, while non-bumblebees were mostly found in productive grassland areas with access to forest habitat. Our results show that small-scale habitat configuration can have direct effects on bee patch use as strong as or stronger than those of the flower patch itself. Further, the exact habitat configuration that drives bee patch choices is likely to vary among groups. This suggests that habitat configuration should be considered in bee conservation efforts. © 2014 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","small-scale bee patch use is affected equally by flower availability","Bee foraging is complex and observed patterns often deviate from"

The type of biofuel crop selected for production has the capacity to substantially alter landscape composition, affecting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. To understand how increasing production of perennial grasses for biofuels may affect pollinators and pollination services, we identified 20 agricultural fields that varied in their proportion of surrounding grassland cover. Bees and pollination services were measured at each site to determine how bee abundance, diversity, and community composition responded to increasing proportions of grassland, and to quantify how pollination services changed as the proportion of grassland increased in the landscape. Bees were collected from sentinel sunflowers, and pollination services were measured by comparing seed set from open and closed sunflowers at each site. Landscape composition had a significant effect on bee abundance, diversity, and community composition with a greater abundance of bees and a more diverse bee community found visiting flowers at sites with more of the surrounding landscape in perennial grassland. In contrast, the bee community in low grassland sites was dominated by Apis mellifera, suggesting that pollination in these landscapes may be more sensitive to declines in this species. Despite these differences, the level of sunflower pollination was similar across sites, even though the bee community responded to changes in landscape composition. Increasing grassland cover through the addition of perennial biofuel plantings would be expected to support a more diverse bee community and a greater abundance of bees, yielding reliable pollination services.

Urban agricultural sites are a growing component of urban landscapes and have potential to serve as a source of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provisioning in urban areas. In 19 urban agricultural sites, we investigated how surrounding land cover and local site variables supported bees and pollination services. We found the abundance of bees differentially responded to landscape and local scale variables depending on body size and nesting habit. Large-bodied bees, Bombus and Apis species, were positively associated with increasing amounts of impervious cover, while the abundance of small-bodied soil nesting Halictus species increased as the proportion of flower area, a local variable, increased. Bee richness declined with increasing levels of impervious cover, while bee community composition changed along a gradient of increasing impervious cover. Pollination services, measured at each site using sentinel cucumber plants, declined as hardscape, a local variable, increased. To improve bee conservation and pollination services in urban agricultural sites, our results suggest urban planning strategies should minimize impervious cover at large spatial scales while land managers should focus locally on incorporating floral resources, which increases food and nesting resources especially for smaller bee species. Local site design coupled with regional urban planning can advance the success of urban agriculture, while benefiting biodiversity by creating opportunities for pollinator conservation in urban landscapes.","landscape and local site variables differentially influence pollinators and pollination","Urbanization has detrimental effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, as"

The yellow spots were procured from the surface of a number of leaves and other objects from three different localities of Lucknow District of Uttar Pradesh. The size and shapes of these spots vary, ranging from linear to circular. Pollen grains recovered in good frequencies chiefly belong to angiosperms, whereas some gymnosperm pollen was also observed in trace frequencies. Other microbiota include fern spores, fungal remains and insect body parts in lower values. The study broadly suggests that palynomorphs recovered from yellow droppings are not fully airborne; rather, they are the types that honey bees gather from crop fields to feed their young. Brassica campestris and Asteroideae are the dominant plant taxa recorded in yellow rain samples. On investigation, it was noticed that yellow drop falling occurred for a few minutes on limited days during the summer of 2014, when the atmosphere experienced optimal temperature conditions with relatively humid environs. The observation also confirms that the yellow spots are nothing but faecal droppings, as suggested by the bee faeces theory which proposed that the origin of yellow rain is a phenomenon of nature. The study, in addition to aiding in understanding yellow rain occurrence, could also be helpful in aerobiological research, especially in examining the allergenicity of various pollen grains/spores in the area of investigation, causing bronchial asthma, hay fever (allergic rhinitis/pollinosis), nasobronchial allergy and other respiratory disorders along with conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, food allergies and other health ailments. A multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to quantified data obtained from pollen frequency analyses of different areas of Lucknow, which clearly revealed a significant group variation in vegetation type on the basis of dispersal and deposition of pollen in yellow spots.","pollen and spores in yellow rain from lucknow, northern india","This paper presents the results of pollen and spore concentration"

We genotyped 376 adult coffee shrubs and 418 progenies from three natural unmanaged, and three highly managed coffee populations, using 24 microsatellite markers. Mating system analysis of C. arabica yielded an overall multilocus outcrossing rate of 76%, which contrasts with the common knowledge that C. arabica is a predominantly selfing species. In highly managed coffee populations, paternity could be assigned to 78% of the progenies, whereas in the unmanaged natural coffee populations, only 57% of the progenies could be assigned to a father, indicating reduced long-distance pollen dispersal in managed forests. Furthermore, the fraction of selfed progenies was significantly higher in managed (23%) than unmanaged (10%) coffee forests. Finally, the lack of spatial genetic structure in all studied populations suggests high seed dispersal in unmanaged populations, and intense berry harvesting and coffee planting in the managed populations.

In social insects, behavioural changes are often particularly conspicuous. For example, in many ant species, reproductive sexuals leave their maternal nests and engage in risky mating and dispersal activities. Female sexuals experience, during a short period of time, dramatic changes in terms of behaviour and environmental conditions. But because sexual activities of ants are not easily observed, few studies have quantified in detail how behaviour alters with maturation and mating. We studied how various behavioural traits of Leptothorax gredleri female sexuals, a species in which female sexuals attract males by female calling', change before and after mating. We tested the hypothesis that behavioural variation reflects the altered requirements of queens to adapt to a particular situation. To this end, we compared geotactic, phototactic and locomotor behaviour across a wide range of life stages from lightly coloured, unmated female sexuals to old, mated queens. The results showed that female sexuals of L.gredleri change conspicuously their geotactic, phototactic and locomotor behavioural traits over their life stages. Three different behavioural states were evident (1) from light to dark female sexuals, individuals have negative phototaxis and reduced locomotor activity; (2) mature female sexuals during the daily period of sexual activity have strong phototaxis, negative geotaxis and an important locomotor activity; and (3) freshly mated and old mated queens avoid light and decrease their locomotor activity. These sharp differences in behaviour between stages match the transition from the relative safety of the nest chamber to the adversary world outside the nest, and back.","mating-associated changes in the behaviour of leptothorax gredleri ant queens","Throughout their lives, animals adapt their behaviour to environmental fluctuations"

Clonal ants allow the study of which factors influence task allocation without confounding variation in genotype and morphology. Here, we subjected larvae and freshly hatched workers of the clonal ant Platythyrea punctata to different rearing conditions and investigated how these manipulations affected division of labour among pairs of oppositely treated, same-aged clonemates. High rearing temperature, physical stress, injury and malnutrition increased the propensity of individuals to become subordinate foragers rather than dominant reproductives. This is reflected in changed gene regulation: early stages of division of labour were associated with different expression of genes involved in nutrient signalling pathways, metabolism and the phenotypic response to environmental stimuli. Many of these genes appear to be capable of responding to a broad range of stressors. They might link environmental stimuli to behavioural and phenotypic changes and could therefore be more broadly involved in caste differentiation in social insects. Our experiments also shed light on the causes of behavioural variation among genetically identical individuals.","stress and early experience underlie dominance status and division of","Cooperation and division of labour are fundamental in the 'major"

More specifically, each bee is set to move according to individual strategies and social interactions, the former involving the desire to reach a target destination, the latter accounting for repulsive/attractive stimuli and for alignment processes. The insects tend in fact to remain sufficiently close to the rest of the population, while avoiding collisions, and they are able to track and synchronize their movement to the flight of a given set of neighbors within their visual field. The resulting collective behavior of the bee cloud therefore emerges from non-local short/long-range interactions. Differently from similar approaches present in the literature, we here test different alignment mechanisms (i.e., based either on an Euclidean or on a topological neighborhood metric), which have an impact also on the other social components characterizing insect behavior. A series of numerical realizations then shows the phenomenology of the swarm (in terms of pattern configuration, collective productive movement, and flight synchronization) in different regions of the space of free model parameters (i.e., strength of attractive/repulsive forces, extension of the interaction regions). In this respect, constraints in the possible variations of such coefficients are here given both by reasonable empirical observations and by analytical results on some stability characteristics of the defined pairwise interaction kernels, which have to assure a realistic crystalline configuration of the swarm. An analysis of the effect of unconscious random fluctuations of bee dynamics is also provided.","a discrete particle model reproducing collective dynamics of a bee","In this article, we present a microscopic discrete mathematical model"

Volume and sugar concentration of samples from individual flowers were measured and the sugar contained was calculated. The rate of sugar production remains constant for all ambient humidities and extraction intervals investigated; the mean value for all 180 samples is 1.55 mg sucrose equivalents/24h.

The consequences of the results for nectar production and nectar reward of individual flowers in the field and for the optimal foraging of pollinators are discussed.

Microsatellite genotyping at 14 loci of all adult E. caesia at two populations (n = 580 and 315), followed by paternity analysis of 705 progeny, revealed contrasting results between populations. Honeyeater exclusion did not significantly impact pollen dispersal or plant mating at Mount Caroline. In contrast, at the Chiddarcooping site, the exclusion of honeyeaters led to lower outcrossing rates, a threefold reduction in the average number of sires per fruit, a decrease in intermediate-distance mating and an increase in near-neighbour mating. The results from Chiddarcooping suggest that bird pollination may increase paternal genetic diversity, potentially leading to higher fitness of progeny and favouring the evolution of this strategy. However, further experimentation involving additional trees and study sites is required to test this hypothesis.

The trial consisted of two identical strips (9 m x 45 m) along the forest ground-level discrete vegetation having herbaceous diversity. The design was a 'V', truncated in such a way that the zone, without any vegetation, between the two strips varied from 4.5 to 18 m in width. A nest of M. panamica colony was placed at 12 m from the top of the 'V'. Three equal sectors (135 m2) were identified in each strip. The bees were marked with different colours according to each sector of one strip, named the donor strip. Almost all bees were marked until their number was nearly balanced between the three sectors. Then, marked and unmarked bees were counted on the donor and recipient strips. Results showed that the foraging area in a given strip is about 405 m2 and that a mean proportion of 3.45% of marked bees/total number of bees in colony was recovered in the recipient strip. It was found that a barren zone from 4.5 to 18 m in width was not sufficient to completely discourage bees from crossing between two identical resources, but that it significantly reduced cross-pollination. The bees dispersed pollens by bee-bee interactions within the nest, showing high diversity of pollens from outgoing bees, rather than incoming ones. The pollen viability study along the body of exiting bees showed that the pollens remained viable (48-51 %) within the bee nest, indicating a possibility of out-crossing by exiting bees at the time of their forage patch and trip change.","novel mechanism of distance-oriented bee movement, secondary pollen dispersal and","The efficiency of secondary pollen dispersal, effect of distance isolation,"

Foraging patterns were determined by measuring the distance and direction of marked flowers from the nest box. While marked flowers were found out to 55 m (maximum distance sampled), most marked flowers were found within 35 m from the nest and the percentage of marked flowers declined rapidly beyond that distance.

Methods: We measured nectar production from male- and female-phase flowers across a range of display sizes. By experiment, we determined the effect of alternative nectar distributions on bumblebee foraging. We measured total flower production (male investment), seed production (female investment) and plant size. Results: Large floral displays allocated extra nectar production to female-phase flowers. Bumblebees probed fewer male-phase flowers per visit when extra nectar was added to female-phase flowers than when nectar was added more evenly among gender phases. Large plants produced about a third fewer flowers per gram of plant biomass than did the smallest plants. But large plants matured a nearly proportional number of seeds. © 2005 Jay M.

Experienced foragers and dance followers accounted for more than 93% of the shaking signals. Foraging success triggered shaking directly, during the next return to the hive, and indirectly, on the morning of the next day. Shaking occurred most often after the first foraging successes of the day and frequently following the first foraging success after a spell of bad weather. These findings confirm several hypotheses that predict that individual foraging success underlies colony-level patterns in shaking activity. Some results do not fit the previously suggested messages of the shaking signal. Therefore, I propose that the shaking signal has the very broad message: 'reassess your current activity'. This message can explain the wide range of contexts that trigger shaking while it acknowledges that the meaning of the signal depends entirely on the context of the recipient.","the occurrence and context of the shaking signal in honey","This study reports on the occurrence of the shaking signal"

This colony pattern was a result of the following individual behavioural decisions: continue foraging, abandon the feeder, restart foraging and initiate foraging. Only very rarely did individuals switch from one feeder to the other. With the first combination of a rich (2.7 M) and a poor (0.8 M) feeder M. fasciata behaved differently from Apis mellifera. Recruitment occurred to both feeders and the poor feeder was not abandoned completely. When the poor feeder was set to 0.4 M, M. fasciata abandoned the poor feeder rapidly and allocated more foragers to the rich feeder. These patterns were similar to those reported for A. mellifera with the first combination of feeders. Over a sequence of 4 days, experienced bees increasingly determined the colony patterns, and the major function of communication between workers became the reactivation of experienced foragers. The foragers modulated their behaviour not only according to the profitability of the feeder, but also according to previous experience with profitability switches. Thus, experience and communication together regulated colony foraging behaviour. These findings and the results of studies with honeybees suggest that M. fasciata and honeybees use similar decision-making mechanisms and only partly different tools.","social foraging in stingless bees: how colonies of melipona fasciata","In an experimental set-up, a colony of the stingless bee"

Furthermore, as interest in urban agriculture has grown, so has a need for studies of urban pollinator ecology and pollination. Analyzing pollinator assemblages along a rural-urban gradient provides powerful mechanistic insight into how urbanization impacts pollinators. Yet, studies examining pollinators along urban-rural gradients are limited and results vary. Since pollinators vary tremendously in life history characteristics and respond to urbanization differently, studies from different regions would improve our understanding of pollinator response to urbanization. This study documents different bee assemblages along a high-plains semi-arid urban-rural gradient in Denver, Colorado, USA. Percent impervious surface was used to define the extent of urbanization at 12 sites and local and landscape characteristics were estimated using field assessments and geospatial analysis. Wild bees were collected and the relationships between urbanization and bee communities were explored using linear modeling. Overall, bee abundance and diversity decreased with increasing urbanization, suggesting that urban areas negatively impact bee communities. However, all bee guilds responded positively to local floral richness and negatively to the degree of landscape urbanization, suggesting that different types of bees responded similarly to urbanization. These findings suggest that providing a greater diversity of floral resources is key to mitigating the negative impacts of urbanization on pollinator communities.","bee community response to local and landscape factors along an","Over a third of the world's crops require insect pollination,"

Birds allowed a 5-min preview of the surrounding landscape prior to release home faster than those denied access to such cues, suggesting that recognition is visually mediated. We examined this phenomenon further by asking how memory generated through prior experience with a site is used in recognition. We provided a group of homing pigeons with training experience in which they viewed, through a single transparent vertical face of an otherwise opaque release box, an approximately 140degrees segment of the landscape for 5 min before release. Training previews were always given from consistent locations and orientations within a release site. Test releases that followed were used to ascertain whether subsequent site recognition necessitated previewing from this already familiar angle and distance, or whether the skill could be extended to novel, nonoverlapping lateral views of the landscape. The results suggested that homing performance was better after presentation of the view recapitulating that seen during training than after showing a novel alternative view. Pigeons may have been using a template of the arrangement of familiar landmarks around the release site as the cue for recognition. The effect, however, disappeared after repeated training, suggesting that repeated release from a site may allow for more extensive visual survey and the memorization of detailed features of the landscape or the extraction of site-specific general features that aid recognition even when a novel view is presented.

Additionally, the numbers of the parasitoids Nomada lathburiana and Bombylius major were estimated. For calculations of the daily population size, the Jolly-Seber model for open populations with time-dependent survival and capture rates was used. The mean daily population size corresponded well to the number of nests marked in the aggregation of A. vaga. The method of mark-recapture achieved the most accurate data when the number of sampling periods and the capture probability was high. The results document a decrease in population size of the investigated A. vaga aggregation during 4 successive years. A population increase of its parasitoids B. major is considered to be one reason for the population decline of A. vaga in 1999. The sex ratio of A. vaga was biased toward females, contrary to the expected higher number of males. Results of the mark-recapture studies showed that up to 50% of females left the aggregation or died at the beginning of the season. The females probably colonized new aggregations at distances further than 200 m away from their birth aggregation, as no marked females were observed in the environs of the study area. This behavior is interpreted as a parasite avoidance strategy. The bee populations in the study area form a web of interconnected aggregations.

Operative temperature, which integrates air temperature, solar radiation and effects of wind, was estimated by measuring the temperature of a fresh, dead bee in the field environment.

Whereas parasite exposure is acknowledged as an important cause of these losses, the role of insecticides is controversial. Parasites and neonicotinoid insecticides reduce homing success of foragers (e.g. by reduced orientation), but it is unknown whether they negatively affect flight capacity. We investigated how exposing colonies to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid affect flight capacity of foragers. Flight distance, time and speed of foragers were measured in flight mills to assess the relative and interactive effects of high V. destructor load and a field-realistic, chronic sub-lethal dose of imidacloprid. Foragers from colonies exposed to high levels of V. destructor flew shorter distances, with a larger effect when also exposed to imidacloprid. Bee body mass partly explained our results as bees were heavier when exposed to these stressors, possibly due to an earlier onset of foraging. Our findings contribute to understanding of interacting stressors that can explain colony losses. Reduced flight capacity decreases the food-collecting ability of honeybees and may hamper the use of precocious foraging as a coping mechanism during colony (nutritional) stress. Ineffective coping mechanisms may lead to destructive cascading effects and subsequent colony collapse. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The present study investigated the dependence of haemolymph sugar levels in foraging honeybees on metabolic rate and whether the haemolymph sugar level is regulated. Free-flying foraging bees were trained to collect controlled amounts of sucrose solution of different concentrations (15 %, 30 % or 50 % sucrose w/w). Immediately after feeding, metabolic rate was measured over a given time depending on the sucrose concentration, then crop-emptying rate and haemolymph sugar levels were measured. Bees exhibiting a wide range of metabolic rates were compared to establish whether the observed differences in haemolymph sugar levels were due to limits in the supply of sugars from the crop or in the rate of trehalose synthesis in the fat bodies. Independent of the concentration of the sucrose solution supplied, haemolymph trehalose, glucose and fructose levels were constant for metabolic rates from 0 to 4.5ml CO2h-1. At higher metabolic rates, trehalose concentration decreased while that of glucose and fructose increased, with the exception of bees fed 15 % sucrose solution. As the supply of sugar from the crop via the proventriculus was sufficient to support even the highest metabolic rates, the observed pattern must result from an upper limit in the capacity of the fat body to synthesise trehalose. The maximal rate of conversion of glucose to trehalose in the fat body was therefore calculated to average 92.4 μg glucose min-1. However, for bees fed 15 % sucrose solution both the rate of conversion of glucose to trehalose and the rate of sugar transport from the crop to the ventricle were limited, together resulting in a decrease in total haemolymph sugar levels for metabolic rates higher than 5 ml CO2 h-1.","haemolymph sugar levels in foraging honeybees (apis mellifera carnica): dependence","Previous investigations of haemolymph sugar levels in honeybees have reported"

Because of the severity and unusual circumstances of these colony declines, scientists have named this phenomenon Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Reports indicate that beekeepers in 35 states have been affected. Overall, bee colony losses averaged about 30% in 2007. Reports for 2008 show continued declines with estimated average annual losses nationwide approaching 35%. Honey bees are the most economically valuable pollinators of agricultural crops worldwide. Many scientists at universities and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) frequently assert that bee pollination is involved in about one-third of the U.S. diet, and contributes to the production of a wide range of fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, forage crops, some field crops, and other specialty crops. The monetary value of honey bees as commercial pollinators in the United States is estimated at about $15 billion annually. Honey bee colony losses are not uncommon. However, current losses seem to differ from past situations in that colony losses are occurring mostly because bees are failing to return to the hive (which is largely uncharacteristic of bee behavior); bee colony losses have been rapid; colony losses are occurring in large numbers; and the reason(s) for these losses remains largely unknown. The potential causes of CCD, as reported by the scientists who are researching this phenomenon, include but maynot be limited to parasites, mites, and disease loads in the bees and brood; emergence of new or newly more virulent pathogens; poor nutrition among adult bees; lack of genetic diversity and lineage of bees; level of stress in adult bees (e.g., transportation and confinement of bees, overcrowding, or other environmental or biological stressors); chemical residue/contamination in the wax, food stores, and/or bees; a combination of these and/or other factors. In 2007, the House held two subcommittee hearings to review the recent honey bee colony declines and to address concerns about pollinator health. In 2008, the Senate hosted a briefing on pollinators and their role in agricultural security. Various policy options were discussed at these hearings and briefings, including increasing federal funding for research and monitoring, providing technical support and assistance for beekeepers, and emphasizing the importance of pollinator diversity and sustaining wild and native pollinator species. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We found that the genomes of ants, bees, and the wasp Nasonia vitripennis encode orthologous sequences indicating that OCLP1 is a conserved peptide and not unique to the honey bee. Search of available EST libraries and quantitative real time PCR analyses indicate that the transcript of AmOCLP1 is ubiquitous with expression in life stages ranging from embryos to adults and in all tested tissues. In worker honey bees AmOCLP1 expression was not associated with age or task and did not show clear enrichment in any of the tested tissues. There was however a consistent trend toward higher transcript levels in the abdomen of foragers relative to levels in the head or thorax, and compared to levels in the abdomen of younger worker bees. By contrast, in drones AmOCLP1 transcript levels appeared higher in the head relative to the abdomen. Finer analyses of the head and abdomen indicated that the AmOCLP1 transcript is not enriched in the stinger and the associated venom sac or in cephalic exocrine glands. The evolutionary conservation in the Hymenoptera, the ubiquitous expression, and the lack of enrichment in the venom gland, stinger, exocrine glands, and the brain are not consistent with the hypotheses that OCLP1 is a secreted honeybee toxin or an endotoxin acting in the central nervous system.

We quantified expression of the red imported fire ant foraging gene (sifor) in workers from 21 colonies collected across the natural range of Texas fire ant populations, but maintained under standardized, environmentally controlled conditions. Colonies varied significantly in their behaviour. The most active colonies had up to 10 times more active foragers than the least active colony and more than 16 times as many workers outside the nest. Expression differences among colonies correlated with this colony-level behavioural variation. Colonies with higher sifor expression in foragers had, on average, significantly higher foraging activity, exploratory activity and recruitment to nectar than colonies with lower expression. Expression of sifor was also strongly correlated with worker task (foraging vs. working in the interior of the nest). These results provide insight into the genetic and physiological processes underlying collective differences in social behaviour.

Cane toads are having a significant negative effect at the population level: at present, rainbow bee-eaters produce 0.8 fledglings per nest. However, in the absence of cane toads each nest would produce 1.2 fledglings. Rainbow bee-eaters had little defence against the cane toads. The diurnal birds were not able to mob the nocturnal toads, nor were they able to eject cane toads from the nest. Deep nests and nests built on steep slopes were still preyed upon by the toads. Cane toads that were removed from the nest had the ability and motivation to return to the nest when displaced up to 1200 m away, suggesting that the nest is a valuable resource to toads. Cane toads were significantly more likely to: (a) prey upon nests containing hatchlings rather than eggs; (b) enter and occupy artificial nest tunnels (1.2 in deep) containing a small food item (20 g of raw chicken) rather than artificial nests that were empty.

Associations among relatives appear to be facilitated by limited female dispersal, which results in viscous population structure. In addition, we found that per capita productivity declined with increasing group size, sex ratios were female-biased, and some female offspring apparently remained in their natal domicile for some time following eclosion. D. aneurae thus exhibits a suite of similarities with eusocial Hymenoptera, providing evidence for the convergent evolution of associated social and life-history traits in Hymenoptera and Thysanoptera. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","cofoundress relatedness and group productivity in colonies of social dunatothrips","Facultative joint colony founding by social insects provides opportunities to"

Average variance among flowers within plants was approximately one-third to one-half as great as variance among plants, with coefficients of variation among flowers ranging from 6.5% to 116.7%. A greenhouse experiment using clonally propagated ramets from field plants showed significant genetic variation for nectar production rates; broad sense heritability was estimated to have a maximum value of 0.64. In the greenhouse, plants grown under low water or low light conditions produced approximately 25% less nectar on average than those grown under control conditions. However, significant genotype-environment interactions indicated that genets differed in their responses to the changes in conditions. Rank correlations for genet mean nectar production rates across environmental conditions were low, and in two out of three comparisons were not different from zero. It is concluded that although the opportunity for natural selection on nectar production rates exits in this population, the response to selection will likely be slow, and the opportunity for selection of a narrow-optimum nectar production phenotype may be limited.","sources of variation in floral nectar production rate in epilobium","Sources of variation in floral nectar production were investigated in"

In this paper we investigate the effects of sub-lethal doses of imidacloprid on foraging activity and homing ability of honey bees. Honey bees from one hive were trained to forage on an artificial feeder filled with a 50% sucrose solution. The feeder was gradually moved up to a distance of 500 meters from the hive. Thirty bees, foraging on the sucrose solution, were captured, individually marked with coloured number tags and transferred into a flying cage, acting as control. The feeder was then replaced with a new one, filled with an imidacloprid supplemented sucrose solution. Again, thirty bees foraging on this feeder were captured, individually marked with different coloured number tags and transferred into an other flying cage. Three concentrations of imidacloprid were tested: 100 ppb, 500 ppb and 1000 ppb. The solutions at 500 ppb and 1000 ppb of imidacloprid had a repellent effect and the bees stopped visiting the feeder, hence only 10 and 20 honey bees, respectively, were captured for the two doses. Since the effects of imidacloprid start half an hour to one hour after ingestion, bees were released from the flying cage 1 hour after confinement. After the release, the behaviour of the bees was followed for 2 hours: two observers at the hive and one observer at the feeding site recorded the arrival and the departure of the marked bees. The presence of the bees at the hive and at the feeder was also recorded for one hour, 5 and 24 hours after the release. The results show that almost all the control honey bees returned to the hive, and started again visiting the feeder between 2 to 5 hours after the release. Honey bees fed with the concentration of 100 ppb also returned to the hive, but they returned to visit the feeder only 24 hours after the release. Honey bees fed with 500 ppb and 1000 ppb completely disappeared after the release, and they were not seen during the following 24 hours, neither at the hive nor at the feeding site.","effects of sub-lethal imidacloprid doses on the homing rate and","For several years, reports by French and Italian beekeepers have"

There is growing proof that bees are regularly exposed to mixtures of agrochemicals, but most research has been focused on managed bees living in farmland, whereas little is known about exposure of wild bees, both in farmland and urban habitats. To determine exposure of wild bumblebees to pesticides in agricultural and urban environments through the season, specimens of five different species were collected from farms and ornamental urban gardens in three sampling periods. Five neonicotinoid insecticides, thirteen fungicides and a pesticide synergist were analysed in each of the specimens collected. In total, 61% of the 150 individuals tested had detectable levels of at least one of the compounds, with boscalid being the most frequently detected (35%), followed by tebuconazole (27%), spiroxamine (19%), carbendazim (11%), epoxiconazole (8%), imidacloprid (7%), metconazole (7%) and thiamethoxam (6%). Quantifiable concentrations ranged from 0.17 to 54.4 ng/g (bee body weight) for individual pesticides. From all the bees where pesticides were detected, the majority (71%) had more than one compound, with a maximum of seven pesticides detected in one specimen. Concentrations and detection frequencies were higher in bees collected from farmland compared to urban sites, and pesticide concentrations decreased through the season. Overall, our results show that wild bumblebees are exposed to multiple pesticides when foraging in agricultural and urban landscapes. Such mixtures are detected in bee tissues not just during the crop flowering period, but also later in the season. Therefore, contact with these combinations of active compounds might be more prolonged in time and widespread in the environment than previously assumed. These findings may help to direct future research and pesticide regulation strategies to promote the conservation of wild bee populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These data were used to assess stability of the breeding program and the diversity levels of the contemporary breeding stock through comparison of POA values and genetic diversity parameters from the initial release to current values. POA values fluctuated throughout 2010-2016, but have recovered to statistically similar levels in 2016 (POA(2010)=0.82, POA(2016)=0.74; P=0.33).

The relationship among breeding lines, based on genetic distance measurement, was similar in 2008 and 2016 populations, but with increased homogeneity among lines (i.e., decreased genetic distance).

The blue orchard bee, Osmia lignaria (Say), is a commercially available native bee that can be employed as a copollinator with, or alternative pollinator to, honeybees in orchards. To date, their successful implementation in agriculture has been limited by poor recovery of bee progeny for use during the next spring. This lack of reproductive success may be tied to an inadequate diversity and abundance of alternative floral resources during the foraging period. Managed, supplementary wildflower plantings may promote O. lignaria reproduction in California almond orchards. Three wildflower plantings were installed and maintained along orchard edges to supplement bee forage. Plantings were seeded with native wildflower species that overlapped with and extended beyond almond bloom. We measured bee visitation to planted wildflowers, bee reproduction, and progeny outcomes across orchard blocks at variable distances from wildflower plantings during 2015 and 2016. Pollen provision composition was also determined to confirm O. lignaria wildflower pollen use. Osmia lignaria were frequently observed visiting wildflower plantings during, and after, almond bloom. Most O. lignaria nesting occurred at orchard edges. The greatest recovery of progeny occurred along the orchard edges having the closest proximity (80 m) to managed wildflower plantings versus edges farther away. After almond bloom, O. lignaria nesting closest to the wildflower plantings collected 72% of their pollen from Phacelia spp., which supplied 96% of the managed floral area. Phacelia spp. pollen collection declined with distance from the plantings, but still reached 17% 800 m into the orchard. This study highlights the importance of landscape context and proximity to supplementary floral resources in promoting the propagation of solitary bees as alternative managed pollinators in commercial agriculture.","wildflower plantings promote blue orchard bee, osmia lignaria (hymenoptera: megachilidae),","Concerns over the availability of honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) to"

We describe relatively simple and reliable methods for passively marking O. lignaria with egg albumin and casein powdered proteins combined with orange fluorescent powder as they emerge from cocoons. Marked adults were examined microscopically at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 days after emergence for the fluorescent powder followed by an anti-albumin and anti-casein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect the protein powders.

Osmia lignaria supplementation did not measurably increase cherry fruit set, fruit per limb cross-sectional area or fruit weight. The lack of differences in yield is likely a consequence of local saturation of pollinator services supplied by managed honey bees throughout experimental orchards, such that no additive benefit of managed O. lignaria releases were measurable. An increase in managed O. lignaria populations was achieved in 2017 but not 2018, possibly due to unknown changes to orchard management or environmental factors.

Some of these factors may lead to disparate or variable routes of exposure when compared to honey bees. For those that possess life histories that are distinct from A. mellifera, further risk assessments may be warranted.

However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting arthropod communities, and the extent to which they facilitate connectivity of these communities within the urban environment is currently largely unknown. We investigated the variation of species community composition (beta diversity) of four arthropod groups with contrasting mobility (Carabidae, Araneae, Curculionidae, and Apidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 extensively managed green sites on the ground in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. With redundancy analysis and variation partitioning, we (1) disentangled the relative importance of local environmental conditions, the surrounding land cover composition, and habitat connectivity on species community composition, (2) searched for specific spatial scales of habitat connectivity for the different arthropod groups, and (3) discussed the ecological and functional value of green roofs in cities. Our study revealed that on green roofs community composition of high-mobility arthropod groups (bees and weevils) were mainly shaped by habitat connectivity, while low-mobility arthropod groups (carabids and spiders) were more influenced by local environmental conditions. A similar but less pronounced pattern was found for ground communities. The high importance of habitat connectivity in shaping high-mobility species community composition indicates that these green roof communities are substantially connected by the frequent exchange of individuals among surrounding green roofs. On the other hand, low-mobility species communities on green roofs are more likely connected to ground sites than to other green roofs. The integration of green roofs in urban spatial planning strategies has great potential to enable higher connectivity among green spaces, so that eventually even communities of low-mobility species become connected. Furthermore, improving the design of green roofs (composition and configuration of vegetation and soil types) could enhance the ecological value, particularly for low-mobility species.","habitat connectivity shapes urban arthropod communities: the key role of","The installation of green roofs, defined here as rooftops with"

All adult trees (260) within a population of 40 ha and 9 isolated individuals on the edge of the reserve were sampled, and from these adults, 21 open-pollinated progeny arrays were analyzed in 2 flowering seasons (309 seeds in 2004 and 328 in 2005).

Maximum pollen dispersal was 2608 m, but most pollination events (65%) occurred at distances 300 m. Our results also showed that isolated individuals are sinking for pollen, with high pollen flow between the population inside the reserve and individuals on the edge.

The approximation disentangles the deterministic and stochastic element of local interaction and dispersal. We are thus able to understand the individual-based model through a simplified set of equations. In particular, we demonstrate that demographic noise leads to increased stability in the dynamics of locally dispersing single-species populations.

What bees see while navigating, depends on the appearance of the cues, the bee'current position, orientation, and movement relative to them. Here we analyze the detailed flight behavior during the localization of a goal surrounded by cylinders that are characterized either by a high contrast in luminance and texture or by mostly motion contrast relative to the background. By relating flight behavior to the nature of the information available from these landmarks, we aim to identify behavioral strategies that facilitate the processing of visual information during goal localization. We decompose flight behavior into prototypical movements using clustering algorithms in order to reduce the behavioral complexity. The determined prototypical movements reflect the honeybee's saccadic flight pattern that largely separates rotational from translational movements. During phases of translational movements between fast saccadic rotations, the bees can gain information about the 3D layout of their environment from the translational optic flow. The prototypical movements reveal the prominent role of sideways and up- or downward movements, which can help bees to gather information about objects, particularly in the frontal visual field. We find that the occurrence of specific prototypes depends on the bees' distance from the landmarks and the feeder and that changing the texture of the landmarks evokes different prototypical movements. The adaptive use of different behavioral prototypes shapes the visual input and can facilitate information processing in the bees' visual system during local navigation. © 2012 Braun, Dittmar, Boed-deker and Egelhaaf.","prototypical components of honeybee homing flight behavior depend on the","Honeybees use visual cues to relocate profitable food sources and"

Experiments were carried out during 3 years with 4 different colonies of the race Apis mellifica carnica. 62000 data of dances and the corresponding conditions in the environment of the bees during flight, at the artificial feeding places and in the hive were recorded. The direction of flight was both to the north-east and to the south-west; the distances between the hive and the food varied from 385 m up to 1250 m. Equipment suitable to heat the observation hive and to determine its internal temperature is described on p. 13. The following results were shown to be statistically significant: 1. The frequency of the waggle-dance is closely connected with the ""weather phase"", a comprehensive estimation of the meteorological conditions. Dances in phase 3 (i.e. exceeded fair weather) are accelerated, whereas in phase 5 and 6 (weather change accomplished and beginning stabilization) they are retarded. 2. The frequency shows an annual rhythm, characterized by high values during hot weather in summer and lower values in the beginning and by the end of the annual foraging period. Deviations in the annual course may be attributed to short-termed fluctuations of the outside temperature. Peculiar weather conditions, such as ""Schafskälte"" or Indian summer, are expressed in the dances of the bees. Equations of the regression of temperature on frequency are given on p. 37. 3. In contrast to the annual rhythm of frequency, the diurnal curve is in many cases characterized by unaccountable oscillations. The latter are unconnected to the changes of weather elements and are variable in the different seasons. However, the rate of waggle-dances is always slowed down in the evening. A remarkable parallelism was also recorded between the internal temperature of the dance floor and the course of frequency of the bees. Attempts to analyse the complex effect of weather conditions in order to single out those factors which may be responsible for the variability of the dances and to eliminate those which are of no importance led to the following results: 4. Neither the absolute intensity of global radiation nor the rate of its attenuation due to haze or cloudiness can be related with the data on the dances. 5. The frequency is clearly correlated with the temperature outside the hive. Waggle-dances are faster (i.e. more wagging lines per unit of time) after a flight in high temperature than in cold weather. The increase of frequency is, however, not linear, but steeper at lower and flatter at higher temperatures. The change of the frequency seems to be independent of the duration of the temperature influence at all flight distances examined. It amounts to an average of 0,3-0,4 turns per 15 seconds as temperature rises by 10° C. Thus, the temperature coefficient (Q10) is surprisingly low, 1,15 being the maximum value. Neither for Q10 nor for μ, i.e. the thermal activation energy could any constancy be observed in the entire range of temperatures. A logarithmic equation of the form f=0,7 log (TA-12)-4,4 log d + 17,2 allows to compute the frequency of waggle-dance f at different external temperatures TA (° C) and distances of the food source d (m). 6. There is also a clear connexion between the temperature inside the hive and the rhythm of dances. The number of turns per unit of time increases, if the temperature on the comb is raised. However, if overheating is continued for a long time, the top frequencies seem to be adaptively lowered. Regarding the entire interval examined, inside and outside temperatures are of about the same effect on the dances. 7. If the temperature of the food is altered independant of radiation and air temperature by offering sugar water warmed from 25 to 35° C, the dances are accelerated by 0,1 turns per 15 seconds. If, on the other hand, a cold solution is fed, the frequency is below normal. 8. Some of the variability of the dances may be ascribed to fluctuations of atmospheric humidity. The information of the bees is influenced by moisture in different ways depending on the external temperature at the same time. There is no traceable effect of humidity on frequency in cool weather. At temperatures above 25° C, the frequency of the dances rises as humidity decreases. (Hence the dances are carried on at a slower pace in sultry weather.) No evidence could be found that rainfall has any influence upon the rhythm of dances, provided that foraging continues. 9. The absolute level of atmospheric pressure is of no influence on the dances. However, increasing air pressure leads to a slight acceleration of dancing, indicating that it is the barometric tendency which is of importance. 10. There is a close relation between the rate of the wagging lines in the dance and the vector of wind velocity in direction to the feeding place. The frequency varies depending on wind direction in the following way: Flight to the food source with tail wind increases, head-wind lowers the frequency. The values for cross-wind stand on medium level, no matter whether the bee is displaced to its left or its right. No special stimulation by ""Föhn"" (this is a characteristic ""fall down"" wind) could be detected. When it is calm, the frequency of dances is higher than after a flight in side-wind; but it is slower than in tail wind. Vigorous air currents intensify these effects: The correlation between wind velocity and dancing rhythm is negative if the bees fly out against the wind, and positive if the blow gets behind the bees on their way to the feeding place. The frequency differs by 0,2 turns per 15 seconds if the bee is hit by an air current of 2 m per second blowing directly from behind or from the front. Judged from the extent of the rate change of dancing, the external temperature was the weightiest of the factors examined, though even here the effects are small. If analysed separately, the information of individual forager bees is in full accordance with the results stated above. As the ""frequency rules"" did not change after disturbing factors had been eliminated, it is assumed, that there is not only a correlation but a true causality. There are individual differences between the bees due to age and temperament. These are always superimposed upon the changes of frequency as a consequence of varying external conditions. It is not necessary to assume further environmental influences to account for the remaining deviations. The differences between the messages of one individual bee, delivered after two successive flights, are of the same extent as the variation between several phases of the same dance. There are without doubt some personal errors in the observation, but those are by no means of great value compared with the real fluctuations of frequency as recorded. © 1964 Springer-Verlag.","über den einfluss meteorologischer faktoren auf die entfernungsweisung im tanz","In the present study the influence of exogenous factors on"

Tests of ODT have however so far mainly been restricted to laboratory settings. By video surveillance, we gathered a large data set of more than 2000 field observations of crab spider (Misumena vatia) encounters with potential prey. We then tested whether the complex ODT or two simpler models (prey identity and prey traits) best explain foraging decisions. Insect prey were killed with an average chance of 3.5% when alighting on an inflorescence harboring a spider. Spiders refused to attack suitable prey in 46-79% of encounters when prey was in attack range, indicating an over-abundance of prey relative to the needs of the spiders. Reduction of opportunities to capture prey along the prey capture sequence differed among pollinator groups, with syrphids and solitary bees showing strong avoidance of spiders early in the sequence and bumblebees resisting the final strike. Simple prey traits explained foraging decisions better than ODT, which was not supported. In the absence of food limitation, optimality decisions may be less stringent. The over-abundance of prey indicates that, in contrast to current theory, prey encounter rates are not the most important factor driving predator foraging decisions. Our results are highly coherent with those obtained in earlier field studies on patch leaving strategies and predator-prey encounters. Prey overabundance and non-optimal predator behavior are apparently not uncommon in nature, and we highlight some of the implications for predator-prey theory.","diet choice of a predator in the wild: overabundance of","Optimal diet theory (ODT) postulates that predators adjust their foraging"

The loss of functionally important species can reduce a variety of ecosystem functions, such as pollination and seed dispersal, but the intricate relationships between land-use intensity, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are still contentious. Along a gradient from forest to intensively used farmland, we quantified bee species richness, visitation rates of bees and pollination success of wild cherry trees (Prunus avium). We analysed the effects of structural habitat diversity at a local scale and of the proportion of suitable habitat around each tree at a landscape scale. We compared these findings with those from previous studies of seed-dispersing birds and mammals in the same model system and along the same land-use gradient. Bee species richness and visitation rates were found to be highest in structurally simple habitats, whereas bird species richness-but not their visitation rates-were highest in structurally complex habitats. Mammal visitation rates were only influenced at the landscape scale. These results show that different functional groups of animals respond idiosyncratically to gradients in habitat and landscape structure. Despite strong effects on bees and birds, pollination success and bird seed removal did not differ along the land-use gradient at both spatial scales. These results suggest that mobile organisms, such as bees and birds, move over long distances in intensively used landscapes and thereby buffer pollination and seed-dispersal interactions. We conclude that measures of species richness and interaction frequencies are not sufficient on their own to understand the ultimate consequences of land-use intensification on ecosystem functioning. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","influence of habitat complexity and landscape configuration on pollination and","Land-use intensification is a major cause for the decline in"

The Sahara is the largest warm desert in the world and together with the arid Sahel displays high topographical and climatic heterogeneity, and has experienced recent and strong climatic oscillations that have greatly shifted biodiversity distribution and community composition. The large size, remoteness and long-term political instability of the Sahara-Sahel, have limited knowledge on its biodiversity. However, over the last decade, there have been an increasing number of published scientific studies based on modern geomatic and molecular tools, and broad sampling of taxa of these regions. This review tracks trends in knowledge about biodiversity patterns, processes and threats across the Sahara-Sahel, and anticipates needs for biodiversity research and conservation. Recent studies are changing completely the perception of regional biodiversity patterns. Instead of relatively low species diversity with distribution covering most of the region, studies now suggest a high rate of endemism and larger number of species, with much narrower and fragmented ranges, frequently limited to micro-hotspots of biodiversity. Molecular-based studies are also unravelling cryptic diversity associated with mountains, which together with recent distribution atlases, allows identifying integrative biogeographic patterns in biodiversity distribution. Mapping of multivariate environmental variation (at 1kmx1km resolution) of the region illustrates main biogeographical features of the Sahara-Sahel and supports recently hypothesised dispersal corridors and refugia. Micro-scale water-features present mostly in mountains have been associated with local biodiversity hotspots. However, the distribution of available data on vertebrates highlights current knowledge gaps that still apply to a large proportion of the Sahara-Sahel. Current research is providing insights into key evolutionary and ecological processes, including causes and timing of radiation and divergence for multiple taxa, and associating the onset of the Sahara with diversification processes for low-mobility vertebrates. Examples of phylogeographic patterns are showing the importance of allopatric speciation in the Sahara-Sahel, and this review presents a synthetic overview of the most commonly hypothesised diversification mechanisms. Studies are also stressing that biodiversity is threatened by increasing human activities in the region, including overhunting and natural resources prospection, and in the future by predicted global warming. A representation of areas of conflict, landmines, and natural resources extraction illustrates how human activities and regional insecurity are hampering biodiversity research and conservation. Although there are still numerous knowledge gaps for the optimised conservation of biodiversity in the region, a set of research priorities is provided to identify the framework data needed to support regional conservation planning.","unravelling biodiversity, evolution and threats to conservation in the sahara-sahel","Deserts and arid regions are generally perceived as bare and"

The diminution of the Alpine Whinchat, once a widespread insectivorous passerine, has been ascribed to nest losses due to earlier and more frequent mowings. However, potential conjugated effects of deteriorated arthropod food availability had yet to be investigated. We compared food supply and nestling diet in intensively vs. traditionally managed grassland. Abundance and diversity of arthropods were much lower in intensive areas, where small-sized invertebrates, which do not enter nestling diet, were also predominant. Parents breeding in intensive habitats fed less biomass to nestlings than adults from traditional habitats. Nestling diet was less diverse and dominated by less profitable prey items in intensive than in traditional habitats. Feeding rate did not differ between the two habitats, but foraging distances from nest tended to be greater in intensive farmland. There were no significant differences in clutch sizes and hatching success with respect to management intensity, but fledging success was higher in traditional habitats. The recent intensification of farming practices has led to a decrease in the availability of grassland invertebrates, and of important Whinchat nestling food in particular, affecting parents' foraging efficiency and reproductive success. Conservation actions must not only reduce nest losses by postponing mowing, but should also promote grassland farming that is less detrimental to invertebrates. Dominant at the study site, organic grassland farming does seemingly not provide sufficient conditions for Alpine Whinchats. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Five different sensory systems have been implicated in acquiring and communicating the information necessary for dance language communication. We present results from neuronal tracer studies identifying the central projections from four of the five. Sensory neurons of the dorsal rim area of the compound eyes, involved in acquiring sun-compass based information, project to the dorsal-most part of the medulla. Sensory neurons of the neck hair plates, required to transpose sun-compass based information to gravity-based information in the dark hive, project to the dorsal labial neuromere of the subesophageal ganglion. Sensory neurons from the antennal joint hair sensilla and the Johnston's organ, which perceive information on dance direction and distance from mechanostimuli generated by abdomen waggling and wing vibration, project to the deutocerebral dorsal lobe and the subesophageal ganglion, and the posterior protocerebrum, respectively. We found no 'dance-specific' projections relative to those previously described for drone and queen honey bees and other insect species that do not exhibit dance communication. We suggest that the evolution of dance language communication was likely based on the modification of central neural pathways associated with path integration, the capability to calculate distance, and directional information during flight.

Analysis indicated that increased visitation to alfalfa was significantly related to distance of the alfalfa from wildflowers, but not to the size of the alfalfa plantation. Alfalfa growing less than 10 m from wildflowers seemed to benefit by spill-over (''facilitation'') of pollinators from the wildflowers. Alfalfa isolated from wildflowers by other alfalfa plants for a distance of at least 200 m attracted very few pollinators, the wildflowers apparently providing more attractive sources of pollen and nectar. A single plantation highly isolated (by about 600 m) from wildflowers proved to be very attractive to pollinators, apparently because wild nesting bees in the vicinity had little alternative but the alfalfa.

Simulation models of pollination networks suggest that plant communities will be resilient to losing many or even most of the pollinator species in an ecosystem. These predictions, however, have not been tested empirically and implicitly assume that pollination efficacy is unaffected by interactions with interspecific competitors. By contrast, ecological theory and data from a wide range of ecosystems show that interspecific competition can drive variation in ecological specialization over short timescales via behavioral or morphological plasticity, although the potential implications of such changes in specialization for ecosystem functioning remain unexplored. We conducted manipulative field experiments in which we temporarily removed single pollinator species from study plots in subalpine meadows, to test the hypothesis that interactions between pollinator species can shape individual species' functional roles via changes in foraging specialization. We show that loss of a single pollinator species reduces floral fidelity (shortterm specialization) in the remaining pollinators, with significant implications for ecosystem functioning in terms of reduced plant reproduction, even when potentially effective pollinators remained in the system. Our results suggest that ongoing pollinator declines may have more serious negative implications for plant communities than is currently assumed. More broadly, we show that the individual functional contributions of species can be dynamic and shaped by the community of interspecific competitors, thereby documenting a distinct mechanism for how biodiversity can drive ecosystem functioning, with potential relevance to a wide range of taxa and systems.","single pollinator species losses reduce floral fidelity and plant reproductive","Understanding the functional impacts of pollinator species losses on plant"

In particular, better knowledge of which habitats bees utilize for foraging over their lifetime would inform a range of applied and theoretical questions. Traditional methods of studying foraging are either impractical for insects (e.g. radio tracking) or else are limited spatially or temporally (e.g. observations by researchers). Here we describe a method for using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen from bee tissues to gain an integrated signal of which habitats a bee has foraged in over its lifetime, using three species of social stingless bee (Apidae: Meliponini) in a fragmented tropical forest landscape in southern Costa Rica as a test case. There were strongly significant differences in the carbon and nitrogen isotope signals of bees collected in the landscape extremes: the largest forests and largest open pastures in the region. We could not estimate proportions of dietary carbon and nitrogen derived from different habitats, however, due to the high sample variance. Still, isotope ratios reflect a signature of the habitat that a bee has foraged in, and we found significant relationships between foraging patterns and season, landscape context (proportion of forest surrounding sample sites) and local biotic context (bee and plant diversity and abundance). Landscape context was the most consistent factor among the analyses, in line with the idea that meliponines do not preferentially forage in deforested habitats. Bee and plant diversity and abundance showed various significant relationships with the isotopic values of the different species, but the patterns were inconsistent. These results are potentially consistent with habitat switching from pasture to forest in areas of greater competition, but the extreme spatiotemporal variability in resource density likely blurs these patterns. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We studied the effects of distance to forest, tree management, and floral resources on bee communities in pastures (the dominant land-use type) in southern Costa Rica. Over two years, we sampled bees and floral resources in 21 pastures at three distance classes from a large (∼230-ha) forest patch and of three common types: open pasture; pasture with remnant trees; and pasture with live fences. We found no consistent differences in bee diversity or abundance with respect to pasture management or floral resources. Bee community composition, however, was strikingly different at forest edges as compared to deforested countryside only a few hundred meters from forest. At forest edges, native social stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) comprised ∼50% of the individuals sampled, while the alien honeybee Apis mellifera made up only ∼5%. Away from forests, meliponines dropped to ∼20% of sampled bees, whereas Apis increased to ∼45%. Meliponine bees were also more speciose at forest edge sites than at a distance from forest, their abundance decreased with continuous distance to the nearest forest patch, and their species richness was correlated with the proportion of forest cover surrounding sample sites at scales from 200 to 1200 m. Meliponines and Apis together comprise the eusocial bee fauna of the study area and are unique in quickly recruiting foragers to high-quality resources. The diverse assemblage of native meliponine bees covers a wide range of body sizes and flower foraging behavior not found in Apis, and populations of many bee species (including Apis), are known to fluctuate considerably from year to year. Thus, the forest-related changes in eusocial bee communities we found may have important implications for: (1) sustaining a diverse bee fauna in tropical countryside; (2) ensuring the effective pollination of a diverse native plant community; and (3) the efficiency and stability of agricultural pollination, particularly for short-time-scale, mass-flowering crops such as coffee. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","bee community shifts with landscape context in a tropical countryside","The ongoing scientific controversy over a putative ""global pollination crisis"""

Despite ongoing concerns and controversy over a putative 'global pollination crisis' there is little information on the response of bees, the most important group of pollinators, to land-use change. In particular, there are no published studies of the effects of tropical forest fragmentation on entire bee communities. 2. We examined bee community responses to forest fragment size, shape, isolation and landscape context (forest variables) by sampling foraging bees at ground level using aerial netting within, and in pastures adjacent to, 22 forest fragments ranging in area from c. 0.25 ha to 230 ha, in southern Costa Rica. We sampled each site 13 times in total, in both wet and dry seasons. 3. Although there were no effects of forest variables on bee diversity and abundance, we did find strong changes in bee community composition. In particular, tree-nesting meliponines (social stingless bees) were associated with larger fragments, smaller edge:area ratios and greater proportions of forest surrounding sample points, while introduced Apis showed opposite patterns. 4. Community composition was also strikingly different between forests and pastures, despite their spatial proximity. In forests, even in the smallest patches, meliponines comprised a much larger proportion of the apifauna, and orchid bees (euglossines) were common. In pastures, Apis was much more abundant and no euglossine bees were found. 5. These results agree broadly with other studies that have found contrasting responses to habitat fragmentation from different bee groups. Conserving meliponine bees, important for pollination of coffee and other crops, and euglossine bees, critical in long-distance pollen transport, will require forest. 6. Synthesis and applications. In the first study of the effects of tropical forest fragmentation on entire understorey bee assemblages, we found bee community resilience to land-use change, as deforested sites and small forest fragments can have a diverse component of bees. While bees as a whole show some degree of resilience to land-use change, there are taxon-specific responses and, in our study area, there is clear value to conserving native forest, particularly for the ecologically and economically important meliponine and euglossine bees. © 2007 The Authors.","the effects of forest fragmentation on bee communities in tropical","1.

Quantity of pollinator visits to a native may increase, decrease, or change nonlinearly, while visit quality is likely to decrease with greater interspecific pollen movement. How visit quantity and quality contribute to the effect on reproductive success at each invasion stage has not been measured. METHODS: We simulated four stages of invasion by Brassica nigra by manipulating the neighborhood of potted plants of the native Phacelia parryi in a field experiment. Stages were far from the invasion, near the invasion, intermixed with the invasive at low density, and intermixed at high density. We measured pollinator visitation, conspecific and invasive pollen deposition, and seed set for P. parryi at each stage. KEY RESULTS: Native individuals near invasive plants and within areas of low invasive density showed greatest seed production, as expected from concurrent changes in conspecific and invasive pollen deposition. Those plants experienced facilitation of visits and received more conspecific pollen relative to plants farther from invasives. Native individuals within high invasive density also received frequent visits by many pollinators (although not honeybees), but the larger receipt of invasive pollen predicted interference with pollen tubes that matched patterns in seed set. CONCLUSIONS: Pollinator visitation was highest when exotic plants were nearby. Detrimental effects of heterospecific pollen deposition were highest at high exotic density.

We explored how the heterospecific floral neighborhood (abundance of native and non-native heterospecific plants within 2 m x 2 m) affects pollinator visitation and composition of pollinator assemblages for a native plant, Phacelia parryi. The relative effectiveness of different insect visitors was also assessed to interpret the potential effects on plant fitness of shifts in pollinator assemblage composition. Although the common non-native Brassica nigra did not have a significant effect on overall pollinator visitation rate to P. parryi, the proportion of flower visits that were made by native pollinators increased with increasing abundance of heterospecific plant species in the floral neighborhood other than B. nigra. Furthermore, native pollinators deposited twice as many P. parryi pollen grains per visit as did the nonnative Apis mellifera, and visits by native bees also resulted in more seeds than visits by A. mellifera. These results indicate that the floral neighborhood can influence the composition of pollinator assemblages that visit a native plant and that changes in local flower communities have the potential to affect plant reproductive success through shifts in these assemblages towards less effective pollinators.","floral neighborhood influences pollinator assemblages and effective pollination in a","Pollinators represent an important intermediary by which different plant species"

The goal of this study is to link foraging behavior to gene flow and identify behaviors that can help predict gene flow for different bee species. To reach this goal, we first examined and compared the foraging behaviors of three distinct bee species, the European honey bee, Apis mellifera L., the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens Cr., and the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata F., foraging on Medicago sativa flowers. Each foraging behavior investigated differed among bee species. Both social bees exhibited directionality of movement and had similar residence, in contrast to the random movement and shorter residence of the solitary bee. Tripping rate and net distance traveled differed among the three bee species. We ranked each behavior among bee species and used the relative ranking as gene flow predictor before testing the predictions against empirical gene flow data. Tripping rate and net distance traveled, but not residence, predicted relative gene dispersal among bee species. Linking specific behaviors to gene flow provides mechanisms to explain differences in gene flow among bee species and guides the development of management practices to reduce gene flow. Although developed in one system, the approach developed here can be generalized to different plant/pollinator systems. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Because a mature seed is needed before a gene flow event can occur, pollen viability will influence the risk of escape for genetically engineered (GE) crops. Pollen viability was measured at intervals for up to 2 h following removal of the pollen from the anthers. It was quantified at three temperatures and for different alfalfa varieties, including both conventional and Roundup Ready (RR) varieties. Pollen viability was assessed using in vitro germination. Time since removal from the anthers was the most prevalent factor affecting pollen viability in alfalfa. Pollen viability declined with increasing time at all three temperatures and for all varieties tested. Pollen viability was not affected by temperatures ranging between 25 and 37 degrees C and did not vary among plant varieties, including conventional and RR varieties. Bee foraging behaviour suggested pollen viability within the first 10 min following pollen removal from a flower to most affect seed production. Pollen longevity was predicted to have little impact on seed set and gene flow. Linking pollinator behaviour to pollen viability improved our understanding of its impact on gene flow risk.","the effects of time, temperature and plant variety on pollen","Pollen viability affects the probability that a pollen grain deposited"

The Australian allodapine bee Exoneura bicolor exhibits a number of traits that occur in cooperatively breeding bird species, including long life-span, repeated opportunities for reproduction, and vulnerability to brood predation and parasitism. We experimentally examined the effect of a potentially limiting environmental factor, nesting substrate availability, as an agent influencing sociality in E. bicolor. We manipulated nesting substrate availability in two separate locations during a time when foundress dispersal is common. No significant difference was found between colony sizes in cases where dispersal options were abundant and cases where dispersal options were limited. An increase in opportunities for dispersal did not lead to higher rates of independent nesting, suggesting that cooperative nesting is a preferred strategy regardless of distance-related costs of dispersal. Reproductivity per female and brood survival were examined as factors selecting for group living. Low survival of brood in single-female nests has the potential to select for cooperative nesting in this bee.","the habitat saturation hypothesis and sociality in an allodapine bee:","Several factors thought to be important for the evolution of"

In burned and unburned areas in Montana, USA, we investigated the abundance and diversity of native bees, floral and nesting resources, nesting success, and traits of flowers and bees. In two of the three localities studied, burned areas, including areas that burned with high-severity wildfires, supported higher density and diversity of native bees and the flowers they depend on for food and larval provisioning. Burned areas also had more bare ground for ground-nesting bees and more available coarse woody debris for cavity-nesting bees than unburned areas. Moreover, cavity-nesting bees were completely unsuccessful at nesting in artificial nesting boxes in unburned areas, while nesting success was 40% in burned areas. Mean bee intertegular distance (a trait strongly correlated with tongue length, foraging distance, and body size) was similar between burned and unburned areas. However, wildfires influenced both interspecific and intraspecific trait variation of bees and plants. Intraspecific variation in bee intertegular distance was higher in unburned than burned areas. Both interspecific and intraspecific variation in floral traits important for interactions with pollinators were generally higher in burned than unburned areas. Thus, wildfires generally increased the density and species diversity of bees and flowers as well as trait variation at both trophic levels. We conclude that wildfires-even large, high-severity wildfires-create conditions that support native bees and the resources they need to flourish, but that unburned areas maintain trait variation in landscape mosaics with heterogeneous fire conditions. © 2019 Burkle, Simanonok, Durney, Myers and Belote.","wildfires influence abundance, diversity, and intraspecific and interspecific trait variation","Wildfire regimes are changing in the western United States, yet"

One strategy for efficient foraging used by bumblebees is near-far search, involving short flights when in good patches of flowers and longer flights when in poor patches. Bumblebees also demonstrate the use of a spatial memory strategy by returning repeatedly to patches of flowers, and even following the same route between flowers, over periods of days. We attempted to determine at what spatial scales bumblebees use spatial memory while foraging within a patch and after how many flower visits spatial memory outweighs near-far search. Bumblebees in the laboratory foraged on a 4 X 4 array of artificial flowers with distances ranging from 10 to 80 cm between flowers in two simple spatial patterns. The proportion of visits to flowers containing a sucrose reward was monitored for either 100 or 400 flower visits in two separate experiments, after which the locations of the rewarding and nonrewarding flowers were interchanged, producing a mirror image. A drop in accuracy after the mirror image switch would indicate that the bees had memorized the location of rewarding flowers. Mirror image tests, and comparisons to a simulation model of near-far search based on actual flight distances, indicate that naive bumblebees used near-far search on flowers 10 cm apart but increasingly used spatial memory as experience and spatial separation increased. Bumblebees thus have multiple tactics available to forage efficiently in different environments. © The Author 2005.

One of the most widely used group of pesticides are neonicotinoids, used in treatments of various plants, e.g. oilseed crops, corn and apples, to prevent crop damage by agricultural insect pests. Treatment effects have been found to spill over to non-target insects, such as bees, and more recently also to other animal groups, among them passerine birds. Very little is known, however, on the presence of neonicotinoids in other wild species at higher trophic levels. We present results on the presence of neonicotinoid residues in blood samples of a long-distant migratory food-specialist raptor, the European honey buzzard. Further, we investigate the spatial relationship between neonicotinoid residue prevalence in honey buzzards with that of crop fields where neonicotinoids are typically used. A majority of all blood samples contained neonicotinoids, thiacloprid accounting for most of the prevalence. While neonicotinoid residues were detected in both adults and nestlings, the methodological limit of quantification was exceeded only in nestlings. Neonicotinoids were present in all sampled nests. Neonicotinoid presence in honey buzzard nestlings’ blood matched spatially with the presence of oilseed plant fields. These are the first observations of neonicotinoids in a diurnal raptor.

Outcrossing was variable, ranging from 52 to 89%, and long distance pollen dispersal was observed in all populations with up to 65% of pollen sourced from outside the populations over distances of at least 1 km. Modelling dispersal functions for pollination events within the two larger populations showed little difference between the four two-parameter models tested and indicated a fat-tailed dispersal curve.

Following the principle of a case-by-case for transgenic crop safety assessment, we designed experiments to study pollen-mediated gene flow from herbicide-resistant transgenic oilseed rape to Chinese commercial varieties. The pollen dispersal was detected as the progeny of recipient plants that were identified as glufosinate resistant. The results indicated that pollen dispersal occurred up to 2000 m and its rate sharply decreased as the distance from the pollen source increased. However, the rate of long-distance pollen dispersal from 33 to 2000 m was less than 0.015% and did not present a gradual decrease, indicating the randomization of dispersal and pollination. Most pollen dispersed within a 4.5 m area around the transgenic pollen source plot, with a maximum of 1.19% at the sampling site of 1.4 m. Wind direction significantly affected the direction and the distance of pollen dispersal, resulting in the more and farther dispersal in southwest direction. However, the number of potentially pollinating bees was not correlated with direction and distance from the pollen source plot, suggesting that bee density and distribution would not contribute to the differences in pollen dispersal among different directions.

A.m. caucasica exists where honeybee predators typically are rare, while the remaining subspecies have ranges that coincide with areas where honeybee predators are abundant. Foraging decisions of workers visiting artificial flower patches containing blue, white, and yellow flowers were recorded. We tested whether foragers responded to differences in rewarding flower frequency among flower color morphs. Division of labor occurred among foragers of each race; some bees frequented yellow flowers while other bees from the same hive visited blue and white flowers. A.m. caucasica foragers ignored differences in reward frequency among flower colors. Even bees that frequented blue and white flowers did not base flower choice on reward frequency differences between just these two color morphs. In contrast, A.m. armeniaca, A.m. cypria, and A.m. syriaca, however, did respond to differences in reward frequencies, tending to avoid the less frequently rewarding flower color morph.

Two stimuli, with a mean wavelength of 40 nm perceptual distance, were chosen from the UV (340 nm vs 380 nm) and the green (510 nm vs 550 nm) range because these species are UV-green dichromats.

We also determined nectar sugar concentrations of unmanipulated returning foragers to assess temporal changes in collected resource quality. Maximum and typical homing distances (i.e. distances where 90% and 50% of released bees are lost) were estimated to be 860 and 392 m, respectively, confirming that while some individuals travel long distances, most workers must remain close to nests during foraging trips. Homing distances and collected nectar sugar concentrations showed inverse temporal patterns, as homing range declined in later months (May to August), whereas nectar sugar concentrations increased over the same period. Thus, shorter homing distances in later ‘dry season’ months probably reflected an increased availability of floral resources compared with earlier months.

The algorithm has been tested in a number of situations and, within the bounds of the study, works to a better than 90% classification accuracy for Digital Single Lens Reflex camera images of trees within 15 m distance, and often better than 95%. To determine how this approach could be used by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle platforms to detect flowering Corymbia calophylla flowering, image resolution was progressively degraded until flowers could not be detected. It was found that the cluster size of flowers (i.e. whether flowers occur individually or in groups) played an important role in determining the accuracy of flower detection, but overall a minimum resolution of 10 pixels per flower is required for reliable detection of flower pixels. While there is some improvement above this resolution, the effect is minimal. The key to accurate measurement of percentage flower cover is the accuracy of the classification of the background. If the background classification error is known for an image or scene, the percentage flower cover can be calculated with as little as 2% flower cover. Based on this study, UAV platforms with standard RGB cameras appear to be suitable for detection of Corymbia calophylla flowers if surveys are designed within the bounds described.

To evaluate the response of this bee fauna to fragmentation, we compared species incidence and abundance patterns for the bee guild visiting L. tridentata at 59 habitat fragments of known size (0.002-5 ha) and age (up to 70 years), and in adjacent desert. The 62 bee species caught during this study responded to fragmentation heterogeneously and not in direct relation to their abundance or incidence in undisturbed desert. Few species found outside the city were entirely absent from urban fragments. Species of ground-nesting L. tridentata specialists were underrepresented in smaller fragments and less abundant in the smaller and older fragments. In contrast, cavity-nesting bees (including one L. tridentata specialist) were overrepresented in the habitat fragments, probably due to enhanced nesting opportunities available in the urban matrix. Small-bodied bee species were no more likely than larger bodied species to be absent from the smaller fragments. The introduced European honey bee, Apis mellifera, was a minor faunal element at >90% of the fragments and exerted little if any influence on the response of native bee species to fragmentation. Overall, bee response to urban habitat fragmentation was best predicted by ecological traits associated with nesting and dietary breadth. Had species been treated as individual units in the analyses, or pooled together into one analysis, these response patterns may not have been apparent. Pollination interactions with this floral host are probably not adversely affected in this system because of its longevity and ability to attract diverse pollinators but will demand careful further study to understand. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","complex responses within a desert bee guild (hymenoptera: apiformes) to","Urbanization within the Tucson Basin of Arizona during the past"

A range of discrete pollen doses applied to cranberry stigmas resulted in decelerating curvilinear responses for fruiting, berry size, and seed set. Minimum thresholds and maximum asymptotes bounded reproductive responses to incremental stigmatic pollen loads. Four bee species were compared for their pollination efficacies on commercial cranberries, using counts of pollen received by stigmas during single bee visits to previously virgin flowers. Differences between these bee species were found to be exaggerated when raw pollen counts were used for comparison because foragers of some species often delivered pollen in excess of that needed to maximize fruit and seed production. Sixfold differences between species in mean pollen deposition translated into 1.5-2-fold differences in predicted cranberry fruit set and size.

Pollen-foraging honey bees yielded a calculated 63% more berries than equal numbers of non-thieving nectar-foragers, even though both classes of forager made stigmatic contact. 3. Colonies headed by queens of a pollen-hoarding genotype fielded significantly more pollen-foraging trips than standard commercial genotypes, as did hives fitted with permanently engaged pollen traps or colonies containing more larvae. Pollen-hoarding colonies together brought back twice as many cranberry pollen loads as control colonies, which was marginally significant despite marked daily variation in the proportion of collected pollen that was cranberry. 4. Caloric supplementation of matched, paired colonies failed to enhance pollen foraging despite the meagre nectar yields of individual cranberry flowers. 5. Heritable behavioural polymorphisms of the honey bee, such as pollen-hoarding, can enhance fruit and seed set by a floral host (e.g. cranberry), but only if more preferred pollen hosts are absent or rare.

Using harmonic radar, we show for the first time a striking ontogeny to honeybee orientation flights. With increased experience, bees hold trip duration constant but fly faster, so later trips cover a larger area than earlier trips. In addition, each flight is typically restricted to a narrow sector around the hive. Orientation flights provide honeybees with repeated opportunities to view the hive and landscape features from different viewpoints, suggesting that bees learn the local landscape in a progressive fashion. We also show that these changes in orientation flight are related to the number of previous flights taken instead of chronological age, suggesting a learning process adapted to changes in weather conditions, flower availability and the needs of bee colonies.","ontogeny of orientation flight in the honeybee revealed by harmonic","Cognitive ethology focuses on the study of animals under natural"

However, few studies have examined how much of the variance in tropical tree fecundity is explained by individual attributes of trees (e.g. number of flowers), and how much is due to contextual variables such as distances to nearest flowering neighbours. Using multiple regressions we examined the relative contributions of these factors to the pollination and fecundity of Goetzea elegans, a mainly self-incompatible tree endemic to Puerto Rico. We studied the largest wild population of the species during the peak flowering and collected data on the frequency of pollinator visits (N = 25 trees), and the fecundity of the whole population (N = 105), including the visitation rate of two pollinators (the honey bee Apis mellifera and the bananaquit Coereba flaveola), the total number of flowers produced by each tree, and the total fruit set and seed viability per tree. We also recorded the distance to flowering conspecifics and heterospecifics, and the height for each tree. Flower number had a strong positive effect on pollinator visitation, but distance to nearest neighbours was equally or more important than flower number in influencing fecundity. Also, competition for limited pollinators between G. elegans and other species has a stronger effect than the facilitation that conspecifics may provide. Our results suggest that pollinator visits and aspects of fecundity of G. elegans depend both on the attributes of individual plants, and on those of the community of other nearby plants.","flower number and distance to neighbours affect the fecundity of","Pollinator visits to flowers of self-incompatible tropical trees are critical"

These relationships are often phylogenetically shared; thus quantifying allometric relationships may allow for estimating difficult-to-measure traits across species. One such trait, proboscis length in bees, is assumed to be important in structuring bee communities and plantpollinator networks. However, it is difficult to measure and thus rarely included in ecological analyses. We measured intertegular distance (as a measure of body size) and proboscis length (glossa and prementum, both individually and combined) of 786 individual bees of 100 species across 5 of the 7 extant bee families (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila). Using linear models and model selection, we determined which parameters provided the best estimate of proboscis length. We then used coefficients to estimate the relationship between intertegular distance and proboscis length, while also considering family. Using allometric equations with an estimation for a scaling coefficient between intertegular distance and proboscis length and coefficients for each family, we explain 91% of the variance in species-level means for bee proboscis length among bee species. However, within species, individual-level intertegular distance was a poor predictor of individual proboscis length. To make our findings easy to use, we created an R package that allows estimation of proboscis length for individual bee species by inputting only family and intertegular distance. The R package also calculates foraging distance and body mass based on previously published equations. Thus by considering both taxonomy and intertegular distance we enable accurate estimation of an ecologically and evolutionarily important trait. © 2016 Cariveau et al.

In this study, we aimed to explore whether changes in the distribution of bee ecological traits along gradients of habitat amount and fragmentation were due to a direct effect of landscape context on multiple traits ('response traits') or to a correlation of response traits with other ecological traits not involved in the response of bee species to landscape context. In two study regions in southwest France and southeast Australia, we used a RLQ analysis (three-table ordination method) to link bee traits with habitat amount and fragment isolation measured at the landscape scale. We found that bee ecological traits shifted at the community-level in association with landscape gradients, whereas species-level associations among bee traits and phylogenetic clustering in bee communities were of only minor importance in determining such shifts. We found that traits such as body size and nest location were closely linked to habitat amount and fragmentation. We also observed regionally-specific relationships among ecological traits, suggesting that the regional species pool can play an important role in determining the response of bee communities to habitat amount and fragmentation.

Wild bees were sampled in 43 cereal fields in south-western France differing in the surrounding proportion of permanent grasslands. Using remote sensing tools, we measured two parameters of grassland structure known to locally influence bee nest density (slope and proportion of sparse vegetation). We found that mean slope of surrounding grasslands was the factor that most positively influenced bee richness, abundance and trait distribution in bee communities. We also found that mean slope of surrounding grasslands had a better predictive power of bee community structure than the proportion of permanent grasslands. Ground-nesting species, species with high dispersal capacities and species with a generalist diet were positively affected by the availability of sloped ground in the surrounding permanent grasslands. Only bee species with specialized flower requirements responded positively to the proportion of sparse vegetation in grasslands. Our results suggest that landscape-scale availability of nesting resources provided by grasslands affects bee communities in agricultural landscapes and can help sustain functionally diverse bee assemblages.

These differences in habitat structure may significantly influence the fitness of both plant and pollinator. To examine the effect of habitat structure on pollinator movement and fitness, we observed captive worker bumble bees collecting nectar from artificial flowers containing equal volumes of reward and arranged in two spatial configurations: a hexagonal array with constant distances between flowers ('constant'), and an 'exploded hexagonal' array, with variable distances between flowers ('variable'). The mean nearest-neighbour distance was the same in both arrays, as was the general hexagonal appearance. The experiment therefore compares how resource dispersion, independent of nearest-neighbour distance, influences bee behaviour. Bees in the variable array showed decreased directionality, higher revisitation frequencies, and greater inter-flower flight distances than shown in the constant array. As a consequence, bees in the variable array had a 19% lower gross rate of nectar collection. Our results suggest that wild-foraging bees should prefer regularly spaced flowers (when all else, including mean nearest-neighbour distance, is equal), and that plants can decrease self-pollination by regular spacing between flowers, inflorescences, or individuals.","habitat structure and animal movement: the behaviour of bumble bees","Foraging organisms (like bumble bees) move between resource points (like"

The floral visitors were accompanied in 2005 and 2006, during the flowering period, from October to December, in three areas of the cerrado with different sizes and with lower or higher natural vegetation covering. Bees were collected fortnightly, with entomological net, by two collectors. Six samples were carried out in 2005 during 8 hours a day, and five samples were carried out in 2006 during 4 hours a day. In the first stage 1,516 bees from 80 species were sampled, with the dominance of 24 species (30%). In the second stage 562 individuals from 66 species were sampled, with the dominance of 10 species (15%). Bees were from five Apoidea families, in a total of 105 species and 2078 individuals. Apidae was the most common family both in number of species and number of individuals. The predominance of Apidae in relation to the number of individuals occurred mainly due to two eusocial species, Apis mellifera and Scaptotrigona depilis.

We conducted a large-scale study across landscapes exhibiting a gradient of agricultural intensity to investigate the effects of a targeted flower mixture, sown in patches of three different sizes, on an index of the total biomass of bumblebee sexuals (males and queens) on replicated transects within each landscape. We used this index (MQ) as a measure of bumblebee reproduction. After controlling for floral density on transects, we found that MQ was significantly higher on sown flower patches than on conventionally managed control patches at local scales throughout the three-year study. While sown flower patches did not significantly increase MQ in surrounding landscapes, MQ was higher in landscapes surrounding larger (1. ha) than smaller (0.25. ha) sown patches. Our results suggest that, while responses of different bee species may vary depending on the plant species sown, targeted flower mixtures can enhance bumblebee reproduction by providing locally attractive forage resources to bumblebees of all castes and sexes from nests within foraging distance. If established at large enough scales, sown flower patches may lead to a detectable spill-over of reproductives into surrounding landscapes. Furthermore, effects of sown patches on MQ were moderated by landscape context, the strongest positive responses being detected at sites with high proportions of arable land.

Scientific evaluation of the options prescribed within the scheme is essential to ensure that their objectives are met and that the benefits can be realized by the full bumble bee species assemblage. 2. We compared the efficacy of different ES options for field margins on arable land in enhancing the abundance and diversity of flowering resources and foraging bumble bees. Our study was conducted over 3 years using a multisite experiment. 3. Overall, uncropped margins sown with mixtures containing nectar and pollen-producing plants were more effective in providing bumble bee forage than margins sown with a grass mix, allowed to regenerate naturally or managed as conservation headlands. 4. A mixture of agricultural legumes established quickly and attracted on average the highest total abundance and diversity of bumble bees, including the rare long-tongued species Bombus ruderatus and Bombus muscorum. However, marked differences were observed between species and sexes in their responses to field margin management over time. 5.

We present the results of a large-scale study that investigated the effects of a targeted agri-environment scheme (AES) on bumble bees (Bombus spp.) over three years in the United Kingdom. Forage patches of different sizes were sown with a conservation flower mixture across eight sites covering a broad range of agricultural land use types. Species richness and worker densities (especially of the longer-tongued Bombus species for which the mixture was targeted) were significantly higher on sown forage patches than on existing non-crop control habitats throughout the three-year study, but the strength of this response depended on both the proportions of arable land and abundance of herbaceous forb species in the surrounding landscape. The size of sown patches also affected worker density, with smaller patches (0.25 ha) attracting higher densities of some species than larger patches (1.0 ha). Our models show that a targeted AES can deliver greater net benefits in more intensively farmed areas, in terms of the number and species richness of bumble bees supported, than in heterogeneous landscapes where other foraging habitats exist.

We analysed the temporal, spatial and ecological patterns of the diversification of Cucurbita, an American genus of worldwide economic importance. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on six chloroplast regions (5907 bp) to estimate diversification rates and dates of divergence between taxa. This is the first phylogenetic study to include C. radicans, a wild species that is endemic to the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt. We performed analysis of ancestral area reconstruction and paleoreconstructions of species distribution models to understand shifts in wild species ranges. We used principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to evaluate the environmental differentiation among taxa within each Glade. The phylogenetic analyses showed good support for at least six independent domestication events in Cucurbita. The genus Cucurbita showed a time of divergence of 11.24 Ma (6.88-17 Ma 95% HDP), and the dates of divergence between taxa within each group ranged from 0.35 to 6.58 Ma, being the divergence between C. lundelhana and C. okeechobeensis subsp. martinezii the most recent. The diversification rate of the genus was constant through time. The diversification of most wild taxa occurred during the Pleistocene, and its date of divergence is concordant with the dates of divergence reported for specialized bees of the genera Xenoglossa and Peponapis, suggesting a process of coevolution between Cucurbita and their main pollinators that should be further investigated. Tests of environmental differentiation together with ancestral area reconstruction and species distribution models past projections suggest that divergence was promoted by the onset of geographic barriers and secondary range contraction and by expansion related to glacial-interglacial cycles.","historical biogeography and phylogeny of cucurbita: insights from ancestral area","Knowledge of the role of geographical and ecological events associated"

However, past functional studies have focused largely on seed production; although useful, this focus on seed set does not provide information regarding species-specific contributions to pollen-mediated gene flow. Here we quantify pollen dispersal for individual pollinator species across more than 690 ha of tropical forest. Specifically, we examine visitation, seed production, and pollen-dispersal ability for the entire pollinator community of a common tropical tree using a series of individual-based pollinator-exclusion experiments followed by molecular-based fractional paternity analyses. We investigate the effects of pollinator body size, plant size (as a proxy of floral display), local plant density, and local plant kinship on seed production and pollen-dispersal distance. Our results show that while large-bodied pollinators set more seeds per visit, small-bodied bees visited flowers more frequently and were responsible for more than 49% of all long-distance (beyond 1 km) pollen-dispersal events. Thus, despite their size, small-bodied bees play a critical role in facilitating long-distance pollen-mediated gene flow. We also found that both plant size and local plant kinship negatively impact pollen dispersal and seed production. By incorporating genetic and trait-based data into the quantification of pollination services, we highlight the diversity in ecological function mediated by pollinators, the influential role that plant and population attributes play in driving service provision, and the unexpected importance of small-bodied pollinators in the recruitment of plant genetic diversity. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

Here we measured the effects of the nectar-robbing bumblebees on male (measured as pollen analogue flow distance) and female (measured as seed production) reproductive success in the insect-dependent Polygala vayredae, a narrow endemic species from the pre-Pyrenees (Spain). Intense nectar robbing by bumblebees significantly reduced the nectar available to legitimate pollinators in the studied population, and this reduction affected both male and female fitness. Significant differences were observed in fluorescent dye dispersion between robbed and non-robbed flowers within the population. Fluorescent dyes from non-robbed flowers were dispersed to larger distances and over a larger number of flowers when compared with robbed ones. Moreover, significant differences were observed in both fruit set and seed ovule ratios between the two groups, with non-robbed flowers presenting higher reproductive outcomes. However, no effect on seed weight was detected among treatments.

The Main Agroecological Structure (MAS) is a new concept to identify and characterize the agroecosystems. The method uses local variables related with agricultural management, landscape and cultural variables. As a first approach to study the relationship between MAS and pollination, we characterized nine systems (five coffee farms, four forests) located in Cundinamarca, using ten local variables, the distance to the forest as a landscape variable and bees (visitors of coffee flowers). The field work was done during the flowerings of 2011 y 2012. After the capture, bees were identified and the pollen loads were analyzed. We found 130 bees of the subfamilies: Halictinae (three species), Megachilidae (one species) and Apinae (nine species). Trigona was the richest genera. The most common visitors of coffee flowers were Apis mellifera and Paratrigona eutaeniata. The bees richness was positive related with plants richness (P = 0.031, R2 = 0.96) and the forest proximity (P = 0.0075, R2 = 0.52), Also, we found a negatively trend with the increase in coffee density (P = 0.045, R2 = 0.67). In the analysis of the pollen loads we identified trees, herbs and epiphytes species, this suggested that bees foraging in all vegetation strata. In this analysis we also found species related with the coffee system and others more related with forest and hedges.

Colonies with typical honey bee depopulation symptoms were selected for multiple possible factors to reveal the causes of collapse. Results: Omnipresent were Nosema ceranae and Lake Sinai Virus. Moderate prevalences were found for Black Queen Cell Virus and trypanosomatids, whereas Deformed Wing Virus, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus strain Brookings and neogregarines were rarely detected. Other viruses, Nosema apis, Acarapis woodi and Varroa destructor were not detected. Palinologic study of pollen demonstrated that all colonies were foraging on wild vegetation. Consequently, the pesticide residue analysis was negative for neonicotinoids. The genetic analysis of trypanosomatids GAPDH gene, showed that there is a large genetic distance between Crithidia mellificae ATCC30254, an authenticated cell strain since 1974, and the rest of the presumed C. mellificae sequences obtained in our study or published.

Unfortunately, bumblebees are challenged by various stress factors including insecticide applications. Today sublethal effects of various insecticides need to be thoroughly investigated to allow their combined use with pollinators and other beneficial organisms. In this study, we used lambda-cyhalothrin as a model pyrethroid insecticide and investigated lethal and sublethal effects by different dilutions, ranging from 1/10 to 1/100 of its maximum field recommended dosage (MFRC, 37.5 ppm), with the use of a chronic toxicity tests in the laboratory and in flight cages in the greenhouse. In the laboratory, small microcolonies with five bumblebee workers with one being pseudo-queen were used, while in the greenhouse we used queen-right mini-hives where the bumblebees need to fly for pyrethroid-contaminated food. We observed strong sublethal effects in the laboratory with treatments of 1/10 and 1/20 of the MFRC: the nest reproduction was reduced by 49 and 32 %, respectively, and the sugar water consumption by 36 %. With free-flying bumblebees, the toxic effects at 1/10 of the MFRC were more pronounced. A mortality of 88 ± 8 % was observed after only 2 weeks, being twice the mortality in the laboratory microcolonies test (43 ± 11 %). Besides, it should be mentioned that in the greenhouse experiment all queens were dead and most of the workers showed signs of incoordination and convulsion and gradually became apathetic. In conclusion, our results demonstrated the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin with a range of lethal and sublethal effects, both crucial for the development and survival of the B. terrestris colonies.

Using a newly designed wind tunnel, we investigated the orientation behaviour of the bee towards two different odours: a social odour and a floral component, linalool. We then tested the effect of prior olfactory conditioning (conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex) on subsequent flight orientation. We showed that both stimuli induced orientated behaviour (orientated flights, circling around the odour source) in up to 70% of the worker bees, social odour being slightly more attractive than the linalool. We found thereafter that orientation performance towards the floral compound can be significantly enhanced by prior classical olfactory learning. This type of information transfer, from a Pavlovian associative context to an orientation task, might allow future foragers to acquire, within the hive, relevant information about the odours and food they will encounter during their later foraging bouts.","prior classical olfactory conditioning improves odour-cued flight orientation of honey","Odours are key cues used by the honey bee in"

For 16 populations along this gradient, we quantified composition of the pollinator assemblage, pollination efficiency and limitation, and reproductive output. The treelet has a generalized pollination system, but the hummingbird Sephanoides sephaniodes was the most effective pollinator. The relative importance of this hummingbird as a flower visitor within populations influenced pollen transfer and fruit set more strongly than local precipitation. As hummingbirds and other pollinators, including passerine birds and nemestrinid flies, were replaced by bees towards the dry eastern range limit, pollen limitation increased and reproduction eventually failed. These results support the hypothesis that pollinators can act as important biotic filters influencing plant distribution, and warn against predictions of geographical range shifts based solely on climatic variables.","erosion of a pollination mutualism along an environmental gradient in","The limit of a species distribution can be determined biotically"

In recent years, the practice has been identified as a risk factor for wild bumble bees in Europe and some researchers have claimed that it is causing environmental harm. The specific risks include competitive displacement of wild bumble bees, gene introgression, and the spread of disease. We have reviewed the scientific evidence on risk factors associated with managed colonies of B. terrestris in Europe, and we highlight the strengths, weaknesses and gaps in the current knowledge base. In contrast to other reports, we conclude that there is currently not enough reliable, consistent evidence to support claims that the current use of managed B. terrestris in Europe is harmful to wild populations of B. terrestris and other bumble bees, and therefore the issue remains unresolved. In the case of disease risks in particular, there is conflicting evidence published by some researchers on the prevalence of pathogens in managed colonies versus audited data published by one of the main bumble bee producers. The current lack of consistent evidence makes it difficult for government regulators to make informed risk assessments, and we argue that more work is needed to demonstrate both the reproducibility of published findings and to understand the mechanisms of action of risk effects. Recommendations are made for future work to better understand if the proposed risks are occurring in practice and to put in place preventative measures and mitigations if required.","are there risks to wild european bumble bees from using","Mass produced colonies of the Eurasian bumble bee, Bombus terrestris"

The rate of behavioural development is highly plastic and responsive to changes in colony condition such that forager losses, disease or nutritional stresses accelerate behavioural development and cause an early onset of foraging in workers. It is not clear to what degree the behavioural development of workers can be accelerated without there being a cost in terms of reduced foraging performance. Here, we compared the foraging performance of bees induced to accelerate their behavioural development by treatment with the juvenile hormone analogue methoprene with that of controls that developed at a normal rate. Methoprene treatment accelerated the onset of both flight and foraging behaviour in workers, but it also reduced foraging span, the total time spent foraging and the number of completed foraging trips. Methoprene treatment did not alter performance in a short-range navigation task, however. These data indicate a limitation to the physiological plasticity of bees, and a trade off between forager performance and the speed at which bees begin foraging. Chronic stressors will be expected to reduce the mean age of the foraging force, and therefore also reduce the efficiency of the foraging force. This interaction may explain why honey bee colonies react to sustained stressors with non-linear population decline. © 2015 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.","effects of the juvenile hormone analogue methoprene on rate of","Worker honey bees change roles as they age as part"

Ex Tan.) and 'Afourer' mandarin [C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck x C. reticulata Blanco] is increasing in California as consumers' interest in seedless, easy peeling, and good tasting mandarins increases. The fruit would produce seeds if cross-pollination with compatible pollen source occurred. It is almost impossible to prevent cross-pollination between compatible mandarin cultivars by honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) within the multi-faceted agricultural environment in California. To produce seedless mandarin, growers either plant a single cultivar in a large solid block or try to use pollen-sterile navel oranges (C. sinensis) or satsuma mandarins (C. unshiu Marco.) as buffers to prevent cross-pollination. The question of how many rows of buffer trees or spacing can effectively prevent cross-pollination by honeybees between compatible mandarins is unclear. We initiated a study using fluorescent-labeled AFLP markers to determine the pollen parentages of 'Nules' clementine seedlings and 'Afourer' mandarin seedlings from two orchards in California. The longest distance of pollen flow at an orchard near Madera was 521 m. The pollen of 'Minneola' tangelo (C. reticulata x C. paradisi Macf.) was able to disperse across a minimum of 92 rows of 'Lane Late' navel oranges plus two rows of 'Afourer' mandarins to pollinate 'Afourer' mandarins. We also found that all the seedlings of 'Nules' clementine mandarin at an orchard near Bakersfield had been pollinated by 'Afourer' mandarin pollen.

The popularity of stingless beekeeping has resulted in large-scale anthropogenic movements of nests, sometimes from outside their native range. Colony movement has the potential to impact local populations via transfer of parasites and pathogens and gene flow across unnaturally large geographic scales. Tetragonula carbonaria is the most widespread and commonly kept stingless bee species in Australia. Concerns have been raised that large-scale artificial propagation of T. carbonaria colonies by Sydney beekeepers, from a small number of colonies that originated in south-east Queensland, may have two consequences. First, the managed population may be becoming increasingly inbred. Second, the wild population may be experiencing significant introgression of south-east Queensland genotypes, potentially diluting local adaptations to the Sydney environment and resulting in the loss of local alleles. Here we show, based on microsatellite and mitochondrial markers, that both the managed and wild Sydney populations are significantly different from the south-east Queensland population. Nonetheless there is evidence that introgression of south-east Queensland alleles is impacting the genetic structure of both wild and managed Sydney populations. The two Sydney populations are indistinguishable, suggesting two-way gene flow in Sydney consistent with expectations of gene flow via male dispersal.

Therefore, colonies shared flower patches randomly with other colonies, suggesting that worker scent-marks deterring visits to unrewarding flowers have not evolved as signals benefiting nestmates.

The average number of colonies (95% confidence limits) sending workers to forage at sites of ≈ 1 ha in area was 96 colonies (84-118) in B. terrestris and 66 colonies (61-76) in B. pascuorum. These values are surprisingly high and suggested that workers travelled far from their colonies to visit the sites. At the landscape scale, there was little or no genetic differentiation between sites. We conclude that urban habitats support large bumble bee populations and are potentially valuable in terms of bumble bee conservation. In addition, bumble bee-mediated gene flow in plants is likely to occur over large distances and plant-bumble bee conservation requires landscape-scale action.","genetic analysis of spatial foraging patterns and resource sharing in","Conservation biologists, evolutionary ecologists and agricultural biologists require an improved"

European honeybee wax proved to be a versatile and practical medium for casting the digging as it was robust to transportation, required no added liquid or onsite preparation and was easily melted and poured. Although solid, the resulting cast was not brittle and was not damaged during excavation, transportation and measurement. The volume of the cast was quickly and easily determined via weighing, fluid displacement and photogrammetry and the three volume measures varied by only 3%. The primary value of the cast was that it could be inverted and placed under a good light source for close examination, measurement and photography. The digital model of the digging was visually detailed and instantaneously showed measurements, including volume, surface area and maximum length, width and depth. Mechanical and photogrammetric linear measurements made on the surface of the cast and digital model were statistically identical. The principal cost of the digital modelling was the time required to learn to use the software and complete the modelling (42.5 hours). Therefore, this technique may only be feasible for studies of close range morphology or where parameters that can not otherwise be easily obtained, such as surface area and contours, are required.","application and efficiency of beeswax casting and digital photogrammetry to","This project assessed the value of wax casting, digital modelling"

In addition, as social haplodiploids, inbred bees may be vulnerable to the extra genetic load represented by the production of sterile diploid males. Using microsatellite markers, we investigated the genetic structure of populations of the Great Yellow Bumblebee (Bombus distinguendus Morawitz) in the UK, where this species has undergone a precipitous decline. By means of a mixture of analytical methods and simulation, we also extended - and then applied - genetic methods for estimating foraging distance and nest density in wild bees. B. distinguendus populations were characterized by low expected heterozygosity and allelic richness, inbreeding coefficients not significantly different from zero, absence of detected diploid males, absence of substantial demographic bottlenecking, and population substructuring at large (c. 100+ km) but not small (10s of km) spatial scales. The minimum average effective population size at our sampling sites was low (c. 25). In coastal grassland (machair), the estimated modal foraging distance of workers was 391 m, with 95% of foraging activity occurring within 955 m of the nest, and estimated nest density was 19.3 nests km-2. These findings show that B. distinguendus exhibits some genetic features of scarce, declining or fragmented populations. Moreover, B. distinguendus workers appear to forage over above-average distances and nests remain thinly distributed even in current strongholds.

Returning foragers recruit nest mates to a food source by communicating flight distance and direction using a small scale walking pattern: the waggle dance. It is still unclear how bees transpose flight information to generate corresponding dance information. In single feeder shift experiments, we monitored for the first time how individual bees update dance duration after a shift of feeder distance. Interestingly, the majority of bees (86%) needed two or more foraging trips to update dance duration. This finding demonstrates that transposing flight navigation information to dance information is not a reflexive behavior. Furthermore, many bees showed intermediate dance durations during the update process, indicating that honey bees highly likely use two memories: (i) a recently acquired navigation experience and (ii) a previously stored flight experience. Double-shift experiments, in which the feeder was moved forward and backward, created an experimental condition in which honey bee foragers did not update dance duration; suggesting the involvement of more complex memory processes. Our behavioral paradigm allows the dissociation of foraging and dance activity and opens the possibility of studying the molecular and neural processes underlying the waggle dance behavior. © 2019.

During the wall-following task, the CFLC inputs measure the distance between the ultrasonic sensors and the wall, and the outputs of the CFLC are the robot's left-wheel and right-wheel speeds. A cost function is defined to evaluate the performance of the CFLC in the wall-following task. The cost function includes three control factors (CF) which are defined as follows: maintaining a user-defined robot-wall distance, avoiding robot-wall collision, and ensuring that the robot can successfully negotiate the venue. The original artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) simulates the intelligent foraging behavior of honey-bee swarms, which are good at exploration but poor at exploitation. An improved ABC algorithm, the IABC algorithm, is proposed that adopts the mutation strategies of differential evolution to balance exploration and exploitation. The IABC algorithm applies a new reward-based roulette wheel selection where an obtained a better solution by gains a reward during the learning stage.

An interesting candidate to study this question is the honey bee Apis cerana, a keystone pollinator with a wide distribution throughout a large variety of climates, that exhibits rapid dispersal. Here, we resequenced the genome of 180 A. cerana individuals from 18 populations throughout China. Using a population genomics approach, we observed considerable genetic variation in A. cerana. Patterns of genetic differentiation indicate high divergence at the subspecies level, and physical barriers rather than distance are the driving force for population divergence. Estimations of divergence time suggested that the main branches diverged between 300 and 500 Ka. Analyses of the population history revealed a substantial influence of the Earth's climate on the effective population size of A. cerana, as increased population sizes were observed during warmer periods. Further analyses identified candidate genes under natural selection that are potentially related to honey bee cognition, temperature adaptation, and olfactory. Based on our results, A. cerana may have great potential in response to climate change.

As such, the daily in-and-out activity of a beehive could be automatically recorded with minimum interference with the regular behavior of the bees. The components of the imaging system include: (1) an infrared LED light source; (2) an infrared CCD camera and a personal computer for image acquisition and processing; and (3) an acrylic passageway to temporarily confine the bees within the image-capturing range of the camera. In operation, this imaging system was affixed to the outside of a beehive at the entry/exit point. To identify each forager of bee workers individually, circular character-encoding tags were attached to the dorsum of the bees' thoraxes. To locate individual honey bees in a video frame, a circular Hough transform was used to detect the presence of the circular tags. A black positioning dot on the tag was used to identify the orientation of the characters in order to facilitate the reading of the symbols on the circular tag. The extracted character symbols were further segmented and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was deployed to recognize the characters and identify the individual honey bee. The system developed in this study was used in experimentation to identify each of the tagged bees and to record the timing of the entries and exits. The character symbol recognition and identification accuracy rates of the system were about 98% and 86%, respectively. Based on the in-and-out records, daily foraging behavior of honey bees were analyzed and presented.

The proposed M2OBA extend original artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to multi-objective and cooperative mode by combining external archive, comprehensive learning, greedy selection, crowding distance, and cooperative search strategy. Our algorithm uses the concept of Pareto dominance and comprehensive learning mechanism to determine the flight direction of a bee and maintains nondominated solution vectors in external archive based on greedy selection and crowing distance strategies. With cooperative search approaches, the single population ABC has been extended to interacting multi-hive model by constructing colony-level interaction topology and information exchange strategies. With six mathematical benchmark functions, M2OBA is proved to have significantly better performance than three successful multi-objective optimizers, namely the fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), the multi-objective particle swarm optimizer (MOPSO), and the multi-objective ABC (MOABC), for solving complex multi-objective optimization problems. M2OBA is then used for solving the real-world OPF problem that considers the cost, loss, and emission impacts as the objective functions.

The objective of this research was to determine the environmental toxicity of insecticides, spanning five different modes of action used to control D. citri, to A. mellifera. The insecticides investigated were imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate, spinetoram and diflubenzuron. In laboratory experiments, LD50 values were determined and ranged from 0.10 to 0.53 ng/mu l for imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate and spinetoram. LD50 values for diflubenzuron were > 1000 ng/mu l. Also, a hazard quotient was determined and ranged from 1130.43 to 10893.27 for imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate, and spinetoram. This quotient was < 0.447 for diflubenzuron. In field experiments, residual activity of fenpropathrin and dimethoate applied to citrus caused significant mortality of A. mellifera 3 and 7 days after application. Spinetoram and imidacloprid were moderately toxic to A. mellifera at the recommended rates for D. citri.

Estimations of insect-mediated gene dispersal would be valuable for managing potential escapes of transgenes. 2. To quantify the intensity and spatial scale of pollen dispersal by insect pollinators in an agricultural landscape, bait points made of flowering male-sterile OSR that attract OSR pollinators were located at six distances (10-1100m) from the closest OSR fields and feral populations. Flower-visiting insects were caught by net on these male-sterile flowers and were rubbed onto the stigmas of male-sterile OSR plants grown in a pollen-proof greenhouse to do a manual pollination of their flowers. In this way we were able to assess the insects' OSR pollen load and seed production at each of the six distances. 3. A large diversity of insects carried OSR pollen and contributed to seed production, but not pollen beetles Meligethes aeneus. Logistic regression analyses of the seed-set success from the manual pollination demonstrated that seed set significantly increased with the proximity of OSR fields, the size of the pollinating insect, and the main daily temperature. Seed set was not affected by the pollinating insect's order or genus. Seed set, both observed and predicted by the model, was above zero for flowers pollinated with large bees caught at >1100m from the nearest OSR field. 4. Synthesis and applications.Our study provides clear evidence that a large variety of insect species can transfer viable pollen between OSR plants over considerable distances. However, only 39·4% of the insects caught on male-sterile flowers carried OSR pollen.

This difference became even greater if the bee had had a run of several short or several long handling times. (2) Constant flights (those between flowers of the same species) and transition flights (those between flowers of different species) followed stereotyped temporal patterns independent of the distances between flowers. Constant flights within live plant species consistently had median durations of about 2 seconds, whereas median transition times between species took 3-6 seconds. (3) This temporal rule broke down, however, if the flowers of two species had similar colors, in which case transition flights had equal dynamics as constant flights. (4) Bees switched more frequently from rare than horn common species but even more frequently between similar species. We conclude that the bees' choices were determined by a set of rules that guided them to stay with the current plant species as long as flowers were rewarding and available within close distance but to switch to another species if flowers offered low rewards or were not encountered at close range.","foraging dynamics of bumble bees: correlates of movements within and","What rules determine whether bumble bees continue exploiting plants of"

Bumblebee foragers show diurnal rhythms under daily light:dark cycles and short-period free-running circadian rhythms in constant light conditions in the laboratory. In contrast, during the continuous light conditions of the arctic summer, they show robust 24-h rhythms in their foraging patterns, meaning that some external zeitgeber must entrain their circadian clocks in the presence of constant light. Although the sun stays above the horizon for weeks during the arctic summer, the light quality, especially in the ultraviolet (UV) range, exhibits pronounced daily changes. Since the photoreceptors and photopigments that synchronize the circadian system of bees are not known, we tested if the circadian clocks of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) can be entrained by daily cycles in UV light levels. Bumblebee colonies were set up in the laboratory and exposed to 12 h:12 h UV + :UV- cycles in otherwise continuous lighting conditions by placing UV filters on their foraging arenas for 12 h each day. The activity patterns of individual bees were recorded using fully automatic radiofrequency identification (RFID). We found that colonies manipulated in such a way showed synchronized 24-h rhythms, whereas simultaneously tested control colonies with no variation in UV light levels showed free-running rhythms instead.

The method involves Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection of hypocotyl explants, followed by the production of antibiotic- or herbicide-resistant embryogenic callus and the subsequent induction of somatic embryos and plants. Key elements of the improvement are the use of buffering agents to stabilise medium pH and bottom-cooling of the cultures. Transformation was verified by PCR and Southern blot hybridisation. Transcription of transgenes was confirmed by RT-PCR and product sequencing. Expression of transgenes was detected by histochemical GUS staining, phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT) enzyme assays for bar and pat genes, and western analysis of transgenic sunflower seed albumin protein. Expression of various transgenes was detected in stem, leaf, seed, capsule and latex. The pat gene was demonstrated to be stably inherited to the T 2 generation and to confer phosphinothricin (PPT) herbicide resistance. Most T0 plants showed normal morphology, were self-fertile and the transgenes displayed the expected Mendelian segregation. The percentage of explants producing somatic embryos that developed into plantlets able to be transplanted to soil, ranged from 6-11% in two Tasmanian cultivars. A field trial using pat transgenic plants was designed to estimate the frequency of hybridisation at various distances into buffer rows of non-transgenic poppies and to related weed species, P. somniferum spp. setigerum and P. dubium. The frequency of hybridisation to completely compatible poppy fell sharply with distance, being 2.6% at 20 cm, 2.13% at 0.5 m and falling to 0% at 2.5 and 5 m. No hybridisation could be detected to two weed species under open pollination conditions, including the compatible P. somniferum spp. setigerum, when grown as close as 20 cm, despite flowering at the same time as the transgenic plants in the presence of foraging bees.","genetic transformation in commercial tasmanian cultivars of opium poppy, papaver","We report a new transformation protocol for the pharmaceutically important"

The diversity of understory honey plants determines visitation rate of pollinators such as honey bee (Apis mellifera) as they provide rich food resources. Since the flower visitation and foraging activity of pollinators lead to the provision of pollination service, it also means the enhancement of plant-pollinator relationship. Therefore, an appropriate management scheme for understory vegetation is essential in order to conserve pollinator population that is decreasing due to habitat destruction and disease infection. This research examined the diversity of understory honey plant and studied how it is related to environmental variables such as (1) canopy density, (2) horizontal heterogeneity of canopy surface height, (3) slope gradient, and (4) distance from roads. Vegetation survey data of 39 plots of mixed forests in Chuncheon, Korea, were used, and possible management practices for understory vegetation were suggested. Results: This study found that 113 species among 141 species of honey plant of the forests were classified as understory vegetation. Also, the understory honey plant diversity is significantly positively correlated with distance from the nearest road and horizontal heterogeneity of canopy surface height and negatively correlated with canopy density. Conclusions: The diversity of understory honey plant vegetation is correlated to vegetation structure and human impact. In order to enhance the diversity of understory honey plant, management of density and height of canopy is necessary. This study suggests that improved diversity of canopy cover through thinning of overstory vegetation can increase the diversity of understory honey plant species. © The Author(s). 2017.","effects of vegetation structure and human impact on understory honey","Background: Though the biomass of floral vegetation in understory plant"

The objective of this study was to assess the abundance and richness of wild bee species throughout a small city in northwest Pennsylvania and identify how management of land throughout the city may influence bee communities. Seventeen sites across a land use gradient, moving from areas with large open spaces and mainly permeable surfaces, to sites in the city center consisting of mainly impermeable surfaces, were sampled over a 2-year period. During this time, 106 known species were identified with four state records and 1 undescribed species. Bee species richness was greatest at sites with the largest amount of permeable surface and naturally-occurring, native vegetation. Richness decreased on the college campus and city center where landscapes were highly managed and impermeable surfaces were most abundant. While floral richness was not related to bee abundance and richness, the number of open blooms near traps did have a positive impact on bee species richness. Overall, this survey revealed considerable richness never before recorded for northwest Pennsylvania, suggesting the importance of conservation management in homeowner and community yard space.","wild bee species abundance and richness across an urban-rural gradient","Long-term and widespread monitoring programs are essential to understanding the"

A survey was undertaken to understand clonal effects on fine-scale genetic structure (FSGS) in two populations (one from a disturbed and the other from an undisturbed locality) of Echinosophora koreensis, an endangered small shrub belonging to a monotypic genus in central Korea that reproduces both sexually and vegetatively via rhizomes. • Methods: Using inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) as genetic markers, the spatial distribution of individuals was evaluated using Ripley's L(d)-statistics and quantified the spatial scale of clonal spread and spatial distribution of ISSR genotypes using spatial autocorrelation analysis techniques (join-count statistics and kinship coefficient, Fij) for total samples and samples excluding clones. • Key Results: A high degree of differentiation between populations was observed (ΦST(g) = 0.184, P &lt; 0.001). Ripley's L(d)-statistics revealed a near random distribution of individuals in a disturbed population, whereas significant aggregation of individuals was found in an undisturbed site. The join-count statistics revealed that most clones significantly aggregate at ≤6-m interplant distance. The Sp statistic reflecting patterns of correlograms revealed a strong pattern of FSGS for all four data sets (Sp = 0.072-0.154), but these patterns were not significantly different from each other. At small interplant distances (≤2 m), however, jackknifed 95 % CIs revealed that the total samples exhibited significantly higher Fij values than the same samples excluding clones. • Conclusion: The strong FSGS from genets is consistent with two biological and ecological traits of E. koreensis: bee-pollination and limited seed dispersal. Furthermore, potential clone mates over repeated generations would contribute to the observed high Fij values among genets at short distance. To ensure long-term ex situ genetic variability of the endangered E. koreensis, individuals located at distances of 10-12 m should be collected across entire populations of E. koreensis. © The Author 2006.

Recently, a honeybee pest, the small hive beetle Aethina tumida (hereafter SHB), has been reported in Italy, where it colonized more than 50 apiaries in an area of about 300 km 2 . SHB is a nest parasite and scavenger of honeybee colonies native of Sub-Saharian Africa. Likely being helped by the globalization of apiculture, SHB underwent several invasions in the last twenty years, causing locally relevant economic impact. While many features of its biology have been addressed, an important knowledge gap concerns the spatial invasion dynamics in invaded areas. In this paper we coupled two spatial analysis techniques (geographic profiling and a density-based spatial clustering algorithm) to uncover the possible invasion pattern of SHB in Italy. We identified the port town of Gioia Tauro as the most likely point from which SHB may have spread and suggested the possible successive axes of diffusion. These putative diffusion paths suggest that the SHB spread in south Italy might have been due to a mix of natural dispersal between close apiaries and longer distance movement through faster, likely human-mediated, communication routes. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Entomologia","uncovering the spatial pattern of invasion of the honeybee pest","The fast tracking of invasion spatial patterns of alien species"

We found little evidence of autogamy in emasculated inflorescences, and though trees were self-compatible, protandry within inflorescences and synchrony of flowering on branch systems were effective at preventing self-fertilization. Pollen was poorly dispersed by wind, and no pollen was found on traps 8 m from source trees. Although numerous insects visited inflorescences, only bees in the families Apidae and Halictidae carried more than traces of pollen. Both the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera, and native bees carried large amounts of pollen, and native bees dominated the visitor community at three of four study sites.

Pollinators utilise different habitats to meet resource requirements throughout their life-span and it is widely accepted that their conservation requires a landscape-scale approach. Information on the mechanisms driving insect pollinators at the landscape scale is, however, lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, this novel study explores how pollinators utilise different habitats within a landscape and how utilisation changes over the season. Floral resources and insect pollinators (i.e. bumblebee, butterflies and hoverflies) were monitored during peak pollinator activity periods on a wide range of agricultural and semi-natural habitats in an intensive grassland landscape. The availability of key foraging resources differed between semi-natural habitats and this was strongly linked to their utilisation by pollinators. Floral resources were most abundant and diverse in road verges, riparian buffer strips and open scrub. These were key habitats for butterflies, with road verges and buffer strips also being important for hoverflies and bumblebees. The relative value of semi-natural habitats in providing floral resources changed throughout the season. Pollinators appeared to respond to changes in key floral resources, dynamically using different semi-natural habitats to meet their requirements. Maintaining landscape heterogeneity and improving the quality of semi-natural habitats to ensure resource diversity and continuity is fundamental to pollinator conservation. Regionally targeting agri-environment spending could result in the simplification of agricultural landscapes with consequences on insect pollinators and biodiversity as a whole. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","exploring the interactions between resource availability and the utilisation of","Intensification of agriculture and associated loss of habitat heterogeneity is"

By enhancing habitat heterogeneity and ecological connectivity, riparian buffer strips have the potential to promote insect pollinators in intensively managed landscapes. Insect pollinators and flowering plants were investigated on a range of riparian margins, and their adjacent grassland fields, to determine the main physical and botanical attributes driving pollinator diversity.Irrespective of whether they were fenced or not, riparian margins had richer plant assemblages and supported more pollinators than grassland fields. While the erection of fences did not enhance the richness or diversity of flowers, fenced riparian buffer strips supported more even and diverse assemblages of bumblebees and a greater number of butterflies than unfenced riparian margins. More bumblebees and butterflies were recorded in wide buffer strips (i.e. over 5. m wide) than in unfenced margins or narrow buffer strips (i.e. ≤3.5. m wide) and butterfly assemblages in wide buffer strips were richer and more diverse. There was a strong positive relationship between floral resources and the abundance, richness and diversity of bumblebee and butterfly assemblages. Pollinators only foraged on a small number of the flower species present and impacts of fencing and buffer strip width could not solely be attributed to the area and/or species richness of flowers.Fenced riparian buffer strips, particularly when over 5. m wide, have the potential to provide resources for insect pollinators in intensively grazed systems. Management to enhance floristic diversity (to provide a more continuous supply of pollen and nectar) and tussock forming grasses (to provide shelter for pollinators and nesting locations for bumblebees) could further increase their value to insect pollinators. In grassland systems, restricted grazing is easier to implement than mowing. It is, however, important that grazing management does not unduly interfere with other ecosystem services derived from riparian buffer strips (e.g. diffuse pollution mitigation). Widespread fencing of watercourses at the catchment level could result in the simplification of these inherently dynamic and complex habitats. Buffer strips should therefore be strategically placed to optimise benefits such as ecological connectivity and diffuse pollution mitigation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","riparian buffer strips: their role in the conservation of insect","There is growing concern that the global decline of insect"

The duration of morning and evening foraging was significantly positively correlated both within and across seasons-some colonies have a consistent advantage in foraging. The temperature range over which colonies foraged was also consistent across time, suggesting that intercolony differences are a consequence of variation in the thermal ranges/preferences of the colony's workers.

However, whereas extensive electrophysiological studies have been undertaken over the past ten years to characterize ionic currents underlying the physiological neuronal activity in honeybee, ionic currents underlying skeletal muscle fibre activity in this insect remain, so far, unexplored. Here, we show that, in contrast to many other insect species, action potentials in muscle fibres isolated from adult honeybee metathoracic tibia, are not graded but actual all-or-none responses. Action potentials are blocked by Cd2+ and La3+ but not by tetrodotoxin (TTX) in current-clamp mode of the patch-clamp technique, and as assessed under voltage-clamp, both Ca2+ and K+ currents are involved in shaping action potentials in single muscle fibres. The activation threshold potential for the voltage-dependent Ca2+ current is close to -40 mV, its mean maximal amplitude is -8.5±1.9 A/F and the mean apparent reversal potential is near +40 mV. In honeybees, GABA does not activate any ionic membrane currents in muscle fibres from the tibia, but L-glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular synapse induces fast activation of an inward current when the membrane potential is voltage clamped close to its resting value. Instead of undergoing desensitization as is the case in many other preparations, a component of this glutamate-activated current has a sustained component, the reversal potential of which is close to 0 mV, as demonstrated with voltage ramps. Future investigations will allow extensive pharmacological characterization of membrane ionic currents and excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle from honeybee, a useful insect that became a model to study many physiological phenomena and which plays a major role in plant pollination and in stability of environmental vegetal biodiversity.","excitable properties of adult skeletal muscle fibres from the honeybee","In the hive, a wide range of honeybees tasks such"

They thus obtain similar views of the nest and its surroundings on their learning and return flights. How do bees coordinate their flights relative to nest-based and compass-based reference frames to get such similar views? We show, first, that learning and return flights contain straight segments that are directed along particular compass bearings, which are independent of the orientation of a bee's body. Bees are thus free within limits to adjust their viewing direction relative to the nest, without disturbing flight direction. Second, we examine the coordination of nest-based and compassbased control during likely information gathering segments of these flights: Loops during learning flights and zigzags on return flights. We find that bees tend to start a loop or zigzag when flying within a restricted range of compass directions and to fly towards the nest and face it after a fixed change in compass direction, without continuous interactions between their nest-based and compass-based directions of flight. A preferred trajectory of compass-based flight over the course of a motif, combined with the tendency of the bees to keep their body oriented towards the nest automatically narrows the range of compass directions over which bees view the nest. Additionally, the absence of interactions between the two reference frames allows loops and zigzags to have a stereotyped form that can generate informative visual feedback. © 2013.

"3407","Collett, TS","insect navigation en route to the goal: multiple strategies for the use of landmarks",1996,"JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY","","There are at least four distinct ways in which familiar landmarks aid an insect on its trips between nest and foraging site. Recognising scenes: when bees are displaced unexpectedly from their hive to one of several familiar locations, they are able to head in the direction of home as though they had previously linked an appropriate directional vector to a view of the scene at the release site. Biased detours: ants recognise familiar landmarks en route and will correct their path by steering consistently to the left or to the right around them. Aiming at beacons: bees and ants also guide their path by approaching familiar landmarks lying on or close to the direct line between start and finish. Simulations suggest that such mechanisms acting together may suffice to account for the routes taken by desert ants through a landmark-strewn environment: the stereotyped trajectories of individual ants call be modelled by a weighted combination of dead reckoning, biased detours and beacon-aiming. These mechanisms guide an insect sufficiently close to an inconspicuous goal for image matching to be successfully employed to locate it. Insects then move until their current retinal image matches a stored view of the surrounding panorama seen from a vantage point close to the goal. Bees and wasps perform learning flights on their first departure from a site to which they will return, These flights seem to be designed to pick up the information needed for several navigational strategies. Thus, a large portion of the learning flight of a bee leaving a feeder tends to be spent close to the feeder so aiding the acquisition of a view from that vantage point, as is needed for image matching. Bees and social wasps also tend to inspect their surroundings while facing along preferred directions and to adopt similar bearings before landing, thereby making it easy to employ retinotopically stored patterns in image matching. Aiming at beacons, in contrast, requires a landmark to be familiar to the frontal retina. Objects tend to be viewed frontally while the insect circles through arcs centred on the goal. This procedure may help insects to pick out those objects close to the goal that are best suited for guiding later returns.","insect navigation en route to the goal: multiple strategies for","There are at least four distinct ways in which familiar"

D. ferruginea proved to be very attractive for bumblebees, aggregating a large number of foragers (up to two bumblebees per inflorescence at the foraging peak). The number of active bees showed a positive correlation (P < 0.01) with temperature. On windy days, flight distances were longer downwind than upwind (P = 0.0194), while on calm days or in gentle wind the bees made long flights upwind as well as downwind. In two subunits of the patch, differing in plant density, a larger number (P = 0.0026) of bees foraged in the high plant density unit, and a lower infloescence/bee ratio (P = 0.0367) was found there. The estimated total number of bees foraging at any one time in the two patch subunits differed significantly (5 out of 7 times, P < 0.01 or < 0.05) from the values expected if the bees were distributed in proportion to the number of inflorescences in each patch. Bees foraged within individual undefended and interlaced areas, and flight routes within these areas were maintained for up to at least 10 days. When part of their foraging area was screened by bagging some plants, the workers did not leave the patch, but most of them responded by visiting some adjacent plants or plant groups. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","patch use by bumblebees (hymenoptera apidae): temperature, wind, flower density","The foraging behaviour of the bumblebees Bombus hortorum (Linnaeus)/ Bombus"

While temporal variation in pollinator composition has been widely reported, spatial variability, particularly on a local scale, has been studied less frequently; nevertheless, available evidence suggests that local spatial variability may be a widespread feature of plant-pollinator interactions. In addition, the causes of this spatial variability are poorly known. This study was undertaken to quantify variability in the taxonomic composition of pollinators visiting local populations of black mustard, Brassica nigra, and to determine some of the causes of this variability. Simultaneous observations were conducted in seven pairs of black mustard populations. The members of each pair were in close spatial proximity but differed in number of plants. Larger plant populations were visited by significantly greater numbers of honey bees and significantly fewer small bees than small populations on a per-plant basis. There was also a trend toward greater syrphid fly visitation in small populations. The increased numbers of honey bees at large plant populations is probably due to their ability to recruit long distances to the most rewarding plant populations. The lower number of small bees at large plant populations may be due to competition from honey bees and/or spreading a constant number of small bees over the larger number of plants in large populations.","effects of black mustard population-size on the taxonomic composition of","In plant species that are pollinated by a variety of"

Dietary specialisation, specifically on flowers of Fabaceae, has been hypothesised as driving differential declines but the reliability of previous studies has been questioned. Here we present a 3-year study of the foraging behaviour of two UK Biodiversity Action Plan bumblebee species. For the first time, analysis of nectar and pollen foraging was performed on sites where nationally rare UK bumblebees were as abundant as more nationally ubiquitous species. Results indicated that the nationally rare Bombus sylvarum collected the majority of its pollen from flowers of Odontites verna and had a significantly narrower mean nectar dietary breadth than ecologically similar species Bombus humilis and Bombus pascuorum (p = 0.004 and 0.008, respectively). In contrast, the dietary breadth of the nationally rare B. humilis was similar to the more nationally ubiquitous species B. pascuorum and Bombus lapidarius. Moreover, B. lapidarius was recorded as having the narrowest pollen dietary breadth, collected pollen from the least number of floral taxa and was the most specialised of the Bombus species on pollen of Fabaceae. Patterns of dietary specialisation were inconsistent with national declines and results highlighted a need for further detailed investigation into the factors contributing to differential declines.

Most ground-nesting bee and wasp studies implement trapping methods that capture foraging individuals, but provide little insight into the nesting preferences of these taxa. Some researchers have suggested that emergence traps may provide a suitable means by which to determine ground-nesting bee and wasp abundance. We sought to evaluate nest-site selection of ground-nesting bees and wasps using emergence traps in two study systems: (1) planted wildflower enhancement plots and fallow control plots in agricultural land; and (2) upland pine and hammock habitat in forests. Over the course of three years (2015-2017), we collected 306 ground-nesting bees and wasps across all study sites from emergence traps. In one study, we compared captures per trap between coloured pan traps and emergence traps and found that coloured pan traps captured far more ground-nesting bees and wasps than did emergence traps. Based on our emergence trap data, our results also suggest ground-nesting bees and wasps are more apt to nest within wildflower enhancement plots than in fallow control plots, and in upland pine habitats than in hammock forests. In conclusion, emergence traps have potential to be a unique tool to gain understanding of ground-nesting bee and wasp habitat requirements.","evaluation of nest-site selection of ground-nesting bees and wasps (hymenoptera)","Approximately 70% of the 30 000 known bee (Hymenoptera) species"

Insects are among the organisms with the largest diversity in urbanized environments. Here, we sampled predator (Ampulicidae, Sphecidae and Crabronidae) and parasitoid (Tachinidae) flower-visiting insects in 36 sites in the city of Rome (Italy). Although the diversity of herbivorous insects in urban areas mostly depends on the availability of flowering plants and nesting sites, predators and parasitoids generally require a larger number of resources during their life cycle, and are expected to be particularly influenced by urbanization. As flower-visitors can easily move between habitat patches, the effect of urbanization was tested at multiple spatial scales (local, landscape and sub-regional). We found that urbanization influenced predator and parasitoid flower-visitors at all three spatial scales. At the local scale, streets and buildings negatively influenced evenness of predators and species richness and abundance of parasitoids probably acting as dispersal barrier. At the landscape scale, higher percentage of urban decreased predator abundance, while increasing their evenness, suggesting an increase in generalist and highly mobile species. Area and compactness (i.e. Contiguity index) of urban green interactively influenced predator communities, whereas evenness of parasitoids increased with increasing Contiguity index. At the sub-regional scale, species richness and abundance of predators increased with increasing distance from the city center. Compared to previous studies testing the effect of urbanization, we found little variation in species richness, abundance and evenness along our urbanization gradient. The current insect fauna has been probably selected for its tolerance to habitat loss and fragmentation, being the result of the intensive anthropogenic alteration occurred in the area in the last centuries. Conservation strategies aimed at predator and parasitoid flying insects have to take in account variables at multiple spatial-scales, as well as the complementarity of resources across the landscape. © 2019 Corcos et al.

The introduction of invasive species to the United States-whether deliberate or unintentional-from around the globe can pose a significant threat to native animal and plant communities, and may result in extinctions of native animals and plants, species disruptions as native and nonnative species compete for limited resources, reduced biodiversity, and altered terrestrial or aquatic habitats. This can result in a range of economic, ecologic, and cultural losses, including reduced agricultural output from U.S. farms and ranches; degradation of U.S. waterways, coastal areas, national parks, and forests; and altered urban, suburban, and rural landscapes. It is estimated that 50,000 non-native species have been introduced to the United States. The potential economic costs associated with nonindigenous plant and animal species are estimated at $129 billion annually in the United States. A few examples of the types of damages attributed to non-native invasive species in the United States are as follows. Burmese pythons are multiplying in south Florida, becoming a top carnivore and killing large numbers of native species of reptiles, birds, and mammals. Zebra and quagga mussels from Eastern Europe are clogging intakes for urban water supplies and nuclear power plants in the Great Lakes and the Mississippi basin. The light brown apple moth, a native pest of Australia, has been detected in California and is causing damage to a wide range of plant species and commercial fruit and vegetable crops. Leafy spurge is lowering the forage value of western grazing land, and reducing overall land values. In the United States, numerous federal and interagency efforts share responsibilities regarding invasive species. Among the federal agencies involved are the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, Interior, Transportation, and others, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Executive Office of the President. Of these, three Departments-Agriculture, Commerce, and Interior-play a major role by cochairing the National Invasive Species Council (NISC). Created by Executive Order 13112 in 1999, NISC provides high-level interdepartmental coordination of federal invasive species actions and works with other federal and nonfederal groups to address invasive species issues at the national level. In FY2012, the U.S. government spent an estimated $2.2 billion across a range of federal agencies and activities in an effort to prevent, control, and eradicate invasive species domestically. Activities at the Department of Agriculture accounted for the bulk of available federal funding, nearly $1.3 billion (58% of total available funds). Activities at the Department of Homeland Security, comprised of mostly border protection and security activities, accounted for about $0.7 billion (31% of total funding). The remainder of federal funding, about $0.2 billion (about 11% of total funding) covers activities across a range of agencies at the Departments of Interior, Commerce, and Defense, and also other independent agencies. Despite efforts to achieve high-level interdepartmental coordination, comprehensive legislation on the treatment of invasive species has never been enacted, and no single law provides coordination among federal agencies. Instead, the current legal framework is largely governed by a patchwork of laws, regulations, policies, and programs. Some laws are tailored to individual species or narrowly focused on what is affected by the species. Other laws have a broader intended purpose and may only peripherally address invasive species. Some laws, although they do not directly address invasive species control or prevention, may limit such introductions. An ""invasive"" species (alternatively known as an alien, exotic, injurious, introduced or naturalized, non-native, nonindigenous, nuisance, or noxious species) refers to an animal or plant that is introduced into an environment where it is not native.1 The introduction of invasive species to the United States-whether deliberate or unintentional-from around the globe can pose a significant threat to native animal and plant communities, and may result in extinctions of native animals and plants, species disruptions as native species compete for limited resources, reduced biodiversity, and altered terrestrial or aquatic habitats. It is estimated that 50,000 non-native species have been introduced to the United States, including nonindigenous plant and animal species (Table 1).2 Examples of some invasive species found in the United States, and the types of damages they may inflict, include the following: . Burmese pythons (Python bivitattus) have multiplied in south Florida, becoming a top carnivore and killing large numbers of native species of reptiles, birds, and mammals. . Brown tree snakes (Boiga irregularis) from the western Pacific continue to threaten power utilities and communications on Guam and the Northern Marianas, and threaten to invade Hawaii and harm its tourism industry. . Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) from Eastern Europe have clogged intakes for urban water supplies and nuclear power plants in the Great Lakes and the Mississippi basin. . Light brown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana), a native pest of Australia, has been detected in California and is causing damage to a wide range of plant species and commercial fruit and vegetable crops. . Lionfish (Pterois volitans), likely released from private aquaria in Florida, have spread north along the U.S. coast and also within the Caribbean. . Formosan termites (Coptotermes formosanus) have devastated living trees and historic buildings in the French Quarter of New Orleans. . Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) has reduced the forage value of western grazing land, resulting in lower overall value to private landowners. All 50 states and the U.S. territories have at least some invasive plants and animals. A few (e.g., Hawaii, Florida, Louisiana, the Great Lakes states, and California) have so many harmful non- natives as to cause major ecological and economic damage to a variety of locations and industries. This report provides an overview of the federal laws and directives in the United States that govern invasive species, and the role of selected federal agencies. A summary of selected laws and agencies is provided in Appendix A. The patchwork of laws that currently govern invasive species in the United States also contribute to fundamentally different approaches to regulate invasive species, which is beyond the scope of this report. In addition to the federal laws discussed in this report, invasive species are regulated and/or managed through a variety of statutes administered by the states, often with the cooperation of federal agencies. This report also does not address the extensive efforts of individual states to deal with invasive species concerns.3 Further, this report focuses primarily on invasive plant and animal species that may affect U.S. agriculture, waterways and coastal areas, national parks and forests, and various ecosystems and landscape environments. The potential for non-native species to adversely affect human health and disease is not addressed in this report. This report also does not address species introductions to the United States that are widely considered beneficial, such as certain crop plants (e.g., wheat, soybeans) and orchard fruit (e.g., apples, pears), as well as honey bees (Apis mellifera) and pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), among other introduced species. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We investigated this effect in the endangered, self-incompatible Australian daisy Rutidosis leptorhynchoides F. Muell. (Asteraceae) by quantifying the effect of plant density on pollinator visitation and seed set in a wild population. Pollinator activity was investigated by direct observation of insect behaviour, by examining the pollen carried on candidate insect species, by video monitoring of visitation, and by tracking the movement of dye as a pollen analogue. Two native Lasioglossum species (Hymenoptera: Halictidae) were identified as the most frequent pollen-carrying visitors to inflorescences. Their visitation was significantly higher where plants were dense, but no statistical correlation between seed set and plant density was found. Florivory was identified as potentially having a substantial negative influence on seed set, but without any clear relationship to plant density. Given that R. leptorhynchoides has declined substantially across its range, and previous reintroduction attempts have often failed, our findings provide key information pertaining to knowledge of pollinator and florivore behaviour in relation to plant density. To maximise success of future management strategies, these animal-plant interactions should be captured in species recovery designs.","local population density affects pollinator visitation in the endangered grassland","The spatial arrangement of plants has implications for their pollination."

Due to their environmental and economical consequences, invasive species are now a major concern. Social wasps are particularly efficient invaders because of their distinctive biology and behavior. Among them, the yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, is a keen hunter of domestic honeybees. Its recent introduction to Europe may induce important beekeeping, pollination, and biodiversity problems. Hornets use olfactory cues for the long-range detection of food sources, in this case the location of honeybee colonies, but the exact nature of these cues remains unknown. Here, we studied the orientation behavior of V. velutina workers towards a range of hive products and protein sources, as well as towards prominent chemical substances emitted by these food sources. In a multiple choice test performed under controlled laboratory conditions, we found that hornets are strongly attracted to the odor of some hive products, especially pollen and honey. When testing specific compounds, the honeybee aggregation pheromone, geraniol, proved highly attractive. Pheromones produced by honeybee larvae or by the queen were also of interest to hornet workers, albeit to a lesser extent. Our results indicate that V. velutina workers are selectively attracted towards olfactory cues from hives (stored food, brood, and queen), which may signal a high prey density. This study opens new perspectives for understanding hornets' hunting behavior and paves the way for developing efficient trapping strategies against this invasive species.","olfactory attraction of the hornet vespa velutina to honeybee colony","Since the beginning of the last century, the number of"

One communication system where these alternatives are debated is the honeybee (Apis mellifera) waggle dance. Successful foragers communicate resource locations to nest-mates by a dance comprising repeated units (waggle runs), which repetitively transmit the same distance and direction vector from the nest. Intra-dance waggle run variation occurs and has been hypothesized as a colony-level adaptation to direct recruits over an area rather than a single location. Alternatively, variation may simply be due to constraints on bees' abilities to orient waggle runs. Here, we ask whether the angle at which the bee dances on vertical comb influences waggle run variation. In particular, we determine whether horizontal dances, where gravity is not aligned with the waggle run orientation, are more variable in their directional component. We analysed 198 dances from foragers visiting natural resources and found support for our prediction. More horizontal dances have greater angular variation than dances performed close to vertical. However, there is no effect of waggle run angle on variation in the duration of waggle runs, which communicates distance. Our results weaken the hypothesis that variation is adaptive and provide novel support for the constraint hypothesis.

One novel source of data to evaluate AESs may be provided by an organism that itself may benefit from them. Honeybees (Apis mellifera), important pollinators for crops and wildflowers [8, 9], are declining in parts of the world from many factors, including loss of available forage from agricultural intensification [10-13].

The waggle dance, a unique behavior performed by successful foragers, communicates to nestmates the most profitable foraging locations [14-16].

Additionally, the two most visited areas contained a National and Local Nature Reserve, respectively. Our study demonstrates that honeybees, with their great foraging range and sensitive response to forage quality, can be used as bioindicators to monitor large areas and provide information relevant to better environmental management.

Primary infection gradients were longer downwind than upwind, with 95% of blighted shoots occurring within 30 m of the ascospore point source. This observation, along with a positive correlation (r = 0.852, P = 0.0072, n = 8) between the distance over which shoot blight occurred and wind speed parallel to the row, supports the role of wind as a key factor in ascospore dispersal. By contrast, secondary infection gradients were shorter downwind and longer upwind, with 95% of infected fruit occurring within 20 m of the conidial point source. The shorter downwind spread of secondary infection, along with a nonsignificant correlation (r = -0.649, P = 0.0812, n = 8) between the distance over which infected fruit occurred and wind speed, suggests that factors other than wind are important in the transfer of conidia to open flowers; this could include conidial dispersal by bee pollinators, which have been shown previously to forage primarily upwind. Exponential and Pareto cumulative distribution functions were fitted to cumulative counts of blighted shoots and infected fruit to model spread of primary and secondary infection. The Pareto model, which is characterized by a longer tail and predicts more infection farther from the inoculum source, better fits the observed disease gradients in most cases.","gradients of primary and secondary infection by monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi from","Spread of mummy berry disease of blueberry, caused by Monilinia"

The model may be applied to forage sources with various properties, and to colonies with different foraging-related parameters. In particular, we examine the effect of five foraging-related parameters on the foraging response and consequent nectar intake of a homogeneous colony. The parameters investigated affect different quantities critical to the foraging cycle - visit rate (affected by g), probability of dancing (mpd and bpd), duration of dancing (mcirc), or probability of abandonment (A). We show that one parameter, A, affects nectar intake in a nonlinear way. Further, we show that colonies with a midrange value of any foraging parameter perform better than the average of colonies with high- and low-range values, when profitable sources are available. Together these observations suggest that a heterogeneous colony, in which a range of parameter values are present, may perform better than a homogeneous colony. We modify the model to represent heterogeneous colonies and use it to show that the most important effect of heterogeneous foraging behaviour within the colony is to reduce the variance in the average quantity of nectar collected by heterogeneous colonies. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Artificially immobilised bees consumed more oxygen (averages: 7.4 and 6.9 μl O2.min-1 at 25° and 35°C, respectively) than spontaneously motionless bees but less than active, freely moving individuals. Oxygen measurements in immobilised honeybees, therefore, are neither suited to determine the basal rate of oxygen metabolism nor to estimate the energy turnover of highly active, freely moving individuals. As was expected from thermographical temperature measurements, oxygen consumption by bees which were free to move within 95 ml Warburg vessels varied in a wide range. At an ambient temperature of 25°C it followed a bimodal distribution, with one peak below 20 and a second peak between 70-130 μl O2.min-1. At 35°C oxygen consumption was always below 75 μl O2.min-1. However, considering the bees' level of activity led to a clear reduction of variability of data. Spontaneously motionless bees consumed on average 3.2 and 4.3 μl O2.min-1 at 25° and 35°C, respectively. In active bees the oxygen consumption rate was higher and related to the degree of activity and ambient temperature. Moderately active individuals consumed 48.4 μl O2.min-1 at 25°C and 18.3 μl O2.min-1 at 35°C. By contrast, fast walking bees had significantly higher oxygen consumption rates: 91.4 and 30.5 μl O2.min-1 at 25° and 35°C, respectively. Since running speed of the active bees was not distinguishable by eye and the distribution of observed behaviours was identical at 25 and 35°C but oxygen consumption was 2.64-3.15 times higher at 25°C, it can be concluded that more energy is invested in thermoregulation than in motion at both ambient temperatures. © 1999 E.

We used radio-frequency tags to track foraging activity of uniquely identified bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) workers, while simultaneously recording local wind flows. Despite being subjected to a wide range of speeds and turbulence intensities, we find that bees do not avoid foraging in windy conditions. We then examined the impacts of turbulence on bumblebee flight in a wind tunnel. Rolling instabilities increased in turbulence, but only at higher wind speeds. Bees displayed higher mean wingbeat frequency and stroke amplitude in these conditions, aswell as increased asymmetry in stroke amplitude— suggesting that bees employ an array of active responses to enable flight in turbulence, which may increase the energetic cost of flight. Our results provide the first direct evidence that moderate, environmentally relevant turbulence affects insect flight performance, and suggest that flying insects use diverse mechanisms to cope with these instabilities. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

To preserve a crop's varietal purity or to restrict ingress into conventional varieties of genetically modified (GM) genes, a quantitative understanding of gene flow is useful. Previous measurements of gene flow in safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), a crop with GM varieties, were made in plots of less than 1. ha. Here, I evaluate a mathematical model of field-to-field gene flow due to insect pollination using parameter values appropriate to a large agricultural field of safflower. The model was solved based on laboratory pollination experiments and observations made on a large (40. ha) safflower field in Lethbridge, Canada that was pollinated by honey bees (Apis mellifera) and bumble bees (Bombus spp.). The model estimated the maximum feasible level of bee-mediated, field-to-field gene flow to range between 0.05% and 0.005% of seed set (95% upper confidence intervals of 0.23% and 0.023%), depending on the composition of the bee fauna. These relatively low values emerged for two reasons: safflower has a high capacity for automatic self-fertilization; and bees undertook long foraging bouts in the field, which made between-field pollinations relatively rare. A strategy for minimizing GM gene flow should utilize a conventional safflower variety that has a high capacity for automatic self-fertilization and should allow the conventional plants to grow in large stands to encourage long foraging bouts by bees. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","a mechanistic model of pollinator-mediated gene flow in agricultural safflower","In many species of crop plant, gene flow by cross-pollination"

Movements by bumblebees Bombus lapidarius were studied in arrays of plants of oil-seed rape Brassica napus cv Westar. In the arrays, plants were arranged into either a uniformly dispersed configuration or a patchily dispersed configuration. 2. Progress across an array was measured as the distance bumblebees had moved away from an original plant location after eight subsequent, successive plant visits. Movements were analysed in units of both metres and inter-plant spaces. In both units, bumblebees progressed more slowly across patchily dispersed arrays. 3. Plant dispersion had a detectable effect on certain components of bees' individual inter-plant moves (e.g. move length in metres) but not on others (e.g. mean turning angle). In some cases, the effects of aggregation on the components of individual moves were probably too small to detect statistically and only emerged in their cumulative effect on bees' progress. 4. Over short sequences of plant visits, bumblebees revisited plants rarely, but the frequency of revisits was almost twice as high in patchy arrays as in uniform arrays, and economic penalties may result from foraging among highly aggregated plants. 5. The effects of plant dispersion on pollinator movements detected in this study are unlikely to have a major impact on pollen transfer in B. napus because differences in pollinator progress only emerged after several successive inter-plant flights away from a potential pollen source, by which time the limited extent of pollen carryover in this species means that fertilisations from the source plant would be very rare.","a comparison of bumblebees' movements in uniform and aggregated distributions","1.

However, Manasse found that bee-mediated gene flow was unrelated to the degree of aggregation among the plants in the linear arrays that be studied. To investigate this apparent contradiction further, I manipulated the levels of aggregation in linear plant arrays and examined both the effect of the movements of the bumblebee pollinators and the likely consequences for pollen dispersal and gene flow. I studied pollinator movements among plants of oil-seed rape (Brassica napus ev. Westar) that were arranged in rows that each contained 50 plants. In each experiment one row of plants was spaced at uniform intervals and the remaining rows contained aggregated plant distributions. Experiments were conducted at two scales, short rows (10 ml) and long rows (20 m). The plants were visited almost exclusively by worker caste individuals of Bombus lapidarius. Bumblebees were followed over successive visits within a row and location of each visited plant and the number of flowers probed there was recorded. Within each row, I examined the following components of bumblebee behaviour; the mean number of flowers probed per plant visit; the meant interplant flight distance; and the mean directionality (proportion of moves in an individual's favoured direction). The collective movements of bumblebees within each row were characterised by the rate of change of the bees mean squared distance from an original location. The spatial dispersion of pollen from a paternal plant was estimated in each row by combining a quantitative description of bumblebee movements in terms of displacement from a paternal plant with a model of pollen deposition. Bumblebees were observed to visit many plants successively within a row and movements between rows were infrequent. In both long and short rows, three components of bumblebee movement behaviour were significantly modified by the level of plant aggregation. With increasing plant aggregation, bumblebees exhibited a decrease in directionality and in the number of flowers probed per plant visit and they exhibited an increase in the number of plants by-passed during interplant flights. Despite the effect of plant aggregation on the components of bumblebee behaviour, the bumblebees collective rate of movement away from an origin within a row was unrelated to the level of plant aggregation. This was consistent with the finding that plant aggregation did not significantly affect either the estimates of mean pollen dispersal distances measured in metres or a plant's expected number of female mates. The modifications to bumblebee behaviour that were caused by differential aggregation among rows apparently combined, fortuitously, to buffer the spatial extent of pollen dispersal. Consequently, my results are consistent with heterogeneity at these scales. However, I also conclude that the effects of plant aggregation on gene flow will depend on the spatial scale of the inter-patch distances.","spatial heterogeneity, pollinator behaviour and pollinator-mediated gene flow: bumblebee movements","The foraging movements of bees are said to be influenced"

Theory predicts that the susceptibility of patches of plants to gene flow mediated by incoming pollinators will depend on the length of pollinator residence (the number of flowers visited during a bout in a patch). We sought to determine whether pollinator residence is sufficiently sensitive to patch size and separation to influence levels of gene flow significantly. We studied oilseed rape Brassica napus as an exemplar of a conventional animal-pollinated plant and as a species where there is a risk of genetic escape from genetically modified (GM) varieties. 2. We determined pollinator residence in 36 patches created by mowing an agricultural field of flowering oilseed rape. Each square patch had an edge length of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 m. Patches were separated by either 9 m or 18 m from the border of a large unmown area of crop. We used the residence of bumblebees (Bombus spp.) to solve a model of bumblebee-mediated gene flow. 3. Bumblebee residence increased significantly with patch area, but did not depend on the separation distance of the patch from the large areas of crop. Even in the largest patches, bees visited only c. 60 of the c. 1 × 105 flowers before leaving. 4. If bumblebees were the sole pollinators, the model predicted that 4-8% of the seed produced by the smaller patches (c. 80-320 plants) had fathers outside the patch, whereas in the larger patches (720-8000 plants) the prediction was 2-4%. Nevertheless, larger patches should produce the greatest number of seeds with extrinsic paternity. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our observations demonstrate that susceptibility to pollinator-mediated gene flow is liable to decrease systematically as the size of plant patches increases. These findings can inform the management of genetic diversity in and among small or fragmented populations. If the patch size-gene flow relationship that we observed applies to larger scales, the model could estimate gene flow between GM crops and volunteer or feral populations in agricultural landscapes.","the effect of patch size and separation on bumblebee foraging","1.

Comparisons among animal pollinators of the spatial distributions of pollen that they produce have typically been made among morphologically disparate pairs of species. In contrast, we investigated the potential extent of pollen dispersal by honey-bees (Apis mellifera) and bumble-bees (Bombus lapidarius, B. pascuorum and B. terrestris) foraging in rows of oil-seed rape (Brassica napus cv Westar). 2. We estimated the pollen carryover attributable to individual bees by using particulate fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Most of the dye was deposited at the first few flowers probed and smaller proportions were deposited up to the 20th successively probed flower. We found no significant interspecific differences in dye carryover mediated by individuals of A. mellifera, B. lapidarius and B. terrestris with respect to either the amount deposited or the rate of decline in deposition across successively probed flowers. We present evidence that the dye produced a reasonably good analogue of pollen transfer. 3. Bees typically flew from one plant to another nearby in the same row and were strongly directional in their movements. Bee species differed significantly in their movement patterns, with B. terrestris having the greatest mean move length and directionality. 4. We used three kinds of model (a numerical simulation and two different sets of diffusion-advection equations) to attempt to emulate bee movements. The predictions from all models were reasonably consistent with the observed bee movements, although the numerical simulation invariably made the most accurate predictions, particularly over the first few moves. 5. Predicted bee movements were combined with least-squares models of dye deposition to estimate the spatial dispersal of pollen by each bee species. All models ranked the bees in the same order of decreasing effectiveness in dye dispersal: B. terrestris, A. mellifera, B. lapidarius, B. pascuorum, although, except for long-distance dispersal, there was only minor variation among the bee species in the predicted extents of dye dispersal (e.g. the models predicted that the median dispersal distance would be approximately two intervening plants irrespective of the species of bee). Overall, the consensus of the models' predictions is that most of the pollen from a source plant is deposited on immediate neighbours, but that long-distance pollen dispersal in this system extends over approximately 20-40 intervening plants from the originating plant, depending on the identity of the pollinator.","predicted pollen dispersal by honey-bees and three species of bumble-bees","1.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind-tunnel experiments were used to investigate the aerodynamic interactions between the flower and a windborne suspension of its pollen. 3. The flower's petals handicapped wind pollination by reducing the target efficiency of the upwind-facing stigma. For downwind-facing flowers, pollen reception was negligible. 4. Several aspects of the plant's architecture (floral structure, pollen cohesiveness, inflorescence structure) are uncompromisingly zoophilous. Estimates of the amount of wind pollination suggest that it is unlikely to be important for the long-distance dispersal of B. napus genes such as those from genetically modified varieties. 5.

The model requires specification of three elements: (1) the paternity that originates from a single flower, the paternity shadow; (2) the mean number of flowers that pollinators visit during stays in the sink population, the residence; (3) the proportion of pollinators arriving at the sink that carry pollen from the source population. Provided that pollinators visit enough flowers in the sink to exhaust the paternity shadows from the source, the general results are that gene flow is inversely proportional to the mean pollinator residence in the sink population, and is proportional to the fraction of pollinators arriving with pollen from the source. These results are used to propose explanations for two of the widely observed patterns in gene flow among plant populations. Numerical solutions to the model are derived using experimentally determined values of elements (1) and (2) that represent bumblebees, Bombus spp., visiting agricultural fields of oilseed rape, Brassica napus L. In B. napus, the paternity shadow attenuates rapidly over approximately 20 recipient flowers. Mean bumblebee residences in the fields studied varied between 490 and 720 flowers. In the absence of a direct measurement of element (3), we calculated the maximum level of bumblebee-mediated gene flow by assuming that all bees arrived at the sink saturated with pollen from extrinsic sources. In this case, the model predicts that bumblebee-mediated gene flow accounted for between 0.1% and 0.5% of the progeny in the agricultural fields studied. A likelihood analysis Of Our observations is unable to reveal convincingly the proportion of bees arriving at the sink via a source population, but the literature suggests that bumblebees have high site fidelity, which implies that bee-mediated gene flow may be substantially less than our estimated maximum. We consider the role of various factors, including wind pollination, in accounting for the differences between the model's predictions and the generally higher levels of gene flow observed in previous studies of oilseed rape.","a model of pollinator-mediated gene flow between plant populations with","We present a model that predicts the level of gene"

Investigating the ecology of species with expanding ranges provides a potentially powerful means of elucidating these factors. Such species may also bring novel pollination services to their new ranges. We therefore investigated landscape-scale habitat use and foraging preferences of the Tree Bumblebee, B. hypnorum , a recent natural colonist that has rapidly expanded its range in the UK over the past decade. Counts of B. hypnorum and six other Bombus species were made in March-June 2012 within a mixed landscape in south-eastern Norfolk, UK. The extent of different landscape elements around each transect was quantified at three scales (250 m, 500 m and 1500 m). We then identified the landscape elements that best predicted the density of B. hypnorum and other Bombus species. At the best fitting scale (250 m), B. hypnorum density was significantly positively associated with extent of both urban and woodland cover and significantly negatively associated with extent of oilseed rape cover. This combination of landscape predictors was unique to B. hypnorum. Urban and woodland cover were associated with B. hypnorum density at three and two, respectively, of the three scales studied. Relative to other Bombus species, B. hypnorum exhibited a significantly higher foraging preference for two flowering trees, Crataegus monogyna and Prunus spinosa, and significantly lower preferences for Brassica napus , Glechoma hederacea and Lamium album. Our study provides novel, quantitative support for an association of B. hypnorum with urban and woodland landscape elements. Range expansion in B. hypnorum appears to depend, on exploitation of widespread habitats underutilised by native Bombus species, suggesting B. hypnorum will readily co-exist with these species.

For example, it is widely accepted that desert ants and honey bees, but also mammals, use path integration for finding the way back to their home site. It is however a matter of a long standing debate whether animals in addition are able to acquire and use so called cognitive maps. Such a 'map', a global spatial representation of the foraging area, is generally assumed to allow the animal to find shortcuts between two sites although the direct connection has never been travelled before. Using the artificial neural network approach, here we develop an artificial memory system which is based on path integration and various landmark guidance mechanisms (a bank of individual and independent landmark-defined memory elements). Activation of the individual memory elements depends on a separate motivation network and an, in part, asymmetrical lateral inhibition network. The information concerning the absolute position of the agent is present, but resides in a separate memory that can only be used by the path integration subsystem to control the behaviour, but cannot be used for computational purposes with other memory elements of the system. Thus, in this simulation there is no neural basis of a cognitive map. Nevertheless, an agent controlled by this network is able to accomplish various navigational tasks known from ants and bees and often discussed as being dependent on a cognitive map. For example, map-like behaviour as observed in honey bees arises as an emergent property from a decentralized system. This behaviour thus can be explained without referring to the assumption that a cognitive map, a coherent representation of foraging space, must exist. We hypothesize that the proposed network essentially resides in the mushroom bodies of the insect brain. © 2011 Cruse, Wehner.","no need for a cognitive map: decentralized memory for insect","In many animals the ability to navigate over long distances"

Alternative approaches include heuristic methods that employ iterative optimization procedures for detecting multiple circles. Since only one circle can be marked at each optimization cycle, multiple executions ought to be enforced in order to achieve multi-detection. This paper presents an algorithm for automatic detection of multiple circular shapes that considers the overall process as a multi-modal optimization problem. The approach is based on the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, a swarm optimization algorithm inspired by the intelligent foraging behavior of honeybees. Unlike the original ABC algorithm, the proposed approach presents the addition of a memory for discarded solutions. Such memory allows holding important information regarding other local optima, which might have emerged during the optimization process. The detector uses a combination of three non-collinear edge points as parameters to determine circle candidates. A matching function (nectar-amount) determines if such circle candidates (bee-food sources) are actually present in the image. Guided by the values of such matching functions, the set of encoded candidate circles are evolved through the ABC algorithm so that the best candidate (global optimum) can be fitted into an actual circle within the edge-only image. Then, an analysis of the incorporated memory is executed in order to identify potential local optima, i. e., other circles. The proposed method is able to detect single or multiple circles from a digital image through only one optimization pass. Simulation results over several synthetic and natural images, with a varying range of complexity, validate the efficiency of the proposed technique regarding its accuracy, speed, and robustness. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","multi-circle detection on images using artificial bee colony (abc) optimization","Hough transform has been the most common method for circle"

We address this problem with experiments in almond orchards in south-east Australia, considering impacts on honeybee pollen foraging and fruit set. We examined the effect of distance from colony location on the depletion rate of pollen from flowers near (~40 m) and far (260-490 m) from colonies in almond orchards. We assessed pollen loads of 950 flowers in total, collected at four times of day (9-9:30 h, 11-11:30 h, 13-13:30 h and 15-15:30 h), from 8 near: far pairs. We also surveyed fruit set on nearly 900 trees in replicated transects over two seasons to determine the effect of distance from colony when using large placements of colonies (~120 colonies, N = 581 trees), and effect of colony density when using smaller placements of colonies (N = 313 trees). Flowers near colonies maintained an approximately constant mean pollen load over the course of the day, indicating that the rate of pollen released by flowers was matched by the rate of pollen collection by bees. Flowers far from colonies increased in pollen load over the course of the day, indicating relatively less pollen-collecting activity, so that by 15:30 h they had, on average, 46% more than flowers near colonies. Fruit set declined with distance by 22% over 850 m, consistent with the observation that pollen foraging declines over distance from colony. Fruit set also declined with colony density from 46% at 6·8 colonies per ha to 33% at 2·8 colonies per ha. Synthesis and applications. Pollen-collecting activity is relatively low at flowers far from honeybee colonies, creating a risk of lost yield through underpollination.

It is important to understand the way they move in agricultural landscapes if we are to conserve them and benefit from their activity as pollinators. We surveyed bees using directional flight interception (Malaise) traps over a 1-year period in two agricultural landscapes in south-east Queensland, Australia. We placed traps at the ecotone between crops and remnant vegetation to establish the pattern of movement between these habitats. Species richness in these landscapes (70) was high relative to that in comparable studies. Some bees were active year round, but most were caught in the period September to March. Across the whole assemblage there was a significant pattern where more species were detected leaving rather than entering remnant vegetation. The same bias was true for the number of individuals of the two most abundant species (Homalictus urbanus and Apis mellifera). Species exclusively found in crops were smaller on average (and therefore have smaller foraging range) than their non-crop counterparts. Together, these patterns indicate that while bees are abundant in crop habitat, the remnant vegetation is important as the point of origin for bee movements, and the riparian remnant in particular is richer than the dry native remnant. Compositional similarity among samples was significantly explained by landscape but also movement direction (i.e. to or from the riparian remnant) because different species showed different patterns of response. The landscape with greater native vegetation cover supported more species in and around crops than the landscape with less native vegetation. © 2012 The Authors.

Edges also provide favorable conditions for invasive plants, which may usurp pollinators and reduce visitation to native or crop plants. Alternatively, floral displays of alien plants may facilitate, or increase, the pollination success of adjacent plants by attracting more pollinators to the area. Therefore, pollination services of bees from seminatural habitats to crop areas should vary with the presence of invasive floral resources and distance from habitat edges. To test the hypothesis that floral resources of invasive forest shrubs affect the bee community and pollination services in adjacent crop fields, we conducted a 2-yr field experiment along forest-crop edges at five isolated forest remnants. We removed flower buds from a dominant invasive shrub, Lonicera maackii (Amur honeysuckle), along forest-crop edges and paired removals with controls of intact flowers. The bee community, their pollination services, and flower visitation rates were quantified along a 200-m gradient into an adjacent crop field using pan traps and sentinel cucumber plants. Impacts to the bee community were dependent of bee functional traits. Larger bees visited fewer sentinel cucumber flowers in flower removal plots, which corresponded with decreased cucumber pollination compared to plots with honeysuckle flowers at distances >100 m from forest edges. Small-bodied and weaker flying bees visited sentinel plants more frequently closer to the forest edge and increased pollination services to cucumber at distances L. maackii shrubs in flower removal plots. After 2 yr, bee abundance and species richness increased within flower removal plots across all distances. High functional diversity of the bee community increased pollination services to sentinel plants and increased cucumber production within 200 m from forest remnants. Our findings suggest that dense floral resources of invasive shrubs suppressed forest-edge bee communities and their pollination services, but also attracted large-bodied generalist bees, which were effective pollinators. This study helps explain how life histories and functional attributes of bees can predict either facilitation or suppression of pollination services to crop or native plants in response to invasive floral resources.","bee communities and pollination services in adjacent crop fields following","The habitat boundaries between crops and seminatural areas influence bee"

Since land management affects pollinator numbers, it is also likely to affect the resultant pollination of plants growing in these habitats. We hypothesised that the seed or fruit set of two plant species, typically pollinated by bumblebees and/or honeybees might respond in one of two ways: 1) pollination success could be reduced when growing in a floriferous environment, via competition for pollinators, or 2) pollination success could be enhanced because of increased pollinator abundance in the vicinity. Methodology/Principal Findings: We compared the pollination success of experimental plants of Glechoma hederacea L. and Lotus corniculatus L. growing in gardens and arable farmland. On the farms, the plants were placed either next to a mass-flowering crop (oilseed rape, Brassica napus L. or field beans, Vicia faba L.) or next to a cereal crop (wheat, Triticum spp.). Seed set of G. hederacea and fruit set of L. corniculatus were significantly higher in gardens compared to arable farmland. There was no significant difference in pollination success of G. hederacea when grown next to different crops, but for L. corniculatus, fruit set was higher in the plants growing next to oilseed rape when the crop was in flower. Conclusions/Significance: The results show that pollination services can limit fruit set of wild plants in arable farmland, but there is some evidence that the presence of a flowering crop can facilitate their pollination (depending on species and season). We have also demonstrated that gardens are not only beneficial to pollinators, but also to the process of pollination.","two bee-pollinated plant species show higher seed production when grown","Background: Insect pollinator abundance, in particular that of bees, has"

In this study we examined the diversity and abundance of native bees in lowbush blueberry fields in Nova Scotia, while considering spatial and temporal patterns in their distribution over the growing season. In total, we collected 95 species representing 13 genera, of which Lasioglossum and Andrena comprised >92% of all individuals. The abundance of several of the most common species was inversely related to distance from the forest edge, but was low inside the adjacent forest. In contrast, species diversity was highest inside the forest and consistently low within fields. Larger bees were found further into fields than smaller bees. Whereas some abundant bees were collected most often outside the blueberry bloom period, Lasioglossum cressonii, the most abundant species, was collected often during blueberry bloom, suggesting it could be an effective pollinator in this system.

Colonies were placed in clothianidin seed-treated or control canola fields during bloom, and thereafter were moved to an apiary with no surrounding crops grown from seeds treated with neonicotinoids. Colony weight gain, honey production, pest incidence, bee mortality, number of adults, and amount of sealed brood were assessed in each colony throughout summer and autumn. Samples of honey, beeswax, pollen, and nectar were regularly collected, and samples were analyzed for clothianidin residues. Several of these endpoints were also measured in spring 2013. Overall, colonies were vigorous during and after the exposure period, and we found no effects of exposure to clothianidin seed-treated canola on any endpoint measures. Bees foraged heavily on the test fields during peak bloom and residue analysis indicated that honey bees were exposed to low levels (0.5-2 ppb) of clothianidin in pollen. Low levels of clothianidin were detected in a few pollen samples collected toward the end of the bloom from control hives, illustrating the difficulty of conducting a perfectly controlled field study with free-ranging honey bees in agricultural landscapes. Overwintering success did not differ significantly between treatment and control hives, and was similar to overwintering colony loss rates reported for the winter of 2012-2013 for beekeepers in Ontario and Canada.

The effects of this exposure at plant community level are unknown and difficult to assess in a scientifically appropriate manner. Such an assessment can be scientifically adequate if a studied plant community is completely new and control-impact radiation treatment is used. In this review we aimed to predict ecological effects and identify indicators of the impact of bioactive RF-EMFs at the mobile telephony frequency range on plant communities. We considered the scenario where a plant community was exposed to radiation generated by a base transmitting station antenna mounted on a nearby mast. This plant community can be represented by mesic meadow, ruderal or arable weed community, or other herbaceous, moderately productive vegetation type. We concentrated primarily on radiation effects that can be recorded for a year since the exposure started. To predict them we used physical theories of radiowave propagation in vegetation and the knowledge on plants physiological responses to RF-EMF. Our indicators can be used for the detection of the impact of RF-EMFs on vegetation in a control-impact experiment. The identified indicators can be classified into the following groups: (1) canopy parameters; (2) plant characteristics to be measured in the field or laboratory in a number of individuals that represent the populations of selected species; (3) community weighted means/medians (CWMs) of plant traits and strategies; (4) the abundance of other organisms that interact with plants and can influence their fitness or population size. The group of canopy parameters includes mean height, vertical vegetation structure and dry weight of above-ground standing phytomass. Plant characteristics requiring biometric sampling in the field are plant height, the number of fruits and seeds, as well as seed viability. The group of plant traits that are calculated as CWMs covers seed releasing height, seed dispersal mode, SLA, leaf orientation, month of germination and flowering, Ellenberg's light indicator value, and the proportion of individuals in the classes of competitors and stress tolerators according to Grime's CSR strategy scheme. The group of “non-plant” indicators includes primarily the frequency of flower visits by beetles, wasps, hoverflies, and bees that have their nests over ground. To detect ecological responses that occur for the first year since a herbaceous community has been exposed to potentially bioactive RF-EMF, the first two indicators groups should be used. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","the influence of bioactive mobile telephony radiation at the level","Environmental exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) from mobile telephony"

In the pollen sink area four plots with 30 trees each, located at 25, 200, 400 and 550. m from the PD were established as sink islands. Before flowering, the entire clonal stands of clones PS1 and PS2, with exception of the sink islands were clear cut. Seeds were harvested from five randomly sampled trees in each sink island and the paternity of 15 seedlings per tree, 75 seedlings per island totaling a sample of 300 seedlings, was determined with PD as the alleged father. The self-pollination rate in the sink islands varied from zero to 24%. Paternity assignment to the PD was highest in the island at 25. m (17.3%) and rapidly decreased to 4.0% at 200. m and 2.7% at 550. m, suggesting a pattern of isolation by distance, while revealing a large pollen contribution from unaccounted sources across all islands. Our results in a fragmented clonal site agree with previous estimates of general pollen movement in eucalypt seed orchards, showing that pollination will take place by and large at relatively short distances of less than 200. m, consistent with the expected range of flight of pollinator bees. Nevertheless the exponential distribution observed also indicates that low levels of pollination success are to be expected over longer distances. Our data provide useful guidelines regarding the distance at which seed orchards should be established away from potentially large pollen pressure of clonal stands to minimize unwanted pollen introgression.

Focusing on the Mediterranean basin, we review the literature and propose conceptual models to explain the direct and indirect effects of fire on plant-pollinator interactions, seed dispersers, and predators, as well as the temporal changes in these systems along post-fire succession and ecosystem recovery processes. Post-fire plant communities change in their composition, structure, floral resources, as well as seed and fruit resources. Fire directly affects communities of pollinators, seed dispersers, and seed predators mainly by mortality, and indirectly through changes in the quality and quantity of food and nesting resources. Pollinators, seed-dispersers, and seed predators depend on plant community composition and on the flower, seed, and fruit resources they produce. As a consequence, their community composition, structure, and function are expected to vary in response to post-fire temporal and spatial changes in plant communities, which in turn depend on fire severity, frequency, scale, and the distance from fire-edge, as well as their foraging range. In return, the changes resulting from fire in pollinator, seed-disperser and seed predator communities may affect plant fecundity and plant community composition.","the effect of fire on biotic interactions in mediterranean basin","Mediterranean type ecosystems are among the world's most fire-prone regions."

Very early after its commercial introduction, it was recognized that this species is invasive, can island hop to new locations and may disturb local ecosystems. The invasive characteristics of B. terrestris are: high migration ability, early seasonal emergence, high adaptability under adverse climatic conditions in various habitats, generalist or polylectic foraging strategies, enabling it to work a wide variety of flowers for resources, foraging over wide distances, a thermoregulatory metabolism that enables it to withstand low temperatures, no natural enemies to check population growth in areas outside its natural range, and it may develop two reproductive cycles in a year (bivoltine) in a newly colonized area. In addition, commercial bees produce more gynes and are better competitors than the local conspecific populations and may replace them in the likely event of an escape. The documented evidence on invasive impact of B. terrestris on natural ecosystems includes: negative interactions with local bee fauna, competition for nest sites with, and genetic contamination of, local Bombus spp., spread of parasites and pathogens and negative interactions with plant reproductive capacity.

Decades of research have revealed that flying insects control speed, altitude, and trajectory by a simple strategy of maintaining or balancing the translational velocity of images on the eyes, known as pattern velocity. It has been proposed that birds may use a similar algorithm but this hypothesis has not been tested directly. We examined the influence of pattern velocity on avian flight by manipulating the motion of patterns on the walls of a tunnel traversed by Anna's hummingbirds. Contrary to prediction, we found that lateral course control is not based on regulating nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity. Instead, birds closely monitored feature height in the vertical axis, and steered away from taller features even in the absence of nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity cues. For vertical course control, we observed that birds adjusted their flight altitude in response to upward motion of the horizontal plane, which simulates vertical descent. Collectively, our results suggest that birds avoid collisions using visual cues in the vertical axis. Specifically, we propose that birds monitor the vertical extent of features in the lateral visual field to assess distances to the side, and vertical pattern velocity to avoid collisions with the ground. These distinct strategies may derive from greater need to avoid collisions in birds, compared with small insects.","visual guidance of forward flight in hummingbirds reveals control based","Information about self-motion and obstacles in the environment is encoded"

Colonies of the two stocks were managed equally in Louisiana during autumn through early spring preceding observations in late spring each year. Resulting average populations of adult bees and of brood were similar in colonies of the two bee stocks during pollination. Flight during pollination was monitored hourly on 6 d each year by counting bees exiting each colony per minute; counts were made manually with flight cones on 17 colonies per stock in 2003 and electronically with ApiSCAN-Plus counters on 20 colonies per stock in 2004. Analysis of variance showed that temperature, colony size (population of adult bees or brood), and the interaction of these effects were the strongest regulators of flight activity in both years. Russian and Italian bees had similar flight activity at any given colony size, temperature, or time of day. Flight increased linearly with rising temperatures and larger colony sizes. Larger colonies, however, were more responsive than smaller colonies across the range of temperatures measured. In 2003, flight responses to varying temperatures were less in the afternoon and evening (1500-1959 hours) than they were earlier in the day.

Systemic insecticides are recognized as one of the drivers of worldwide honey and wild bee declines. Particularly honey bees in agricultural environments are exposed to pesticides when they collect crop pollen and nectar. However, landscape scale studies which analyze pollen use and foraging distances of honey bees on mass-flowering crops like maize to evaluate potential exposure risks are currently lacking. In an experimental approach on a landscape scale we took advantage of intra-colonial dance communication to gather information about the location of utilized pollen resources. During maize flowering, four observation hives were placed in and rotated between 11 different landscapes which covered a gradient from low to high maize acreage. A higher frequency of dances for foraging locations on maize fields compared to other land use types shows that maize is an intensively used pollen resource for honey bee colonies. Mean foraging distances were significantly shorter for maize pollen than for other pollen origins. The percentage of maize pollen foragers did not increase with maize acreage in the landscape. The proportion of grassland area providing alternative pollen sources did not reduce the percentage of maize pollen foragers. Our findings allow estimating the distance-related exposure risk of honey bee colonies to pollen from surrounding maize fields treated with systemic insecticides. Similarly, the results can be used to estimate the exposure to transgenic maize pollen, which is relevant for honey production in European countries. Provision of alternative pollen resources within agri-environmental schemes could potentially reduce exposure risk to pesticide contaminated crop pollen. © 2014 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","maize pollen foraging by honey bees in relation to crop","The increasing demand for insect pollinated crops and high recent"

In a field experiment, we rotated 16 honey bee colonies across 16 agricultural landscapes, used traps to collect samples of collected pollen and observed intra-colonial dance communication to gain information about foraging distances. DNA metabarcoding was applied to analyze mixed pollen samples. Neither the amount of collected pollen nor pollen diversity was related to landscape diversity. However, we found a strong seasonal variation in the amount and diversity of collected pollen in all sites independent of landscape diversity. The observed increase in foraging distances with decreasing landscape diversity suggests that honey bees compensated for lower landscape diversity by increasing their pollen foraging range in order to maintain pollen amount and diversity.

However, it is unknown how increasing areas of mass-flowering crops like oilseed rape (Brassica napus; OSR) or a decrease of seminatural habitats (SNH) change the temporal and spatial availability of pollen resources for honey bee colonies, and thus foraging distances and firequency in different habitat types. We studied pollen foraging of honey bee colonies in 16 agricultural landscapes with independent gradients of OSR and SNH area within 2 km and used waggle dances and digital geographic maps with major land cover types to reveal the distance and visited habitat type on a landscape level. Mean pollen foraging distance of 1347 decoded bee dances was 1015 m (± 26 m; SEM). In spring, increasing area of flowering OSR within 2 km reduced mean pollen foraging distances from 1324 m to only 435 m. In summer, increasing cover of SNH areas close to the colonies (within 200 m radius) reduced mean pollen foraging distances from 846 to 469 m. Frequency of pollen foragers per habitat type, measured as the number of dances per hour and hectare, was equally high for SNH, grassland, and OSR fields, but lower for other crops and forests. In landscapes with a small proportion of SNH a significantly higher density of pollen foragers on SNH was observed, indicating that pollen resources in such simple agricultural landscapes are more limited. Overall, we conclude that SNH and mass-fowering crops can reduce foraging distances of honey bee colonies at different scales and seasons with possible benefits for the performance of honey bee colonies. Further, mixed agricultural landscapes with a high proportion of SNH reduce foraging densities of honey bees in SNH and thus possible competition for pollen resources. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","season and landscape composition affect pollen foraging distances and habitat","Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) show a large variation in"

Strategies for their conservation require knowledge of their foraging range and nesting density, both of which are poorly understood. Previous studies have mainly focussed on the cosmopolitan bumblebee species Bombus terrestris, and implicitly assume this to be representative of other species. Here we use a landscape-scale microsatellite study to estimate the foraging range and nesting density of two ecologically dissimilar species, B. terrestris and B. pascuorum. Workers were sampled along a 10 km linear transect and 8-9 polymorphic microsatellite markers used to identify putative sisters. We provide the first published estimates of the number of colonies using a circle of radius 50 m in an agricultural landscape: 20.4 for B. terrestris and 54.7 for B. pascuorum. Estimates of nest density differed significantly between the two species: 13 km-2 for B. terrestris and 193 km-2 for B. pascuorum. Foraging ranges also differed substantially, with B. pascuorum foraging over distances less than 312 m and B. terrestris less than 625 m. Clearly bumblebee species differ greatly in fundamental aspects of their ecology. This has significant implications for the development of conservation strategies for rare bumblebees and isolated plant populations, for the management of bumblebees as pollinators, and for predicting patterns of gene flow from genetically modified plants.","use of genetic markers to quantify bumblebee foraging range and","Bumblebees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) are important pollinators of crops and wildflowers,"

Populations of both species showed significant structuring, and isolation by distance, but this was markedly greater in B. muscorum (θ = 0.13) than in B. jonellus (θ = 0.034). This difference could reflect a higher effective population size in B. jonellus compared to B. muscorum, but this is not consistent with the observed abundance of the two species.

Bee colonies exemplify a high level of intrinsic interdependence and co-ordination among its members, and algorithms inspired from the bee colonies have gained recent prominence in the field of swarm based metaheuristics. The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm was recently developed, by simulating the minimalistic foraging model of honeybees in search of food sources, for solving real-parameter, non-convex, and non-smooth optimization problems. The single parameter perturbation in classical ABC resulted in fairly commendable performance for simple problems without epistasis of variables (separable). However, it suffered from narrow search zone and slow convergence which eventually led to poor exploitation tendency. Even with the increase in dimensionality, a significant deterioration was observed in the ability of ABC to locate the optimum in a huge search volume. Some of the probable shortcomings in the basic ABC approach, as observed, are the single parameter perturbation instead of a multiple one, ignoring the fitness to reward ratio while selecting food sites, and most importantly the absence of environmental factors in the algorithm design. Research has shown that spatial environmental factors play a crucial role in insect locomotion and foragers seem to learn the direction to be undertaken based on the relative analysis of its proximal surroundings. Most importantly, the mapping of the forager locomotion from three dimensional search spaces to a multidimensional solution space calls forth the implementation of multiple modification schemes. Based on the fundamental observation pertaining to the dynamics of ABC, this article proposes an improved variant of ABC aimed at improving the optimizing ability of the algorithm over an extended set of problems. The hybridization of the proposed fitness learning mechanism with a weighted selection scheme and proximity based stimuli helps to achieve a fine blending of explorative and exploitative behaviour by enhancing both local and global searching ability of the algorithm. This enhances the ability of the swarm agents to detect optimal regions in the unexplored fitness basins. With respect to its immediate surroundings, a proximity based component is added to the normal positional modification of the onlookers and is enacted through an improved probability selection scheme that takes the T/E (total reward to distance) ratio metric into account. The biologically-motivated, hybridized variant of ABC achieves a statistically superior performance on majority of the tested benchmark instances, as compared to some of the most prominent state-of-the-art algorithms, as is demonstrated through a detailed experimental evaluation and verified statistically. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigate the population structure of Colletes floralis, a rare and threatened solitary mining bee, in Ireland and Scotland using nine microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was surprisingly as high in Scottish (Hebridean island) populations at the extreme northwestern edge of the species range as in mainland Irish populations further south. Extremely high genetic differentiation among populations was detected; multilocus FST was up to 0.53, and and Dest were even higher (maximum: 0.85 and 1.00, respectively). A pattern of isolation by distance was evident for sites separated by land. Water appears to act as a substantial barrier to gene flow yet sites separated by sea did not exhibit isolation by distance.

It conveys to bees and human observers the position of a relatively small area at the endpoint of an average vector in a two-dimensional system of coordinates. This vector is often computed from a collection of waggle phases from the same or different dancers. The question remains, however, of how informative a small sample of waggle phases can be to the bees, and how the spatial information encoded in the dance is actually mapped to the followers' searches in the field. Certainly, it is the variability of a dancer's performance that initially defines the level of uncertainty that followers must cope with if they were to successfully decode information in the dance. Understanding how a dancer's behaviour is mapped to that of its followers initially relies on the analysis of both the accuracy and precision with which the dancer encodes spatial information in the dance. Here we describe within-individual variations in the encoding of the distance to and direction of a goal. We show that variations in the number of a dancer's wagging movements, a measure that correlates well with the distance to the goal, do not depend upon the dancer's travelled distance, meaning that there is a constant variance of wagging movements around the mean. We also show that the duration of the waggle phases and the angular dispersion and divergence of successive waggle phases co-vary with a dancer's orientation in space. Finally, using data from dances recorded through high-speed video techniques, we present the first analysis of the accuracy and precision with which an increasing number of waggle phases conveys spatial information to a human observer.","variability in the encoding of spatial information by dancing bees","A honeybee's waggle dance is an intriguing example of multisensory"

We collated occurrence and abundance data for 257 bee species at 1584 European sites from surveys reported in 30 published papers (70 056 records) and combined them with species-level ecological trait data. We used mixed-effects models to assess the importance of land use (land-use class, agricultural use-intensity and a remotely-sensed measure of vegetation), traits and trait × land-use interactions, in explaining species occurrence and abundance. Species' sensitivity to land use was most strongly influenced by flight season duration and foraging range, but also by niche breadth, reproductive strategy and phenology, with effects that differed among cropland, pastoral and urban habitats.

Rather than targeting particular species or settings, conservation actions may be more effective if focused on mitigating situations where species' traits strongly and negatively interact with land-use pressures.

Just as exploratory orientation flights of young honeybees, re-orientation flights can be classified into short- and long-range flights, and most short-range re-orientation flights were performed under unfavorable weather conditions. This indicates that bees adapt the flight pattern of their re-orientation and orientation flights to changing weather conditions in a similar way. Unlike exploratory orientation flights, more than one sector of the landscape was explored during a long-range re-orientation flight, and significantly longer flight durations and flight distances were observed. Thus, re-orienting bees explored a larger terrain than bees performing their first exploratory orientation flight. By displacing some bees after their first re-orientation flight, we could demonstrate that a single re-orientation flight seems to be sufficient to learn the new location of the hive. The flight patterns of re-orientation flights differed clearly from those of foraging flights. Thus, re-orientation flights represent a special exploratory behavior that is triggered by a change in the location of the hive. © 2018 Degen et al.

HG applications in colonies started from splits in April reduced mite populations to 0.12 mites per 100 bees. In September, the treated colonies had significantly fewer mites than the untreated controls. Subsequent HG applications in September that lasted for 3 weeks reduced mite populations to levels in November that were significantly lower than in colonies that were untreated or had an HG treatment that lasted for 1 week.

Honey bee colonies also have a yearly life cycle that might generate nutritional requirements that differ between times of brood rearing and colony expansion in the spring and population contraction and preparation for overwintering in the fall. To test this, we analyzed polyfioral mixes of spring and fall pollens to determine if the nutrient composition differed with season. Next, we fed both types of seasonal pollens to bees reared in spring and fall. We compared the development of brood food glands (i.e., hypopharyngeal glands - HPG), and the expression of genes in the fat body between bees fed pollen from the same (in-season) or different season (out-of-season) when they were reared. Because pathogen challenges often heighten the effects of nutritional stress, we infected a subset of bees with Nosema to determine if bees responded differently to the infection depending on the seasonal pollen they consumed. We found that spring and fall pollens were similar in total protein and lipid concentrations, but spring pollens had higher concentrations of amino and fatty acids that support HPG growth and brood production. Bees responded differently when fed in vs. out of season pollen. The HPG of both uninfected and Nosema-infected spring bees were larger when they were fed spring (in-season) compared to fall pollen. Spring bees differentially regulated more than 200 genes when fed in- vs. out-of-season pollen. When infected with Nosema, approximately 400 genes showed different infection-induced expression patterns in spring bees depending on pollen type. In contrast, HPG size in fall bees was not affected by pollen type, though HPG were smaller in those infected with Nosema. Very few genes were differentially expressed with pollen type in uninfected (4 genes) and infected fall bees (5 genes). Pollen type did not affect patterns of infection-induced expression in fall bees. Our data suggest that physiological responses to seasonal pollens differ between bees reared in the spring and fall with spring bees being significantly more sensitive to pollen type especially when infected with Nosema. This study provides evidence that seasonal pollens may provide levels of nutrients that align with the activities of honey bees during their yearly colony cycle. The findings are important for the planning and establishment of forage plantings to sustain honey bees, and in the development of seasonal nutritional supplements fed to colonies when pollen is unavailable.","connecting the nutrient composition of seasonal pollens with changing nutritional","Free-ranging herbivores have yearly life cycles that generate dynamic resource"

However, ecological factors also have the potential to influence demographic history and thus patterns of genetic variation. In this study, we investigated the impact of past climate, and also the potential impact of host plant species abundance, on intraspecific genetic variation in three codistributed and related specialized solitary bees of the genus Melitta with very similar life history traits and dispersal capacities. We sequenced five independent loci in samples collected from the three species. Our analyses revealed that the species associated with the most abundant host plant species (Melitta leporina) displays unusually high genetic variation, to an extent that is seldom reported in phylogeographic studies of animals and plants. This suggests a potential role of food resource abundance in determining current patterns of genetic variation in specialized herbivorous insects. Patterns of genetic variation in the two other species indicated lower overall levels of diversity, and that M. nigricans could have experienced a recent range expansion. Ecological niche modelling of the three Melitta species and their main host plant species suggested a strong reduction in range size during the last glacial maximum. Comparing observed sequence data with data simulated using spatially explicit models of coalescence suggests that M. leporina recovered a range and population size close to their current levels at the end of the last glaciation, and confirms recent range expansion as the most likely scenario for M. nigricans. Overall, this study illustrates that both demographic history and ecological factors may have contributed to shape current phylogeographic patterns. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","impact of past climatic changes and resource availability on the","Past climate change is known to have strongly impacted current"

We then simulated the evolution of DNA sequences under a spatially explicit model of coalescence to compare different hypotheses regarding the mode of colonization associated with this rapid expansion and to identify those that are most consistent with the observed molecular data. Our genetic analyses indicate that the range expansion was not associated with an important reduction in genetic diversity, even in the most recently colonized area in the United Kingdom. Moreover, little genetic differentiation was observed among populations. Our comparative analysis of simulated data sets indicates that the observed genetic data are more consistent with a demographic scenario involving relatively high migration rates than with a scenario based on a high reproduction rate associated with few migrants.

Bees are exposed to these insecticides in pollen and nectar while providing pollination services to agricultural crops, and neonicotinoids have been shown to impair navigation and decrease their foraging activity. We have previously reported the effect of dietary thiamethoxam on sucrose responsiveness of young worker bees. Here, we exposed caged foragers to sublethal acute doses of clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, then tested them individually for sucrose responsiveness using standard methods. In addition, we tested the response to a range of sucrose solutions laced with neonicotinoids on bees previously unexposed to neonicotinoids. This paradigm mimics the situation where foragers would first encounter poisoned nectars varying in sugar concentration. Bees were exposed to the insecticides in the feeding solution for 24 h before testing, or in the test solutions, or both. The three compounds had a detrimental effect on responses to mid-to-high sucrose concentrations under all experimental conditions, and unexposed bees tested with laced sucrose displayed unexpected low responses to the higher sucrose concentrations tested.

Field margins are common linear structures in the agricultural landscape. In the present study, we evaluated the factors that exert an impact on the forage flora composition and on the diversity in field margins. The study was conducted in the 2010 - 2011 time period across the agricultural landscape on the Lublin Upland of SE Poland. Data on the forage flora were obtained while making floristic charts along 45 transect plots x 300 m; the total length being 13500 m. Multivariate ordination techniques (PCA and RDA) were employed to analyse forage-flora characteristics. Field margins represent valuable refuge areas for forage-species richness, but not for the abundance of forage species. On field margins, forage-species diversity benefits from the location of natural habitats (forests or meadows), primarily if the distance from these habitats is <1000 m or the field acreage is <10 ha. The shift from heterogeneous habitats to a more homogeneous landscape causes a reduction of forage floral diversity. Due to lack of dense forage-species patches, the promotion of sowing nectariferous and/or polleniferous species seems to be a reasonable management method to enhance the quantitative food niche on field margins and to support the conservation of pollinators in the areas surrounding farms. © 2015, J.

We analysed the occurrence of insects from 46 different families on flowers of different morphologies, using landscape indices in buffer areas from a 100-m to a 4000-m radius around 1194 sampled sites. Our aims were to determine (i) how the proportion of impervious area around sampled sites affected the occurrence of flower-feeding insect families and at which landscape scales impervious area calculations best predicted these occurrences; (ii) the effect of corolla shape variables on insect family occurrences. Twenty-one families were negatively impacted by increasing proportion of impervious areas (urbanophobic) and 3 were positively impacted (urbanophilic). Urbanophobic families were most affected by the proportion of impervious areas when it was estimated within buffers of 200-m to 1400-m radii, depending on the family. Notable losses of urbanophobic families were detected at less than 50% of impervious areas, which highlights the threat to the diversity of flower-feeding insects posed by urban sprawl. Corolla shape variables were the variables most often significantly implicated in the occurrence of insect families. Urbanophobic families were negatively affected by the tubular shape of flowers, and tubular corollas were found more often in urbanized areas. These results suggest that flora management might be a key component for the conservation of insect diversity in cities.","floral morphology as the main driver of flower-feeding insect occurrences","Through the rapid expansion worldwide of impervious areas and habitat"

Here we characterise the sensitivity, feeding response curve and food intake efficiency of the aphid tending ant, Lasius niger for major sugars found in nectar, honeydew and insect haemolymph (i.e. fructose, glucose, sucrose, melezitose and trehalose). We found that sucrose concentrations - ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 M - triggered food acceptance by L niger workers with their food intake efficiency being enhanced by sugar concentrations of 1 M or higher at which points energy intake was maximised. The range of sucrose concentrations that elicit a feeding response by L niger scouts thus overlaps with that of natural sugar resources. The response curves of feeding acceptance by scouts consistently increased with sugar concentration, except for trehalose which was disregarded by the ants. Ants are highly sensitive to sucrose and melezitose exhibiting low response thresholds. Sucrose, fructose and glucose share a same potential to act as phagostimulants as they had similar half feeding efficiency concentration values when expressed as the energetic content of sugar solution. Aphid-biosynthezised melezitose generated the highest sensitivity and phagostimulant potential. The feeding behavior of ants appears to be primarily regulated by the energy content of the food solution for the main sugars present in nectar and honeydew. However, feeding by scouts is also influenced by the informative value of individual sugars when it serves as a cue for the presence of aphid partners such as the aphid-biosynthesised melezitose.

Spatial patterns of foraging trails tended to maximise acquisition of food resources, as trails led the ants to areas where seeds were more abundant locally, Moreover, harvesting activity concentrated an highly frequented trails, on which seeds were brought into the nest in larger numbers and more efficiently, at a higher mean rate per worker. The predictions of optimal foraging theory that ants should be more selective in both more resource-rich and more distant patches were tested in the native seed background. We confirm that selectivity of ants is positively related to trail length and thus to distance from the nest of foraged seeds. Conversely, we fail to find a consistent relationship between selectivity and density or species diversity of seed patches. We discuss how selectivity assessed at the colony level may depend on factors other than hitherto reported behavioural changes in seed choice by individual foragers.","a field assessment of optimal foraging in ants: trail patterns","The ant Messor barbarus is a major seed predator on"

Values for the Simpson diversity index ranged between 0.764 and 0.964, and for Fager's evenness index between 0.00 and 0.036 for neighbourhoods within populations. This myrmecophyte was found to combine sexual recruitment (66.7%) and clonal production (33.3%) as methods of reproduction. Moderate amounts of genetic diversity at the species level were observed, with 52.63% polymorphism, and moderate values of Shannon's diversity index (0.1895) as well as of Nei's gene diversity (0.1186). In each population, observed genotypic diversity was significantly lower than expected, indicating significant genetic structure. Neighbour-joining trees demonstrated that Agumbe, which is the most northern population examined and geographically twice as far away from the other two populations, grouped separately and with larger bootstrap support from a larger cluster consisting of the Sampaji and Solaikolli populations, which are closer to each other geographically. Some neighbourhoods within each population showed spatial genetic structure even at small spatial scales of <5 m. A combination of clonality and short-distance pollen movement by small pollinating bees (Braunsapis puangensis) coupled with primary ballistic seed dispersal, and possible secondary seed dispersal by rodents, may contribute to spatial genetic structure at such small scales.

The flowering phenology of a plant genotype determines its expected daily floral display which, together with pollinator behavior, governs the population rate of geitonogamous selfing (fertilization among flowers on the same plant). Pollinators select plant phenologies in two ways: they are more likely to visit plants displaying more flowers per day, and they influence geitonogamous selfing and consequent inbreeding depression via their abundance, foraging behavior, and pollen carry-over among flowers on a plant. Our model predicts two types of equilibria at stable intermediate selfing rates for a wide range of pollinator behaviors and pollen transfer parameters. Edge equilibria occur at maximal or minimal selfing rates and are constrained by pollinators. Internal equilibria occur between edge equilibria and are determined by a trade-off between pollinator attraction to large floral displays and avoidance of inbreeding depression due to selfing. We conclude that unavoidable geitonogamous selfing generated by pollinator behavior can contribute to the common occurrence of stable mixed mating in plants.","pollination ecology and inbreeding depression control individual flowering phenologies and","We analyze evolution of individual flowering phenologies by combining an"

Most of the bees studied so far are temperate or tropical species but many ecosystems are predicted to experience increased aridification under climate change. Therefore, we need to understand how pollinator species are likely to respond. Here we present species distribution models for the arid-adapted Australian small carpenter bee, Ceratina australensis Perkins, 1912 (Apidae: Xylocopinae) under Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change conditions predicted for 2070 (Representative Carbon Pathway 8.5). We applied Maximum Entropy, Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models and Random Forest methods. Overall, our models predict that this bee will have an increased area of suitable habitat as climate change progresses, including an increased range within protected areas. However, its potential range will shift further into coastal areas, that are highly human populated and urbanised. Our results suggest that wild bee taxa may be able to cope with the predicted scale of future aridification under climate change. Finally, this species is predicted to increase in urban environments, which highlights the need for city planning, suitable habitats and green spaces to support wild bee species. © 2019 The Authors","range expansion of an already widespread bee under climate change","Climate change is a key threat to pollination networks and"

However, it is not known at present why learning walks take the stereotypical shapes they do. Here we investigate how learning-walk form, visual surroundings and the interaction between the two affect homing performance in a range of virtual worlds when using a simple view-based homing algorithm. We show that the ideal form for a learning walk is environment-specific. We also demonstrate that the distant panorama and small objects at an intermediate distance, particularly when the panorama is obscured, are important aspects of the visual environment both when determining the ideal learning walk and when using stored views to navigate.

The risk of exposure to fungicide residues is likely to be especially high if the spray occurs on, or near host plants while the bees are collecting pollen to provision their nests. For species of Osmia that consume pollen from a select group of plants (oligolecty), the inability to use pollen from non-host plants can increase their risk factor for fungicide-related toxicity. This manuscript describes protocols used to successfully rear oligolectic mason bees, Osmia ribifloris sensu lato, from egg to prepupal stage within cell culture plates under standardized laboratory conditions. The in vitro-reared bees are subsequently used to investigate the effects of fungicide exposure and pollen source on bee fitness. Based on a 2 x 2 fully crossed factorial design, the experiment examines the main and interactive effects of fungicide exposure and pollen source on larval fitness, quantified by prepupal biomass, larval developmental time, and survivorship. A major advantage of this technique is that using in vitro-reared bees reduces natural background variability and allows the simultaneous manipulation of multiple experimental parameters. The described protocol presents a versatile tool for hypotheses testing involving the suite of factors affecting bee health. For conservation efforts to be met with significant, lasting success, such insights into the complex interplay of physiological and environmental factors driving bee declines will prove to be critical.","in vitro rearing of solitary bees: a tool for assessing","Although solitary bees provide crucial pollination services for wild and"

The local abundance of bumblebee species was studied in 22 semi-natural meadows located in Northeast Estonia. The proportion of forest cover and brushwood cover, the mean patch area of forest and the edge density of forest were calculated at four spatial scales (i.e., radii of 250 m, 500 m, 1000 m and 2000 m). In total, we found 597 individuals of bumblebees belonging to 24 species (gen. Bombus), including five species of cuckoo bumblebees (subgen. Psithyrus). Our study shows that some bumblebee species seem to have different preferences in terms of the structure of the landscape. Some species may benefit from a heterogeneous landscape with a high proportion of forest habitats (e.g., B. schrencki), whereas others seem to prefer open areas (e.g., B. veteranus). We also found that some bumblebee species that have large foraging distances (e.g., B. terrestris) seem to be negatively affected by forest, as the presence of a high quantity of forest patches in the surrounding landscape could narrow their foraging area. The joint effects of the set of landscape variables related with forests appear to be important for some bumblebee species, specially, but not only, at the largest spatial scale. Overall, our results indicate that the presence of forest is very important for bumblebees, even for some species that prefer open areas, as forest habitats and edges may offer overwintering sites and nesting places for them. In countries like Estonia, where forests are widely distributed and represent a relevant part of the landscape mosaic, this type of habitat should be preserved if conservation of biodiversity is desired. In addition, conservation efforts targeting particular species of bumblebees should consider the landscape preferences of the species under study, and these efforts should aim to maintain the habitat types that are suitable for most bumblebee species.","effects of forest habitats on the local abundance of bumblebee","The main objective of our study was to analyse how"

In samples from four Maine sites, floral density in Amelanchier nantucketensis was 30.3% greater than that for Amelanchier humilis and 39.5% greater than that for Amelanchier stolonifera; in Amelanchier nantucketensis, flowers were more numerous per cubic metre and distance between flowers was shorter.

Previous studies of the Amazonian tree Dinizia excelsa (Fabaceae) found African honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata) as the predominant pollinators of trees in highly disturbed habitats, transporting pollen up to 3.2 km between pasture trees. Here, using microsatellite genotypes of seed arrays, we compare outcrossing rates and pollen dispersal distances of (i) remnant D. excelsa in three large ranches, and (ii) a population in undisturbed forest in which African honeybees were absent. Self-fertilization was more frequent in the disturbed habitats (14%, n = 277 seeds from 12 mothers) than in undisturbed forest (10%, n = 295 seeds from 13 mothers). Pollen dispersal was extensive in all three ranches compared to undisturbed forest, however. Using a TWOGENER analysis, we estimated a mean pollen dispersal distance of 1509 m in Colosso ranch, assuming an exponential dispersal function, and 212 m in undisturbed forest. The low effective density of D. excelsa in undisturbed forest (∼0.1 trees/ha) indicates that large areas of rainforest must be preserved to maintain minimum viable populations. Our results also suggest, however, that in highly disturbed habitats Apis mellifera may expand genetic neighbourhood areas, thereby linking fragmented and continuous forest populations.","pollen dispersal of tropical trees (dinizia excelsa: fabaceae) by native","Tropical rainforest trees typically occur in low population densities and"

The mtDNA divergences within species were consistently low; across the 12 monophyletic species the mean intraspecific divergence among haplotypes was 0.9% (range of means, 0-1.9%). The cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) divergence among populations separated by the Andes (N = 11 species) averaged 1.1% (range 0.0-2.0%). The mtDNA CO1 data set displayed homogeneous rates of nucleotide substitution, permitting us to infer dispersal across the cordillera long after the final Andean uplift based on arthropod molecular clocks of 1.2-1.5% divergence per million years. Gene flow across the 3000-km breadth of the Amazon basin was inferred from identical cross-Amazon haplotypes found in five species. Although mtDNA haplotypes for 12 of the 14 euglossine species were monophyletic, a reticulate COl phylogeny was recovered in Euglossa cognata and E. mixta, suggesting large ancestral populations and recent speciation. Reference to closely related outgroups suggested recent speciation for the majority of species. Phylogeographical structure across a broad spatial scale is weaker in euglossine bees than in any neotropical group previously examined, and may derive from a combination of Quaternary speciation, population expansion and/or long-distance gene flow.","long-distance gene flow and cross-andean dispersal of lowland rainforest bees","Euglossine bees (Apidae; Euglossini) exclusively pollinate hundreds of orchid species"

Regarding oilseed rape, the most common biofuel crop in the EU, positive responses of flower-visiting insects to plentiful nectar and pollen seem apparent. However, previous investigations on this insect guild revealed conflicting results, potentially because they focused on different taxonomic groups representing a narrow range of ecological traits and considered only short time periods. Here, using trap nests in landscapes with independent gradients in area of oilseed rape and seminatural habitats, we assessed the whole community of cavity-nesting bees and wasps, including early- and late-emerging species. Our study's temporal resolution allowed determination of flowering and postflowering effects of oilseed rape on these species' richness, abundance, and mortality. Species richness of cavity-nesting bees and wasps significantly increased with oilseed rape, although nesting activity was considerably higher after mass flowering. In addition to increasing richness independently of oilseed rape, the amount of seminatural habitat in the landscape was the sole positive driver of insect abundance once the community's dominant species was accounted for as a covariate. Thus, growth of the co-occurring species' community is not stimulated by the resource pulse provided by oilseed rape early in the year, but by persistent resources provided by seminatural habitats after mass flowering. Early individuals of bivoltine species' first generations accumulated in seminatural habitats when these habitats were scarce, but became increasingly diluted when habitat availability increased. Once established, later foraging females generally benefited from the resource availability of seminatural habitats when initializing the second generation. We conclude that mass-flowering crops, despite covering only a short interval of the community's main activity phase, benefit bee and wasp species richness. However, seminatural habitats are crucial in maintaining viable communities of flower-visiting insects at the landscape scale, mitigating potential negative effects of high land-use intensities in modern agro-ecosystems. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","mass-flowering crops increase richness of cavity-nesting bees and wasps in","Considerable uncertainties exist on how increased biofuel cropping affects biodiversity."

To determine the landscape characteristics that facilitate the occurrence of B. muscorum, grid-based observation records were analysed in a GIS environment at a regional scale. A significantly negative effect of the number of trees on the occurrence of B. muscorum and a significantly positive one of the proportion of arable land, strongly support the species' preference for open landscapes. Yet, apart from open landscapes additional landscape features were shown to be important. A significantly positive effect of ditches in the final model revealed the importance of this landscape element for the occurrence of B. muscorum. This finding was additionally supported by recordings of nest-searching queens, nests, and flower visits along dithes. The positive effects of clover and fallow land indicate the species' need for suitable food resources throughout the season. Because B. muscorum exhibits small foraging ranges, it is essential that landscape elements that provide nesting sites, foraging habitats and undisturbed hibernation structures are next to each other. The low numbers of individuals of B. muscorum recorded indicate that the supply of these habitat elements may have reached a critical threshold in the study region. © Springer 2006.","effects of landscape elements on the distribution of the rare","The regional distribution pattern of Bombus muscorum was studied in"

In plants, contemporary pollen flow is typically modelled as a single spatial process, with pollen flow declining exponentially within a short distance of mother plants. However, growing evidence suggests that many species do not conform to these patterns, often showing an excess of long-distance dispersal events or sometimes even multimodality in dispersal kernels. This suggests that a single function might be insufficient to capture the true complexity of pollination, which in reality is often achieved by multiple pollinators that vary in their foraging ranges and interactions with the landscape. We reconstructed realized pollen flow and assessed pollen immigration for seven populations of the insect-pollinated herb Pulsatilla vulgaris. We quantified the effects of distance, floral resources and landscape composition over multiple spatial scales and tested the hypotheses that within-population pollen flow is related to resources and landscape context measured locally, and that among-population pollen flow is related to features measured at larger spatial scales. We found that pollen flow within populations was more likely to occur amongst near neighbours, but that among-population pollen flow was random with respect to source populations. We further found that local floral density could explain patterns of within-population pollination distances and population-level selfing rates, whereas pollen immigration rates were best explained by the proportion of forest within a radius of 500 m around focal populations. Synthesis. Together, our results suggest that within- and among-population contemporary pollen flow may be governed by different underlying processes, possibly related to differences in the foraging range and habitat use of bee species that contribute to pollination at different scales. This highlights the critical need for researchers to take a more pollinator-eyed view of contemporary pollen flow in plants by (1) recognizing that within- and among-population gene flow by pollen may depend on different sets of pollinators that respond to features at different spatial scales (2) considering additional factors that may alter attractiveness, detectability and accessibility of plants to pollinators beyond the effects of distance. © 2018 The Authors.

In this article, we analyzed the spatial patterns in worker body size and geographic range size for the 27 described species of honey ants, genus Myrmecocystus Wesmael, in the United States and Mexico, and especially the relationship between these 2 variables after statistically removing their spatial patterns. The 2 variables are correlated, but also displayed significant spatial patterns, as detected by trend surface and spatial autocorrelation analyses. After removing these spatial effects, worker body size and geographic range size were still positively correlated. The relationship, therefore, is not a consequence of spatial effects and it does follow Brown's model, which predicts that the geographic range size will have a positive slope on body size. In this model, the lower population densities caused by foraging activities and local territorial competition are associated with a large geographic range, avoiding stochastic extinction. Although this constraint in local population density does not necessarily hold for small organisms such as insects that could achieve high densities even in very small areas and patchy habitats, it may hold for social insects, especially ants, because of the local competition among colonies.","honey ants (genus myrmecocystus) macroecology: effect of spatial patterns on","Macroecology evaluates the partitioning of physical space and resources among"

Various endpoints of colony performance and foraging behavior were measured during and after exposure, including winter survival. Imidacloprid residues became diluted or non-detectable within colonies due to the processing of beebread and honey and the rapid metabolism of the chemical. Imidacloprid exposure doses up to 100 μg/kg had no significant effects on foraging activity or other colony performance indicators during and shortly after exposure. Diseases and pest species did not affect colony health but infestations of Varroa mites were significantly higher in exposed colonies. Honey stores indicated that exposed colonies may have avoided the contaminated food. Imidacloprid dose effects was delayed later in the summer, when colonies exposed to 20 and 100 μg/kg experienced higher rates of queen failure and broodless periods, which led to weaker colonies going into the winter. Pooled over two years, winter survival of colonies averaged 85.7, 72.4, 61.2 and 59.2% in the control, 5, 20 and 100 μg/kg treatment groups, respectively. Analysis of colony survival data showed a significant dose effect, and all contrast tests comparing survival between control and treatment groups were significant, except for colonies exposed to 5 μg/kg. Given the weight of evidence, chronic exposure to imidacloprid at the higher range of field doses (20 to 100 μg/kg) in pollen of certain treated crops could cause negative impacts on honey bee colony health and reduced overwintering success, but the most likely encountered high range of field doses relevant for seed-treated crops (5 μg/kg) had negligible effects on colony health and are unlikely a sole cause of colony declines. © 2015, Public Library of Science.

A comparative analysis of pollinators spectra has allowed to designate groups (subcomplexes) of plants with regard to dominance of various groups of pollinators: myiophylous (flies from the superfamily Muscomorha dominate), syphidophylous (flies from the family Syrphidae dominate), psychophylous (butterflies dominate), cantharophylous (beetles dominate), nonspecialized and specialized melittophylous (Apidae, mainly bumblebees, dominate). The belonging of plants to a specific subcomplex is defined mainly by the structure of flowers and inflorescences. Modes of mechanical and attractive isolation are discussed that lead to restriction of pollinators composition.

However the role of insects species in pollination is different and depends on the stamen and stigma length, flexibility of pedicle and feeding behaviour of insect inside flower. The possibility to take and to transport pollen grains usually increase with the size of insect. The nature of this correlation is determined by stamen and stigma length. Pollinators of G. palustre with short stamens and stigmas are smaller than those of Ch. angustifolium and G. pratense.

Nevertheless, intra-colonial chronic exposure could induce sublethal effects in young bees exposed to a wide range of pesticides present in these pollen loads. This study was aimed to both determine the survival rate and evaluate the sublethal effects on the hepato-nephrocitic system in response to continuous oral exposure to lower concentrations of neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (TXT) and picoxystrobin fungicide (PXT). Exposure to a single chemical and co-exposure to both pesticides were performed in newly emerged honeybee workers. A significant decrease in the bee survival rates was observed following exposure to TXT (0.001 ng a.i./μL) and PXT (0.018 ng a.i./μL), as well as following co-exposure to TXT+PXT/2. After five days of continuous exposure, TXT induced sub-lethal effects in the organs involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, such as the fat body and pericardial cells, and it also induced a significant increase in the hemocyte number. Thus, the hepato-nephrocitic system (HNS) reached the greatest level of activity of pericardial cells as an attempt to eliminate this toxic compound from hemolymph. The HNS was activated at low levels by PXT without an increase in the hemocyte number; however, the mobilization of neutral glycoconjugates from the trophocytes of the fat body was prominent only in this group. TXT and PXT co-exposure induced intermediary morphological effects in trophocytes and pericardial cells, but oenocytes from the fat body presented with atypical cytoplasm granulation only in this group. These data showed that the realistic concentrations of these pesticides are harmful to newly emerged Africanized honeybees, indicating that intra-colonial chronic exposure drastically reduces the longevity of bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticide (TXT) and the fungicide strobilurin (PXT) as in single and co-exposure. Additionally, the sublethal effects observed in the organs constituting the HNS suggest that the activation of this system, even during exposure to low concentrations of theses pesticides, is an attempt to maintain homeostasis of the bees.

It is becoming increasingly popular, in places such as North America and some European countries, to engage members of the general public and school pupils in the collection of scientific data to support long-term environmental monitoring. Participants in such schemes are generally volunteers and are referred to as citizen scientists. The Christmas bird count in the US is one of the worlds longest running citizen science projects whereby volunteers have been collecting data on birds on a specific day since 1900. Similar volunteer networks in Ireland have been in existence since the 1960s and were established to monitor the number and diversity of birds throughout the country. More recently, initiatives such as Greenwave (2006) and Nature Watch (2009) invite school children and members of the general public respectively, to record phenology data from a range of common species of plant, insect and bird. In addition, the Irish butterfly and bumblebee monitoring schemes engage volunteers to record data on sightings of these species. The primary purpose of all of these networks is to collect data by which to monitor changes in wildlife development and diversity, and in the case of Greenwave to involve children in hands-on, inquiry-based science. Together these various networks help raise awareness of key environmental issues, such as climate change and loss of biodiversity, while at the same time promote development of scientific skills among the general population. In addition, they provide valuable scientific data by which to track environmental change. Here we examine the role of citizen science in monitoring biodiversity in Ireland and conclude that some of the data collected in these networks can be used to fulfil Ireland's statutory obligations for nature conservation. In addition, a bee thought previously to be extinct has been rediscovered and a range expansion of a different bee has been confirmed. However, it also became apparent that some of the networks play more of an educational than a scientific role. Furthermore, we draw on experience from a range of citizen science projects to make recommendations on how best to establish new citizen science projects in Ireland and strengthen existing ones. © 2013 ISB.","the role of citizen science in monitoring biodiversity in ireland","Citizen science is proving to be an effective tool in"

They have a large number of foragers per nest, a high demand for invertebrate protein, a very wide range of prey, an ability to tolerate low temperatures, a tolerance of nest manipulation, and a colony life cycle that can span at least two summers. High numbers per nest and high nest densities can lead to the consumption of many kilograms of prey per hectare per year. Successful development of characteristics desired of a manageable predator, such as the ability to increase colony numbers by dividing and re-queening, and enhancement of multi-year colony existence, could result in management procedures for Vespula spp. wasps that are similar to those used for honey bees. Farmers could have wasp nests available when and where required and in the numbers desired.

About half of the species in the tribe are currently assigned to the genus Eucera and to a few other related genera. In this large genus complex, comprising ca. 390 species, the boundaries between genera remain ambiguous due to morphological intergradation among taxa. Using ca. 6700 aligned nucleotide sites from six gene fragments, 120 morphological characters, and more than 100 taxa, we present the first comprehensive molecular, morphological, and combined phylogenetic analyses of the ‘Eucera complex’. The revised generic classification that we propose is congruent with our phylogeny and maximizes both generic stability and ease of identification. Under this new classification most generic names are synonymized under an expanded genus Eucera. Thus, Tetralonia, Peponapis, Xenoglossa, Cemolobus, and Syntrichalonia are reduced to subgeneric rank within Eucera, and Synhalonia is retained as a subgenus of Eucera. Xenoglossodes is reestablished as a valid subgenus of Eucera while Tetraloniella is synonymized with Tetralonia and Cubitalia with Eucera. In contrast, we suggest that the venusta-group of species, currently placed in the subgenus Synhalonia, should be recognized as a new genus. Our results demonstrate the need to evaluate convergent loss or gain of important diagnostic traits to minimize the use of potentially homoplasious characters when establishing classifications. Lastly, we show that the Eucera complex originated in the Nearctic region in the late Oligocene, and dispersed twice into the Old World. The first dispersal event likely occurred 24.2–16.6 mya at a base of a clade of summer-active bees restricted to warm region of the Old World, and the second 13.9–12.3 mya at the base of a clade of spring-active bees found in cooler regions of the Holarctic.

The efficiency of recruitment with and without transmission of direction information in the waggle dance was quantified using artificial, plentiful unscented food sources and hives which were turned to a horizontal position to disrupt orientation of dancing bees and thereby eliminate the spatial information from dances. Transmission of location information seems to improve recruitment effect particularly at large distances. Recruitment declines more rapidly with distance if dances are disoriented, and for large distances it takes a few hours before a foraging group is established. However, this shows that even without dance information, foragers manage to recruit some bees to their food source. This process, however, is so slow that by the time a group of recruits has reached the food source, it may not be worth exploiting any more. Transmission of spatial information thus is especially important if distant food sources which often change in nectar availability are exploited.","significance of honeybee recruitment strategies depending on foraging distance (hymenoptera:","The importance of the spatial information which is communicated in"

We substantiate this claim using a behavioral test in which an alerting signal is transmitted from one colony to another by long distance air transport, so excluding all other modalities of information exchange. We then investigated the source of the pheromone and were able to show that a hexane extract from tergites V-VII of bumble bee workers elicits higher activity, like a successful forager does. Extracts from other glands, such as the mandibular, labial, hypopharyngeal, and Dufour's gland as well as extracts from other parts of the cuticle had no effect. This suggests that bumble bees possess a pheromone-producing gland, similar to the Nasanov gland in honey bees. Indeed, an extract from the honey bee Nasanov gland also proved to alert bumblebee workers, suggesting a possible homology of the glands.","bumble bees alert to food with pheromone from tergal gland","Foragers of Bombus terrestris are able to alert their nestmates"

Microsatellite molecular markers were used to genotype bees sampled from local nests and in mating swarms in order to identify the nests of origin of males and maternal genotypes of concerning queens. The distances from assigned nests to the mating swarms allowed us to estimate the distances travelled by males. A genetic relationship analysis was conducted to verify whether T. angustula males were closely related to nests where they aggregated. A pairwise relatedness analysis was also performed among all T. angustula males in each mating swarm. Our results demonstrated that T. angustula mating swarms received dozens to hundreds of males from several colonies (up to 70). Only two of the five mating swarms contained any males that were closely related to the bees from the new nests in construction. The relatedness among males was also extremely low. Yet, dispersal distance of T. angustula males ranged hundreds of meters up to 1.6 km, with evidence of reaching 2.25 km according to their flight radius obtained from their foraging area for locality.

Here, we tested whether the initial onset of an infection negatively impacts the flight behaviour of honey bee workers, which is an energetically demanding behaviour and a key component of foraging activities. To do this, we infected workers with the widespread fungal pathogen Nosema apis, which is recognised and killed by the honey bee immune system. We compared their survival and flight behaviour with non-infected individuals from the same cohort and colony using radio frequency identification tags (RFID). We found that over a time frame of four days post infection, Nosema did not increase mortality but workers quickly altered their flight behaviour and performed more flights of shorter duration. We conclude that parasitic infections influence foraging activities, which could reduce foraging ranges of colonies and impact their ability to provide pollination services. © The Author(s) 2016.","flight behaviour of honey bee (apis mellifera) workers is altered","Honey bees (Apis mellifera) host a wide range of parasites,"

The study landscape contained sown flower patches representing agri-environment options for pollinators. We found that, as expected, the B. ruderatus population was characterized by relatively low heterozygosity, number of alleles and colony density. Across all species, inbreeding was absent or present but weak (FIS = 0.01-0.02). Using queen genotypes reconstructed from worker sibships and colony locations estimated from the positions of workers within these sibships, we found that significant isolation by distance was absent in B. lapidarius, B. hortorum and B. ruderatus. In B. terrestris and B. pascuorum, it was present but weak; for example, in these two species, expected relatedness of queens founding colonies 1 m apart was 0.02.

Honey bees can tolerate high levels of many of these toxic compounds, including the alkaloid nicotine, in their diet without incurring apparent fitness costs. Very little is known about the underlying detoxification processes mediating this tolerance. We examined the metabolic fate of nicotine in newly emerged worker bees using radiolabeled nicotine and LC-MS/MS analysis to determine the kinetic distribution profile of nicotine as well as the absence or presence and identity of any nicotine-derived metabolites. Nicotine metabolism was extensive; virtually no unmetabolised nicotine were recovered from the rectum. The major metabolite found was 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl) butanoic acid, the end product of 2′C-oxidation of nicotine. It is the first time that 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl) butanoic acid has been identified in an insect as a catabolite of nicotine. Lower levels of cotinine, cotinine N-oxide, 3′hydroxy-cotinine, nicotine N-oxide and norcotinine were also detected. Our results demonstrated that formation of 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl) butanoic acid is quantitatively the most significant pathway of nicotine metabolism in honey bees and that the rapid excretion of unmetabolised nicotine does not contribute significantly to nicotine tolerance in honey bees. In nicotine-tolerant insects that do not rely on the rapid excretion of nicotine like the Lepidoptera, it is possible that the 2′C-oxidation of nicotine is the conserved metabolic pathway instead of the generally assumed 5′C-oxidation pathway. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","the metabolic fate of nectar nicotine in worker honey bees","Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are generalist pollinators that forage for"

Pollination is by bees or bats, raising the question of the evolutionary direction and frequency of pollinator shifts. Studies that investigated such shifts in other clades have suggested that bat pollination might be an evolutionary end point. Methods: Plastid and nuclear DNA sequences were obtained for 50 accessions representing 30 species of Cayaponia and close relatives, and analyses were carried out to test monophyly, infer divergence times, and reconstruct ancestral states for habitat preferences and pollination modes. Key results: The phylogeny shows that Cayaponia is monophyletic as long as Selysia (a genus with four species from Central and South America) is included. The required nomenclatural transfers are made in this paper. African and Madagascan accessions of C. africana form a clade that is part of a polytomy with Caribbean and South American species, and the inferred divergence time of 2-5 Ma implies a transoceanic dispersal event from the New World to Africa. The ancestral state reconstructions suggest that Cayaponia originated in tropical forests from where open savannas were reached several times and that bee pollination arose from bat pollination, roughly concomitant with the shifts from forests to savanna habitats. Conclusions: Cayaponia provides the first example of evolutionary transitions from bat to bee pollination as well as another instance of transoceanic dispersal from the New World to Africa. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.","the evolution of cayaponia (cucurbitaceae): repeated shifts from bat to","Premise of the study: The Cucurbitaceae genus Cayaponia comprises ∼60"

We investigated the responses of bees to pollen and nectar rewards, and the effects of these rewards on pollen deposition and fecundity in the hermaphroditic succulent shrub Aloe tenuior. Self-pollinated plants failed to set fruit, but their ovules were regularly penetrated by self-pollen tubes, which uniformly failed to develop into seeds as expected from ovarian self-incompatibility (or strong early inbreeding depression). Bees consistently foraged for pollen during the morning and early afternoon, but switched to nectar in the late afternoon. As a consequence of this differential foraging, we were able to test the relative contribution to fecundity of pollen- versus nectar-collecting flower visitors. We exposed emasculated and intact flowers in either the morning or late afternoon to foraging bees and showed that emasculation reduced pollen deposition by insects in the morning, but had little effect in the afternoon. Despite the potential for self-pollination to result in ovule discounting due to late-acting self-sterility, fecundity was severely reduced in artificially emasculated plants. Although there were temporal fluctuations in reward preference, most bee visits were for pollen rewards. Therefore the benefit of providing pollen that is accessible to bee foragers outweighs any potential costs to fitness in terms of gender interference in this species. © 2014 Duffy et al.","a temporal dimension to the influence of pollen rewards on","The net effect of pollen production on fecundity in plants"

This study examines genetic structure of Anelosimus studiosus, a spider exhibiting polymorphic social behaviour. Two phenotypes have been identified: an 'asocial' phenotype with solitary female nests and a 'social' phenotype with multi-female/communal nests. To address the questions of whether these phenotypes are differentiated populations and whether cooperative individuals are closely related, we used microsatellites to analyse individuals from both communal and solitary nests. We found no evidence of differentiation between social and solitary samples, implying high rates of interbreeding. This is consistent with the hypothesis that these phenotypes coexist as a behavioural polymorphism within populations. Pairwise relatedness coefficients were used to test whether cooperating individuals are more closely related than expected by chance. Pairwise relatedness of females sharing communal webs averaged 0.25, the level expected for half-siblings and significantly more closely related than random pairs from the population. Solitary females collected at similar distances to the communal spider pairs were also more closely related than expected by chance ( mean relatedness = 0.18), but less related than social pairs. These results imply that low dispersal contributes to increase likelihood of interaction between kin, but relatedness between social pairs is not explained by spatial structure alone.

This process is called path integration (PI). Although many methods of endowing mobile robots with outdoor localization have been developed recently, most of them are still prone to considerable drift and uncertainty. We tested several ant-inspired solutions to outdoor homing navigation problems on a legged robot using two optical sensors equipped with just 14 pixels, two of which were dedicated to an insect-inspired compass sensitive to ultraviolet light. When combined with two rotating polarized filters, this compass was equivalent to two costly arrays composed of 374 photosensors, each of which was tuned to a specific polarization angle.

The results for this absolute conditioning function and a previously determined function for differential conditioning were compared, and it is shown that the absolute conditioning function best explains the discrimination and flower constancy behaviour of bees that has previously been observed in natural settings. Modeling of the empirically determined absolute discrimination function allows for predictions of how bees would discriminate between flowers in complex foraging conditions that might include changes in the background and/or illumination colour. The absolute conditioning function should thus serve as an important guide for the evaluation of pollinator discriminations between flowers in natural settings, and for the understanding of why there may have been considerable evolutionary pressure on plants to evolve distinctive flower colours so as to promote flower constancy in important pollinators. © 2006 E.

The effect of similar colours on reducing foraging accuracy of bees is evident for colour distances high above discrimination threshold, which explains previous field observations showing that bees do not exhibit complete flower constancy unless flower colour between species is distinct. Bees tested in spectrally different illumination conditions experienced a significant decrease in their ability to discriminate between similar colours. The extent to which this happens differs in different areas of colour space, which is consistent with a von Kries-type model of colour constancy. We find that it would be beneficial for plant species to have highly distinctive colour signals to overcome limitations on the bees performance in reliably judging differences between similar colours. An exception to this finding was flowers that varied in shape, in which case bees used this cue to compensate for inaccuracies of colour vision. © Springer-Verlag 2003.","biological significance of distinguishing between similar colours in spectrally variable","Individual bumblebees were trained to choose between rewarded target flowers"

To reliably perform this task, bees combine both odometric and landmark cues, which potentially creates a dilemma since environments rich in odometric cues might be poor in salient landmark cues, and vice versa. In the present study, honeybees were provided with differential conditioning to images of complex natural scenes, in order to determine if they could reliably learn to discriminate between very similar scenes, and to recognise a learnt scene from a novel distractor scene. Choices made by individual bees were modelled with signal detection theory, and bees demonstrated an ability to discriminate between perceptually similar target and distractor views despite similar spatiotemporal content of the images. In a non-rewarded transfer test bees were also able to recognise target stimuli from novel distractors. These findings indicate that visual processing in bees is sufficiently accurate for recognising views of complex scenery as potential landmarks, which would enable bees flying in a forest to use trees both as landmark and/or odometric cues.","honeybees can recognise images of complex natural scenes for use","The ability to navigate long distances to find rewarding flowers"

The highest frequency of flower reflectance curves is consistent with data reported for the Northern Hemisphere. The subsequent mapping of Australian flower reflectances into a bee colour space reveals a very similar distribution of flower colour evolution to the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, flowering plants in Australia are likely to have independently evolved spectral signals that maximize colour discrimination by hymenoptera. Moreover, we found that the degree of variability in flower coloration for particular angiosperm species matched the range of reflectance colours that can only be discriminated by bees that have experienced differential conditioning. This observation suggests a requirement for plasticity in the nervous systems of pollinators to allow generalization of flowers of the same species while overcoming the possible presence of non-rewarding flower mimics.","parallel evolution of angiosperm colour signals: common evolutionary pressures linked","Flowering plants in Australia have been geographically isolated for more"

Here, I investigate covariation between striking geographic variation in pollinator fauna and the mating system of a widespread self-compatible wetland plant, Decodon verticillatus. Flower visitor surveys in two northern populations from Canada and three southern populations from the southeastern United States revealed that flowers in northern populations were visited primarily by bumblebees (30%), nonnative honeybees (39%), and small, apparently ineffective, pollinators including wasps, flies, and solitary bees (31%). In contrast, southern populations were visited by butterflies (27%), large native bees (Bombus and Xylocopa; 65%), and only rarely by honeybees (2%). The frequency of visits to inflorescences was also much higher in southern (mean = 3.3/h) than in northern populations (1.1/h). The foraging behavior of butterflies may enhance outcrossing by reducing geitonogamy, the predominant mode of self-fertilization in northern populations. Compared to bees, butterflies moved between inflorescences more frequently (64% vs. 43% of the time) and flew longer distances between inflorescences (medians = 50 vs. 25 cm). Despite large regional differences in visitor composition and movement patterns, multilocus estimates of the proportion of outcrossed progeny did not differ between five southern populations (mean ± SE = 0.75 ± 0.04; range = 0.65-0.87) and 10 northern populations (0.72 ± 0.02; 0.62-0.86). Similarly, the fixation index of mature plants did not differ from 0 in either northern or southern populations.

The use of vision-based odometry has been studied extensively in horizontal distance measurement, but not vertical distance measurement. The honey bee Apis mellifera and the stingless bee Melipona seminigra measure distance visually using optic flow-movement of images as they pass across the retina. The honey bees gauge height using image motion in the ventral visual field. The stingless bees forage at different tropical forest canopy levels, ranging up to 40 m at our site. Thus, estimating height would be advantageous. We provide the first evidence that the stingless bee Melipona panamica utilizes optic flow information to gauge not only distance traveled but also height above ground, by processing information primarily from the lateral visual field. After training bees to forage at a set height in a vertical tunnel lined with black and white stripes, we observed foragers that explored a new tunnel with no feeder. In a new tunnel, bees searched at the same height they were trained to. In a narrower tunnel, bees experienced more image motion and significantly lowered their search height. In a wider tunnel, bees experienced less image motion and searched at significantly greater heights. In a tunnel without optic cues, bees were disoriented and searched at random heights. A horizontal tunnel testing these variables similarly affected foraging, but bees exhibited less precision (greater variance in search positions). Accurately gauging flight height above ground may be crucial for this species and others that compete for resources located at heights ranging from ground level to the high tropical forest canopies. © 2012.

Despite the many comparative studies on organisms living in urban and non-urban areas, our knowledge on species responses to urban environments remains limited. For one, much of the ecological research has assumed that the environment changes in a linear fashion from the city core to the city edges, whereas in reality the environments within the cities are highly heterogeneous. Furthermore, studies on species responses to these highly variable ecosystems are often based on interspecific mean trait values, which ignore the potential for high levels of intraspecific variation among individuals in key functional traits. The current study investigated intraspecific functional trait differences for four functional traits associated with body size, mobility and resource selection among rural and urban populations of two common bumblebee species, Bombus pascuorum and Bombus lapidarius, in urban centres and adjacent rural areas in Switzerland. We document shifts in functional traits towards smaller individuals and higher multidimensional trait variation in urban populations compared to rural conspecifics of both species. This shows that urban individuals for both species are on average smaller sized but populations are distinctively different from rural population by increasing their trait richness and diversifying their trait combinations. In addition, we found bimodality in tongue length within urban B. pascuorum populations. Our results suggest that urban and rural populations possibly experience differential selection pressures resulting in trait differences across and among populations. We argue that variations in the respective foraging landscapes in cities leads to smaller sized but phenotypically more diverse populations, and drive functional trait divergence. © 2019 The Authors.

In addition, the relative effects of landscape composition (landscape heterogeneity) and landscape configuration (distance from seminatural grassland) on wild plant pollination, and the interaction between these landscape effects, have not been studied using landscape-level replication. We performed a field experiment to disentangle these landscape effects on the pollination of a native herb, the sticky catchfly (Lychnis viscaria), while accounting for the proportion of oilseed rape across landscapes and the local abundance of bee forage flowers. We measured pollen limitation (the degree to which seed set is pollen-limited), seed set, and seed set stability using potted plants placed in landscapes that differed in heterogeneity (composition) and distance from seminatural grassland (configuration). Pollen limitation and seed set in individual plants did not respond to landscape composition, landscape configuration, or proportion of oilseed rape. Instead, seed set increased with increasing local bee forage flower cover. However, we found within-plant variability in pollen limitation and seed set to increase with increasing distance from seminatural pasture. Our results suggest that average within-plant levels of pollen limitation and seed set respond less swiftly than the within-plant variability in pollen limitation and seed set to changes in landscape configuration.

However, little is known about how food availability limits bee populations, especially in high elevation areas. Foraging distances and relationships between forager densities and resource availability can provide insights into the potential for food limitation in mobile consumer populations. For example, if floral resources are limited, bee consumers should fly farther to forage, and they should be more abundant in areas with more flowers. I estimated subalpine bumble bee foraging distances by calculating forager recapture probabilities at increasing distances from eight marking locations. I measured forager and flower densities over the flowering season in six half-hectare plots. Because subalpine bumble bees have little time to build their colonies, they may forage over short distances and forager density may not be constrained by flower density. However, late in the season, when floral resources dwindle, foraging distances may increase, and there may be stronger relationships between forager and flower densities. Throughout the flowering season, marked bees were primarily found within 100 m (and never >l, 000 m) from their original marking location, suggesting that they typically did not fly far to forage. Although the density of early season foraging queens increased with early-season flower density, the density of mid- and late-season workers and males did not vary with flower density. Short foraging distances and no relationships between mid- and late-season forager and flower densities suggest that high elevation bumble bees may have ample floral resources for colony growth reproduction. © 2009 Entomological Society of America.","subalpine bumble bee foraging distances and densities in relation to","Bees feed almost exclusively on nectar and pollen from flowers."

These experiments are the first to examine directly the impact of honey bee, Apis mellifera, nest invaders on plant pollination and fitness. A cost to pollination could occur under two scenarios: (1) at the colony level where nest invaders compromise the health of the foraging cohort and reduce their efficacy as pollinators or (2) at the community level where invaders simply kill bee colonies and reduce the local pollinator population. Honey bee colonies were manipulated to achieve different levels of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor or nest-invading beetle Aethina tumida and tented under one of two model plants: canola (Brassica napus) or rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei).

Here, for the first time, we assess genetic diversity and population structuring of a threatened bumblebee species (Bombus sylvarum) which exists in highly fragmented habitat (rather than oceanic) islands. Effective population sizes, estimated from identified sisterhoods, were very low (range 21-72) suggesting that isolated populations will be vulnerable to loss of genetic variation through drift. Evidence of significant genetic structuring between populations (theta = 0.084) was found, but evidence of a bottleneck was detected in only one population. Comparison across highly fragmented UK populations and a continental population (where this species is more widespread) revealed significant differences in allelic richness attributable to a high degree of genetic diversity in the continental population. While not directly related to population size, this is perhaps explained by the high degree of isolation between UK populations relative to continental populations.

In an analysis on total diet composition intraspecific similarity was much greater than interspecific similarity. The focal colony of Trigona collina from the mixed aggregation distinctly clustered according to species rather than nest location, suggesting that some interspecific resource partitioning occurs. The sampling period was accompanied by a drastic increase in flowering activity as evidenced by data from a flower phenology transect. At times of limited flowering similarity of pollen diets was generally low, both within and between species. It is hypothesized that this is so because bees are forced to forage from scattered subsets of flower patches spread out over a large foraging range. In times of increased flowering pollen diet similarity significantly increased between colonies of the monospecific aggregation, presumably because colonies concentrated on more profitable sources in closer proximity.

Interpreting fine-scale genetic structure in the light of these two processes is confounded by the recent imposition of anthropogenic disturbances with potentially contrasting genetic consequences: (1) the unusual foraging behaviour of exotic honeybees and 2. widespread disturbance of the soil-stored seedbank by road building and quarrying. To test for evidence of fine-scale genetic structure within G. macleayana populations and to test the prediction that such structure might be masked by disturbance of the seed bank, we sampled two sites in undisturbed habitat and compared their genetic structure with two sites that had been strongly affected by road building using a test for spatial autocorrelation of genotypes. High selfing levels inferred from genotypes at all four sites implies that pollen dispersal is limited. Consistent with this, we observed substantial spatial clustering of genes at 10 m or less in the two undisturbed populations and argue that this reflects the predicted effects of both high selfing levels and limited seed dispersal. In contrast, at the two sites disturbed by road building, spatial autocorrelation was weak. This suggests there has been mixing of the seed bank, counteracting the naturally low dispersal and elevated selfing due to honeybees. Pollination between near neighbours with reduced relatedness potentially has fitness consequences for G. macleayana in disturbed sites.","effects of seed bank disturbance on the fine-scale genetic structure","Dispersal in most plants is mediated by the movement of"

The beetles were marked individually and tracked throughout their visits to Viburnum opulus L. (Caprifoliaceae), a partly beetle-pollinated shrub displaying large umbel-like, creamy-white blossoms. Beetle abundance differed greatly between study years. Of marked beetles observed on V. opulus flowers, an average of 26% returned each year. The beetles performed frequent inter-plant flights, and showed fidelity to particular V. opulus individuals at the study site. Furthermore, they preferred V. opulus to other plants flowering concomitantly and showed considerable constancy in this habit. Movements were mostly between individuals from unshaded locations with high inflorescence and flower number. Normally, the beetles flew on average about 4 times the horizontal nearest-neighbour distance between flowering V. opulus (c. 18 m). From these observations it is concluded that Cetonia beetles are powerful long-distance dispersal agents for V. opulus pollen, perhaps leading to an enhanced gene flow not possible with the plant's other pollinators.","movement patterns of cetonia beetles (scarabaeidae) among flowering viburnum-opulus (caprifoliaceae)","The movement patterns of flower-visiting Cetonia (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae) were studied"

However, their role in supporting broad pollinator biodiversity is not well established as previous studies have been conducted in urban landscapes with pollinator communities that are distinct from those in natural systems. We observed pollinator visitation patterns to five ornamental annual plant genera and their cultivars over multiple years at two semi-natural sites in Pennsylvania to understand their potential for supporting diverse pollinator communities. There was significant variation in visitor abundance and diversity by season and year for many annual ornamental cultivars. Within some genera, cultivars had similar visitor abundance, diversity, and main visitor taxa, while cultivars in other genera varied greatly in these measures. We observed only polylectic (pollen generalist) bee species visiting annual ornamentals, despite the presence of oligolectic (pollen specialist) bee species in the background population. We conclude that the attractiveness of annual ornamental plants likely depends on both cultivar characteristics and environmental context. While their role in supporting complex pollinator populations is limited both based on the number of and dietary breadth of the species they support, ornamental plants may nonetheless provide long-lasting supplemental foraging resources for the generalist pollinator communities characteristic of urban and suburban environments.","more than meets the eye? the role of annual ornamental","Ornamental flowers are commonly planted in urban and suburban areas"

However, relying on biotic pollen dispersers also exposes plants to challenges, which include, for instance, the need to match the ecologies and phenologies of the pollinator species. Because of their ecological simplicity, specialized pollination systems are useful models to understand some of the variables that modulate how zoophilous pollination evolves, and whether or not species involved in pollination interactions respond jointly to evolutionary or ecological processes. In this study, we used a combination of field work, species distribution modeling (SDM), and geospatial analyses to investigate whether the number of floral visits by different pollinators in specialized zoophilous pollination interactions is correlated with the climatic suitability of the pollinator insects and, thus, to insect potential abundance. To do this, we investigated the pollination biology of four Calceolaria L. (Calceolariacea) species from central Chile, and we sampled across their whole ranges. Our results indicate that the four plant species are pollinated by different oil-bees of genera Centris Fabricius (Apidae: Centridini) and Chalepogenus Holmberg (Apidae: Tapinotaspidini), and that the number of floral visits varies at different localities. Our SDMs were accurate, successfully recovering the known ranges of the pollinators. Our analyses indicated that most plant species occur at localities in which insect climatic suitabilities are high. Furthermore, the number of pollinator visits at each locality was significantly and positively correlated with the insect suitability values, suggesting that matching high suitability areas can indeed increase the reproductive success of the plants. © The Author(s) 2018.

A third study investigating sub-lethal effects on honeybees for clothianidin and imidacloprid was also considered (Schneider et al., 2012). Data of uses authorised in EU and data on residues in pollen and nectar were collected to compare the actual exposure of bees with the investigated doses. The residue data were limited and available only for some crops; therefore, the extrapolation to other crops was not considered appropriate. In the studies on honeybees, the highest residue levels of thiamethoxam, clothianidin and imidacloprid in nectar were compared with the actual concentrations tested. The results indicated that the tested concentrations were higher than the concentrations found in nectar. The residue intake was estimated using different exposure scenarios. The results indicated that the doses tested in these publications were lower for clothianidin and for thiamethoxam than the estimated exposure. For imidacloprid the doses tested were higher in all the scenarios. In the studies on honeybees, the total amount of active substance was consumed by honeybees within a relatively short period instead of being not administrated over a longer period i.e a day. In the study on bumblebees the tested concentrations were in the range of the highest residues of imidacloprid in pollen and nectar.

Currently, it is removed by many beekeepers as part of a strategy to lower the population of the destructive Varroa mite (Varroa destructor) in the hive, but most often it is disposed of. A descriptive sensory analysis of drone brood was conducted, using larvae and pupae from four hives, three in Denmark and one in Norway, from locations spanning a range of urban/rural and monocultural/polycultural surroundings. Data were collected with a panel of 10 subjects using fast sensory methods, and were analysed with analysis of variance-partial least squares regression. The first dimension accounted for 40% of the variance, and correlated closely with differences in developmental stage between larvae and pupae; the second dimension accounted for 16% of the variance, and most closely grouped samples from three of the locations apart from those of the fourth. Developmental stage was thus found to be the primary determinant of sensory profile, followed by variations in locality, possibly related to local forage.

Pollinator foraging varies with the diversity, abundance, and spatial configuration of floral resources. However, the implications of this variation for pollen transfer and ultimately the reproductive success of insect pollinated plants remains unclear, especially for species which are rare or isolated in the landscape. We used a landscape-scale experiment, coupled with microsatellite genotyping, to explore how the floral richness of habitats affected pollinator behavior and pollination effectiveness. Small arrays of the partially self-compatible plant Californian poppy (Eschscholzia californica) were introduced across a landscape gradient to simulate rare, spatially isolated populations. The effects on pollinator activity, outcrossing, and plant reproduction were measured. In florally rich habitats, we found reduced pollen movement between plants, leading to fewer long-distance pollination events, lower plant outcrossing, and a higher incidence of pollen limitation. This pattern indicates a potential reduction in per capita pollinator visitation, as suggested by the lower activity densities and richness of pollinators observed within florally rich habitats. In addition, seed production reduced by a factor of 1.8 in plants within florally rich habitats and progeny germination reduced by a factor of 1.2. We show this to be a consequence of self-fertilization within the partially self-compatible plant, E. californica. These findings indicate that locally rare plants are at a competitive disadvantage within florally rich habitats because neighboring plant species disrupt conspecific mating by co-opting pollinators. Ultimately, this Allee effect may play an important role in determining the long-term persistence of rarer plants in the landscape, both in terms of seed production and viability. Community context therefore requires consideration when designing and implementing conservation management for plants which are comparatively rare in the landscape.","florally rich habitats reduce insect pollination and the reproductive success","Landscape heterogeneity in floral communities has the potential to modify"

During daily foraging in agricultural landscapes, they encounter a mosaic of patches with nest and foraging habitat and unsuitable matrix. It is insufficiently clear how spatial allocation of nesting and foraging resources and foraging traits of bees affect their daily foraging performance. We investigated potential brood cell construction (as proxy of fitness), number of visited flowers, foraging habitat visitation and foraging distance (pollination proxies) with the model SOLBEE (simulating pollen transport by solitary bees, tested and validated in an earlier study), for landscapes varying in landscape fragmentation and spatial allocation of nesting and foraging resources. Simulated bees varied in body size and nesting preference. We aimed to understand effects of landscape fragmentation and bee traits on bee fitness and the pollination services bees provide, as well as interactions between them, and the general consequences it has to our understanding of the system. This broad scope gives multiple key results. 1) Body size determines fitness more than landscape fragmentation, with large bees building fewer brood cells. High pollen requirements for large bees and the related high time budgets for visiting many flowers may not compensate for faster flight speeds and short handling times on flowers, giving them overall a disadvantage compared to small bees. 2) Nest preference does affect distribution of bees over the landscape, with cavity-nesting bees being restricted to nesting along field edges, which inevitably leads to performance reductions. Fragmentation mitigates this for cavity-nesting bees through increased edge habitat. 3) Landscape fragmentation alone had a relatively small effect on all responses. Instead, the local ratio of nest to foraging habitat affected bee fitness positively through reduced local competition. The spatial coverage of pollination increases steeply in response to this ratio for all bee sizes. The nest to foraging habitat ratio, a strong habitat proxy incorporating fragmentation could be a promising and practical measure for comparing landscape suitability for pollinators. 4) The number of flower visits was hardly affected by resource allocation, but predominantly by bee size. 5) In landscapes with the highest visitation coverage, bees flew least far, suggesting that these pollination proxies are subject to a trade-off between either longer pollen transport distances or a better pollination coverage, linked to how nests are distributed over the landscape rather than being affected by bee size. © 2018 Everaars et al.

One little-studied interaction is phoresy, where an individual of one species attaches itself to an individual of another species for the purpose of dispersal. Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are important crop pollinators around the world and at least 10 species of phoretic mites have been associated with various bumble bee species. Here, we investigated changes in the abundance of the introduced European B. terrestris across forest-grassland edges in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, and concomitant changes in the phoretic mite loads on these mobile pollinators. Bumble bees penetrated up to 250 m inside forest fragments, with abundance declining with distance from the anthropogenic matrix habitat. By contrast, phoretic mite loads increased towards the forest interior. Overall, phoretic mite loads on B. terrestris were greatest in the forest canopy, suggesting that this species interaction is intensified in natural habitat compared to that in the anthropogenic land use surrounding forest fragments.

Our analyses of six polymorphic microsatellites show that the populations are only slightly differentiated, suggesting a relatively strong gene flow. No genetic structure corresponding to the geographic origin was found as the variability within populations accounted for the major proportion of variation. F-ST values were higher and allelic richness was lower in the Lower Rhine valley, supporting the hypothesis that habitat availability affects the degree of genetic exchange between populations.

Adult drones exhibit a much higher metabolic rate (up to 19.7-fold at 20 °C) than juveniles with strong fluctuations in the power-time curves. Fertile queens show a less pronounced heat production rate than virgin queens (54% at 30 °C, 87% at 25 °C and 77% at 20 °C). Calorimetric unrest is much higher for young than for adult queens. Heat production is very low in both uncapped and capped brood and less than 30% of that of a newly emerged worker. In most cases temperature showed a significant influence on the metabolic level, although its sign was not homogeneous between the castes or even within them. Locomotor activities are easily recorded by the acoustic frequency spectrum (0-7.5 kHz) and in good agreement with endoscopic observations and calorimetric traces. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.","calorimetric investigations of the different castes of honey bees, apis","Honey bees of different age and castes were investigated calorimetrically"

This cuticular maturation heterochrony may be associated with life style, considering that eusocial bees remain protected inside the nest for many days after emergence, while the solitary bees immediately start outside activities. To address this issue, we characterized gene expression using large-scale RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and quantified cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in comparative studies of the integument (cuticle plus its underlying epidermis) of two eusocial and a solitary bee species. In addition, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for studying the developing cuticle of these and other three bee species also differing in life style. We found 13,200, 55,209 and 30,161 transcript types in the integument of the eusocial Apis mellifera and Frieseomelitta varia, and the solitary Centris analis, respectively. In general, structural cuticle proteins and chitin-related genes were upregulated in pharate-adults and newly-emerged bees whereas transcripts for odorant binding proteins, cytochrome P450 and antioxidant proteins were overrepresented in foragers. Consistent with our hypothesis, a distance correlation analysis based on the differentially expressed genes suggested delayed cuticle maturation in A. mellifera in comparison to the solitary bee. However, this was not confirmed in the comparison with F. varia. The expression profiles of 27 of 119 genes displaying functional attributes related to cuticle formation/differentiation were positively correlated between A. mellifera and F. varia, and negatively or non-correlated with C. analis, suggesting roles in cuticular maturation heterochrony. However, we also found transcript profiles positively correlated between each one of the eusocial species and C. analis. Gene co-expression networks greatly differed between the bee species, but we identified common gene interactions exclusively between the eusocial species. Except for F. varia, the TEM analysis is consistent with cuticle development timing adapted to the social or solitary life style. In support to our hypothesis, the absolute quantities of n-alkanes and unsaturated CHCs were significantly higher in foragers than in the earlier developmental phases of the eusocial bees, but did not discriminate newly-emerged from foragers in C. analis. By highlighting differences in integument gene expression, cuticle ultrastructure, and CHC profiles between eusocial and solitary bees, our data provided insights into the process of heterochronic cuticle maturation associated to the way of life. © 2019 Falcon et al.

Differing effects have been identified on physiology and behavior by Wolbachia. However, the effect of Wolbachia infection on the learning ability of their host had never previously been studied. The current study carried out to compare learning ability and memory duration in 2 strains of the parasitoid Trichogramma brassicae: 1 uninfected and 1 infected by Wolbachia. Both strains were able to associate the novel odors with the reward of an oviposition into a host egg. However, the percentage of females that responded to the experimental design and displayed an ability to learn in these conditions was higher in the uninfected strain. Memory duration was longer in uninfected wasps (23.8 and 21.4 h after conditioning with peppermint and lemon, respectively) than in infected wasps (18.9 and 16.2 h after conditioning with peppermint and lemon, respectively). Memory retention increased in response to the number of conditioning sessions in both strains, but memory retention was always shorter in the infected wasps than in the uninfected ones. Wolbachia infection may select for reduced memory retention because shorter memory induces infected wasps to disperse in new environments and avoid competition with uninfected wasps by forgetting cues related to previously visited environments, thus increasing transmission of Wolbachia in new environments.","decrease of memory retention in a parasitic wasp: an effect","Several factors, such as cold exposure, aging, the number of"

Behavioural parameters of dancing, such as probability, duration and dance tempo, increased with the nectar flow rate, though with very different response curves among bees. For trophallaxis (i.e. mouth-to-mouth exchange of food), the frequency of givingcontacts and the transfer rate of the nectar increased with the nectar flow rate. After unloading, foragers often approached other nest mates and begged for food before returning to the food source. This behaviour was less frequent at higher nectar flow rates. These results show that the profitability of a food source in terms of nectar flow rate had a quantitative representation in the hive through quantitative changes in trophallactic and dancing behaviour.

In the case of honeybees, foragers returning from a nectar source transfer the food collected to receiver colony-mates through oral contact. Previous studies have shown that the speed of nectar transfer within each contact (unloading rate) increases when foragers return from feeding sites with higher profitability, i.e. with more concentrated sugar solutions or higher solution flow rates. However, there is no evidence that the nectar unloading rate is actually evaluated by hive-mates during food exchange. To investigate this, trophallaxis between donor bees returning from a feeder with different flow rates of sucrose solution (range 1.0-8.2 μl min-1 of 50 % w/w sucrose solution) and receiver hive-mates was studied by combining behavioural and infrared thermal analysis. The results show that when foraging bees returned from a feeder delivering a higher flow rate they initiated unloading at higher thoracic temperatures and transferred the solution at higher speed. During these food exchanges, the thoraces of receiver bees warmed up faster in proportion to increasing forager temperature and unloading rate. Therefore, whatever the variable actually evaluated by receivers (mostly nectar processors, i.e. bees that handle nectar in the hive) during trophallaxis (unloading rate and/or donor thoracic temperature), they raised their activity level in proportion to that of the foragers. In this way, receiver bees will intensify their nectar processing when nectar foragers return from more profitable sites.","changes in the thoracic temperature of honeybees while receiving nectar","Mouth-to-mouth food exchange in eusocial insects (trophallaxis) contributes to the"

In this study, we demonstrate that prior knowledge of insect colour preferences can be used to facilitate acuity testing. We focused on four psyllid species (Hemiptera: Psylloidea: Aphalaridae), namely Ctenarytaina eucalypti, Ctenarytaina bipartita, Anoeconeossa bundoorensis and Glycaspis brimblecombei, that differ in their colour preferences and utilization of different host-plant modules (e.g. apical buds, stems, leaf lamellae) and tested their visual acuity in a modified Y-maze adapted to suit psyllid searching behaviour. Our study revealed that psyllids have visual acuity ranging from 6.3 to 8.7 deg. Morphological measurements for different species showed a close match between inter-ommatidial angles and behaviourally determined visual angles (between 5.5 and 6.6 deg) suggesting detection of colour stimuli at the single ommatidium level. Whilst our data support isometric scaling of psyllids' eyes for C. eucalypti, C. bipartita and G. brimblecombei, a morphological trade-off between light sensitivity and spatial resolution was found in A. bundoorensis. Overall, species whose microhabitat preferences require more movement between modules appear to possess superior visual acuity. The psyllid searching behaviours that we describe with the help of tracking software depict species-specific strategies that presumably evolved to optimize searching for food and oviposition sites.","visual acuity trade-offs and microhabitat-driven adaptation of searching behaviour in","Insects have evolved morphological and physiological adaptations in response to"

Here, we describe an experimental study to determine the fitness consequences of phenological shifts in blue orchard bee (Osmia lignaria) emergence, compare the measured seasonal fitness landscape with observed phenology in the unmanipulated population, and assess seasonal variation in key factors related to reproduction, foraging, and brood parasitism that were expected to affect the shape of the fitness landscape. By tracking individually marked females, we were able to estimate the lifetime fitness impacts of phenological advances and delays. We also measured parasitism risk, floral resource use, and nesting behavior to understand how each varies seasonally, and their combined effects on realized fitness. Survival to nesting decreased non-monotonically throughout the season, with a 20.4% decline in survival rates between the first and second cohorts. The total reproductive output per maternal bee was 14.9% higher in the second cohort compared to the first, and 161% higher in the second cohort compared to the third. Combining seasonal patterns in survival and reproductive output, experimentally advanced females showed 30.6% higher fitness than bees released at the historic peak. In contrast, the nesting phenology of unmanipulated bees showed nearly equal numbers of nesting attempts in the first two cohorts. Both increased resource availability and reduced parasitism risk favored earlier emergence. These results are consistent with a population experiencing directional selection for earlier emergence, adaptive bet-hedging, or developmental constraints.

We evaluated their nest-searching behaviour in different test situations to elucidate the nature of the visual marks they used in this task. When we modified or removed geometrical figures surrounding the nest, the bees searched for longer, showing that they noticed the introduced changes. However, these manipulations never prevented bees from finding their nest, suggesting that other visual cues were crucial in the task. Manipulations of the edges provided by the boundaries of the device (nest block, metal sheet on which the block was mounted) strongly impaired the homing performance. The further away the edges that were left intact, the stronger was the impairment of the homing behaviour. These results suggest that bees learn the distances of the various edges from the goal and that edges have a hierarchical significance according to their distance from the nest. The most distant edges provide vague information, which suffices to guide the insect towards the next edge in the sequence, until it recognizes the final, precise location of the nest. The results support the conclusion that information on distances is acquired using cues derived from motion parallax generated by the insect's self-motion. Recognition of edge parameters such as position and orientation might be achieved by an image-matching mechanism based on dynamic processes.

Each forager bee displays a tendency of loyalty toward specific plant species during the many daily foraging flights. Due to the ease of collection, pollen loads have been extensively used as a proxy for detection of pesticide residues. Pollen is the main protein food source for colonies, and its contamination has also been addressed as a reason for the colony losses phenomenon. As honeybees fly over a variable but wide range territory, they might collect pollen from both agricultural, urban and wild environments, also displaying considerable preferences in botanical sources between colonies of the same apiary. It is thus difficult to address the source of the pesticide contamination, when pollen is analyzed as a whole. In the current study, a practical and reliable approach has been proposed to narrow down the source of contamination. Pollen loads have been collected from colonies placed in eight locations over large apple orchard extensions in Trentino-South Tyrol region (Italy), during and 2 weeks after apple blossom. The pollen loads have been separated by the color due to the predominant plant species. On each color group, palynology and multi-residual chemical analyses have been performed in parallel. The pollen hazard quotient (PHQ) was used to estimate the risk to honeybees of each color group and of the total collected pollen. Apple and dandelion pollen were the main portions of the first collection, while a greater variety emerged after the apple blossom. Dandelion was always present in the samples. The frequency and the amount of pesticide residues differed according to the collection periods, the locations and the pollen color groups. The amount of insecticide residues increased after the apple blossom, while no difference between the period was found on fungicide residues. The PHQ values were higher after the blossom due to the insecticide contribution, with highest values of 160,000 and 150,000. The variations within samples did not allow to identify a unique source of contamination, whereas it seems that the pollen from plants outside the agricultural areas has as much residues as the pollen from apple orchards. © Copyright © 2019 Favaro, Bauer, Rossi, D’Ambrosio, Bucher and Angeli.","botanical origin of pesticide residues in pollen loads collected by","Honeybees closely rely on insect-pollinated plants for their survival.

The islands had lower species richness and population than mainland forest, but rarefied species richness was relatively invariant across sites. There was a marked change in species composition with decreasing fragment that was not caused by the presence of a common fauna of disturbed area species on islands. Small islands differed from larger islands, which did not differ significantly from mainland sites.

We studied Argentine ant populations in the native range in Argentina and in three invaded regions along an introduction pathway: California, Australia and New Zealand. In each region, we set up 32 experimental colonies to measure foraging activity and interspecific aggression in a subset of the study regions. These colonies were subject to experimental manipulation of carbohydrate availability and octopamine, a biogenic amine known to modulate behaviour in insects, to measure variation in behavioural plasticity. We found variation in foraging activity among populations, but this variation was not consistent with selection on behaviour in relation to the invasion process. We found that colonies with limited access to carbohydrates exhibited unchanged exploratory behaviour, but higher exploitation activity and lower aggression. Colonies given octopamine consistently increased foraging behaviour (both exploration and exploitation), as well as aggression when also sugar-deprived. There was no difference in the degree of behavioural response to our experimental treatments along the introduction pathway. We did not find support for selection of behavioural traits associated with invasiveness along the Argentine ant's introduction pathway or clear evidence for an association between the introduction process and variation in behavioural plasticity. These results indicate that mechanisms promote behavioural variation in a similar fashion both in native and introduced ranges. Our results challenge the assumption that introduced populations always perform better in key behavioural traits hypothesised to be associated with invasion success.","behavioural variation and plasticity along an invasive ant introduction pathway","Once established in new areas, introduced species may exhibit changes"

Therefore, we studied the impact of the highly invasive Solidago canadensis on plant and pollinator communities along a gradient of invasion severity in old fields with different ages (1-20 years since last ploughing) in Southern Transylvania, Romania. We asked whether the invasion of S. canadensis causes shifts in (1) the composition and diversity of plant communities, and (2) pollinator communities along the successional gradient. Further, we asked (3) to what extent the presence of S. canadensis affected flower visitation of native plant species by pollinators. According to our results, the invasion reduced the native plant species richness throughout succession, although the most profound negative effect on plant diversity and vegetation naturalness was exerted in older successional communities. The invasion of S. canadensis had a negative effect on the abundance of bees irrespective of the old field age; however, there was no similar negative effect on hoverflies. Native flowers experienced reduced visitation by wild bees, honey bees and hoverflies due to the augmented presence of S. canadensis. Therefore, the invasion of this perennial plant species diverts the trajectory of vegetation succession, alters the mutualistic links between the native elements of these old fields, and causes a non-desired alternative stable states to be installed.","solidago canadensis impacts on native plant and pollinator communities in","Secondary succession in former arable fields (i.e. old fields) might"

They use visual memories of the surrounding scene and probably compass information to control their direction. Do they also remember the length of their route and do they link memories of direction and distance? To answer these questions, we trained wood ant (Formica rufa) foragers in a channel to perform either a single short foraging route or two foraging routes in opposite directions. By shifting the starting position of the route within the channel, but keeping the direction and distance fixed, we tried to ensure that the ants would rely upon vector memories rather than visual memories to decide when to stop. The homeward memories that the ants formed were revealed by placing fed or unfed ants directly into a channel and assessing the direction and distance that they walked without prior performance of the food-ward leg of the journey. This procedure prevented the distance and direction walked being affected by a home vector derived from path integration. Ants that were unfed walked in the feeder direction. Fed ants walked in the opposite direction for a distance related to the separation between start and feeder. Vector memories of a return route can thus be primed by the ants' feeding state and expressed even when the ants have not performed the food-ward route. Tests on ants that have acquired two routes indicate that memories of the direction and distance of the return routes are linked, suggesting that they may be encoded by a common neural population within the ant brain.","acquisition and expression of memories of distance and direction in","Wood ants, like other central place foragers, rely on route"

By capturing hive bees that landed at the feeder in a 2-h period, the arrival rate of incoming bees could be obtained. With this procedure we quantitatively analyzed the maximum number of hive bees that can be brought to the feeding station by single foragers. Test bees collected sucrose solution during 12 visits to a rate-feeder located 160 m from the hive. The constant programs offered 0.6, 1.2, or 2.4 M sugar for all 12 visits, while the variable programs delivered either 0.6, 1.2, or 0.6 M or 0.6, 2.4, or 0.6 M, with four visits for each molarity. Results showed that the sucrose concentration exploited by single foragers increased the arrival rate. Moreover, there was a linear relationship within this range of sucrose concentrations that presented a slope of 1.58. Since the sugar solutions were provided at the same flow rate (5 μl/min) in all the programs, the arrival rate expressed in terms of sucrose flow rate (milligrams of sucrose/minute) shows that one additional incoming bee per hour arrived when the single forager assessed an increase in the sucrose flow rate of 0.75 mg sucrose/min at the rate-feeder. The absence of differences in the frequency of visits of the single foragers during the constant programs suggests that the differences observed in the arrival rate can mainly be explained by a more intensive display of the recruitment mechanisms performed per foraging trip instead of by their iterativeness throughout different foraging cycles. Variable reward programs showed that arrival rate is rapidly adjusted according to the reward change and is independent of its magnitude.","individual recruitment in honeybees, apis mellifera l. the effect of","The recruitment of honeybee foragers individually exploiting a low-flow rate-feeder"

Results of these studies range from strong to nil effect among the variety of species, fitness measurements and damage modes studied, suggesting that not all damage modes are equal and that insects may be well adapted to compensate for some types of damage. Here, we examine the biomechanical and neuromuscular means by which flying insects compensate for asymmetric wing damage, which is expected to produce asymmetric flight forces and torques and thus destabilize the animal in addition to reducing its total wing size. We measured the kinematic and neuromuscular responses of hawkmoths (Manduca sexta) hovering in free flight with asymmetrically damaged wings via high-speed videography and extracellular neuromuscular activity recordings. The animals responded to asymmetric wing damage with asymmetric changes to wing stroke amplitude sufficient to restore symmetry in lift production. These asymmetries in stroke amplitude were significantly correlated with bilateral asymmetries in the timing of activation of the dorsal ventral muscle among and within trials. Correspondingly, the magnitude of wing asymmetry was significantly, although non-linearly, correlated with the magnitude of the neuromuscular response among individuals. The strongly non-linear nature of the relationship suggests that active neural compensation for asymmetric wing damage may only be necessary above a threshold (>12% asymmetry in wing second moment of area in this case) below which passive mechanisms may be adequate to maintain flight stability.","neuromuscular and biomechanical compensation for wing asymmetry in insect hovering","Wing damage is common in flying insects and has been"

Treated and untreated foragers were released at varying distances from their hives and their return rates were monitored. Significant differences in their return rates indicated that interactions existed between forager losses and exposure to both static and oscillating magnetic fields, as well as during fluctuations in the Earth's magnetosphere. In addition, D. decreases in untreated forager return rates also correlated with increasing intensity of extraterrestrial protons that entered Earth's atmosphere. Finally, winter colony losses in the northeast USA also correlated with annual geomagnetic storm occurrences. Collectively, these five observations indicate that coronal eruptions on the Sun are involved with interference of a forager's magnetoreception sense here on Earth.

We investigated the effect of colony-level selection for pollen storage levels on the foraging behavior of individual honeybee foragers to determine (1) the relationship between genotype and phenotypic expression of foraging traits at the individual level and (2) how genetically based variation in worker task phenotype is integrated into colony task organization. We placed workers from lines selected at the colony level for high or low pollen stores together with hybrid workers into a common hive environment with controlled access to resources. Workers from the selected lines showed reciprocal variation in pollen and nectar collection. High-pollen-line foragers collected pollen preferentially, and low-pollen-line workers collected nectar, indicating that the two tasks covary genetically. Hybrid workers were not intermediate in phenotype, but instead showed directional dominance for nectar collection. We monitored the responses of workers from the selected strains to changes in internal (colony) and external (resource) stimulus levels for pollen foraging to measure the interaction between genotypic variation in foraging behavior and stimulus environment. Under low-stimulus conditions, the foraging group was over-represented by high-pollen-line workers. However, the evenness in distribution of the focal genetic groups increased as foraging stimuli increased. These data are consistent with a model where task choice is a consequence of genetically based response thresholds, and where genotypic diversity allows colony flexibility by providing a range of stimulus thresholds.","colony-level selection effects on individual and colony foraging task performance","In honeybees, as in other highly eusocial species, tasks are"

To vary resource profitability, we changed the quantity of artificial nectar baits presented to foragers and the distance of nectar baits from the nest. Both distance to and amount of resource affected quantitative aspects of recruitment. At increased distances foragers were less likely to recruit, and fewer workers were recruited to the resource area. The amount of nectar affected the tendency of foragers to recruit, but had no effect on the number of ants recruited. Variation in resource distance was also associated with qualitative changes in recruitment strategy. Foragers at distant sites recruited from the canopy rather than from the nest, and often transferred nectar to other workers for transport to the nest. Nectar transfer and extra-nidal recruitment significantly reduced the time required for resource collection. It may also have increased the ability of workers to specialize in specific foraging tasks. A portion of the colony's foraging force specialized spatially by remaining in distant foraging areas without returning to the nest. The flexible recruitment system of P. clavata increases colonial net energetic gain rates by concentrating foraging effort on resources yielding the highest net energetic rewards, and increases the competitive abilities of individual colonies at resource sites by decreasing collection times.","distance effects on resource profitability and recruitment in the giant","We examine how cost and benefit components of resource profitability"

There was no difference between the total weight of prey in singly-provisioned and multiply-provisioned cells: individual caterpillars placed in multiply-provisioned cells were smaller. 3. Small caterpillars were captured and transported to the nest faster than large ones. 4. If the first prey provisioned was large, the cell was usually then permanently closed. If the first prey was small, additional prey were captured, and females appeared to become more selective: additional prey were rarely large. 5. It is suggested that the flexible provisioning strategy used by A. sabulosa allows a wide range of prey sizes to be utilized without affecting maternal control of offspring size and sex. This could be important when available prey sizes vary temporally and spatially. 6. There was a male-biased first generation investment ratio. Female-producing cells were provisioned with a higher total prey weight than male-producing cells, and conversion of prey weight to adult weight was more efficient for females. 7.

However, the impact of short- and long-term temporal resource availability on biodiversity has been less explored. This is highly relevant in tropical agricultural systems for pollinators, as many foraging periods of pollinators extend beyond flowering of any single crop species. In this study, we sought to understand how bee communities in tropical agroecosystems changed between seasons, and if short- and long-term floral resource availability influenced their diversity and abundance. We used a threshold analysis approach in order to explore this relationship at two time scales. This study took place in a region dominated by coffee agroecosystems in Southern Mexico. This was an ideal system because the landscape offers a range of coffee management regimes that maintain heterogeneity in floral resource availability spatially and temporally. We found that the bee community varies significantly between seasons. There were higher abundances of native social, solitary and managed honey bees during the dry season when coffee flowers. Additionally, we found that floral resources from groundcover, but not trees, were associated with bee abundance. Further, the temporal scale of the availability of these resources is important, whereby short-term floral resource availability appears particularly important in maintaining high bee abundance at sites with lower seasonal complementarity. We argue that in addition to spatial resource heterogeneity, temporal resource heterogeneity is critical in explaining bee community patterns, and should thus be considered to promote pollinator conservation. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","floral resource availability from groundcover promotes bee abundance in coffee","Patterns of bee abundance and diversity across different spatial scales"

However, the effects of fungicides on honey bee health have been so far understudied. To assess the effects of some of the top fungicides used during the 2012 California almond bloom on honey bee forager mortality, we collected foragers from a local apiary and exposed them to fungicides (alone and in various combinations) at the label dose, or at doses ranging from 0.25 to 2 times the label dose rate. These fungicides were Iprodione 2SE Select, Pristine, and Quadris.

During their foraging lives, the ants leave their underground colonies for long distances and return to their starting point with fair accuracy [1, 2]. Their incessantly running path integrator provides them with a continually updated home vector [3-5 ]. Directional input to their path integrator is provided by a visual compass based on celestial cues [6, 7]. However, as path integration is prone to cumulative errors, the ants additionally employ landmark guidance routines [8-11]. At the start of their foraging lives, they acquire the necessary landmark information by performing well-structured learning walks [12,13], including turns about their vertical body axes [14]. When Cataglyphis noda performs these pirouettes, it always gazes at the nest entrance during the longest of several short stopping phases [14]. As the small nest entrance is not visible, the ants can adjust their gaze direction only by reading out their path integrator. However, recent experiments have shown that, for adjusting the goal-centered gaze directions during learning walks, skylight cues are not required [15]. A most promising remaining compass cue is the geomagnetic field, which is used for orientation in one way or the other by a variety of animal species [16-25 ]. Here, we show that the gaze directions during the look-back-to-the-nest behavior change in a predictable way to alterations of the horizontal component of the magnetic field. This is the first demonstration that, in insects, a geomagnetic compass cue is both necessary and sufficient for accomplishing a well-defined navigational task.","the geomagnetic field is a compass cue in cataglyphis ant","Desert ants (Cataglyphis) are famous insect navigators.

Thus native plants possess certain traits that make them uniquely adapted to local conditions providing a practical and ecologically valuable alternative for landscaping, conservation and restoration of degraded ecosystems. Mexico's ecosystem is a vast one as the country covers a wide variety of terrains, soils and climates with different geography characteristics which favor the development of native species. For instance, in those arid and semiarid regions of northeastern Mexico there is an extensive native plant list of more than 3,100 species. Regions of the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico are dominated by a dense diversity of native plants. The vascular flora comprises 159 families, 1034 genera, 3181 species and 109 intraspecific taxa. The most diverse families are: Asteraceae (148 genera and 481 species), Poaceae (97 genera and 301 species), Fabaceae (76 genera and 258 species), Cactaceae (37 genera and 139 species) and Euphorbiaceae (15 genera and 85 species) among others. Native plant inventory in northeastern Mexico is mostly composed of deciduous and evergreen or perennial species which are characterized by a wide range of growth patterns, diversity in leaf longevity, dynamics of growth and contrasting phenological developments. This resource is used by the inhabitants of the region in various ways such as forage for livestock, coal, timber, shelving, food, herbal, medicine and seed supply for reforestation and ecological restoration. Additionally, the native plant provides a habitat for wildlife and a cover layer that prevent soil erosion. For these reasons native plants develop various morphological and physiological characteristics suitable for adaptation to adverse environmental factors, particularly drought stress and high temperatures.Numerous vegetal species account for the bulk of the bush vegetation providing a characteristic landscape. The most important of these plants consist of various species of Acacia including A. rigidula, A. farnesiana, A. berlandierii, A. smallii and A. tortuosa, and some other important species such as Prosopis laevigata, P. glandulosa, Leucaena leucocephala, Celtis pallida (desert hackberry), Condalia ericoides (javelina bush), Leucophyllum frutescens (cenizo or sometimes called purple sage), and Aloysia wrightii (common bee-brush or white brush). These species favor the retention of soil due to their high sprouting potential, ease of regeneration after frost and forest fires in addition to being accepted by the people so they may be used successfully to restore degraded areas and initiate programs aimed to the protection and conservation of forest elements in northeastern Mexico. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

If patterns of genetic structure are determined largely by gene flow then they may be useful in predicting the likelihood of inbreeding or outbreeding depression but should be less useful if there is strong site-specific selection. For many Australian plants little is known about either their population genetics or the effects on mating systems of variation in pollen transfer distances. Experimental pollinations were used to compare the reproductive success of bird-adapted Grevillea mucronulata plants mated with individuals from a range of spatial scales. A hierarchical survey of microsatellite DNA variation was also conducted to describe the scale of population differentiation for neutral markers. • Methods: The effects of four pollen treatments on reproductive performance were compared. These treatments were characterized by transfer of pollen from (a) neighbouring adults; (b) an adjacent cluster of adults (30-50 m distant); (c) a distant cluster (&gt;5 km distant); and (d) open pollination. Sets of 17.9 ± 3·3 leaves from each of 15 clusters of plants were genotyped and spatial autocorrelation and F statistics were used to describe patterns of genetic structure. • Key Results: Grevillea mucronulata displayed evidence of both inbreeding and outbreeding depression, with 'intermediate' pollen producing consistently superior outcomes for most aspects of fitness including seed set, seed size, germination and seedling growth. Significant genotypic structuring was detected within clusters (spatial autocorrelation) and among adjacent clusters and clusters separated by &gt;5 km distance (F ST = 0.07 and 0·10). • Conclusions: The superior outcome of intermediate pollen transfer and genetic differentiation of adjacent clusters suggests that G. mucronulata selection disfavours matings among closely and distantly related neighbours. Moreover, the performance of open-pollinated seedlings was poor, implying that current mating patterns are suboptimal. © The Author 2011.

Despite concerns that plants and pollinators might be at risk of such decoupling, there have been few attempts to test this hypothesis using detailed phenological data on insect emergence and flowering at the same localities. In particular, there are few data sets on pollinator flight seasons that are independent of flowering phenology, because pollinators are typically collected at flowers. To address this problem, we established standardized nesting habitat (trap nests) for solitary bees and wasps at sites along an elevational gradient in the Rocky Mountains, and monitored emergence during three growing seasons. We also recorded air temperatures and flowering phenology at each site. Using a reciprocal transplant experiment with nesting bees, we confirmed that local environmental conditions are the primary determinants of emergence phenology. We were then able to develop phenology models to describe timing of pollinator emergence or flowering, across all sites and years, as a function of accumulated degree-days. Although phenology of both plants and insects is well described by thermal models, the best models for insects suggest generally higher threshold temperatures for development or diapause termination than those required for plants. In addition, degree-day requirements for most species, both plants and insects, were lower in locations with longer winters, indicating either a chilling or vernalization requirement that is more completely fulfilled at colder sites, or a critical photoperiod before which degree-day accumulation does not contribute to development. Overall, these results suggest that phenology of plants and trap-nesting bees and wasps is regulated in similar ways by temperature, but that plants are more likely than insects to advance phenology in response to springtime warming. We discuss the implications of these results for plants and pollinators, and suggest that phenological decoupling alone is unlikely to threaten population persistence for most species in our study area.","an examination of synchrony between insect emergence and flowering in","One possible effect of climate change is the generation of"

Habitat destruction and fragmentation associated with urbanization are reported as part of the main causes of this decline. Urbanization involves dramatic changes of the landscape, increasing the proportion of impervious surface while decreasing that of green areas. Few studies have investigated the effects of urbanization on bee communities. We assessed changes in the abundance, species richness, and composition of wild bee community along an urbanization gradient. Methodology/Principal Findings: Over two years and on a monthly basis, bees were sampled with colored pan traps and insect nets at 24 sites located along an urbanization gradient. Landscape structure within three different radii was measured at each study site. We captured 291 wild bee species. The abundance of wild bees was negatively correlated with the proportion of impervious surface, while species richness reached a maximum at an intermediate (50%) proportion of impervious surface. The structure of the community changed along the urbanization gradient with more parasitic species in sites with an intermediate proportion of impervious surface. There were also greater numbers of cavity-nesting species and long-tongued species in sites with intermediate or higher proportion of impervious surface. However, urbanization had no effect on the occurrence of species depending on their social behavior or body size. Conclusions/Significance: We found nearly a third of the wild bee fauna known from France in our study sites. Indeed, urban areas supported a diverse bee community, but sites with an intermediate level of urbanization were the most speciose ones, including greater proportion of parasitic species. The presence of a diverse array of bee species even in the most urbanized area makes these pollinators worthy of being a flagship group to raise the awareness of urban citizens about biodiversity.","decreasing abundance, increasing diversity and changing structure of the wild","Background: Wild bees are important pollinators that have declined in"

The diverse Madagascan millipede assassin bugs (Heteroptera: Reduviidae: Ectrichodiinae) offer an opportunity to contribute to a limited body of insect-related research that explores Madagascar's historical biogeography. A molecular dataset (COI mtDNA and 18S, 28S D2 and D3-D5 rDNAs) for 56 taxa (39 ingroup) and a combined morphological (145 characters) and molecular dataset for 110 taxa (93 ingroup) are analyzed with maximum likelihood (ML) and parsimony approaches. Based on the molecular ML phylogeny, divergence times were estimated using fossil and secondary calibrations and biogeographic analyses performed using DIVA, DEC, and DEC + j models to determine the role and patterns of vicariance and dispersal in the origin of Madagascan Ectrichodiinae. Results indicate that Ectrichodiinae in Madagascar do not form a monophyletic group, different clades are closely related to Afrotropical and Oriental lineages, and have colonized the island via transoceanic dispersal at least twice from the Oriental region and once from the Afrotropical region in the last similar to 68 my. Additionally, the DEC + j and DIVA models infer a single out-of-Madagascar dispersal event to the Afrotropical region. Oceanic and geologic factors that may have facilitated dispersal between these three regions are discussed. Results of the combined analyses are used to explore character support for Madagascan taxa and inform taxonomic diagnoses. Our results are congruent with the small but growing body of biogeographic research supporting Cenozoic transoceanic dispersal for Madagascan invertebrates to and from Oriental and Afrotropical regions.

The western honeybee, Apis mellifera, has been introduced to many parts of the world and is sometimes purported to be detrimental to native bees because it reduces their food base. It is seldom viewed in this light in Europe; however, when beekeepers maintain very high bee densities, the species could also be displacing insects in its native European range by reducing the resource base. 2. In England, populations of bumblebees (Bombus Latr. Hym.) have been decreasing both in terms of diversity and abundance, mainly because of a loss of habitat resulting from agricultural intensification. The impact of competition from other flower feeders is largely unknown. 3. Nineteen dry lowland heaths in southern England were sampled once for honeybees and bumblebees. Honeybee abundance varied from 4 to 81 bees per 100 m2 (mean = 30.89, median = 23), whereas bumblebees varied from 2 to 17 individuals per 100 m2 (mean = 8.26, median = 7), belonging to between one and five species. There was a negative association between honeybee and bumblebee abundance but there was no apparent relationship between honeybee abundance and bumblebee diversity. 4. The Bray-Curtis coefficient was used to compare the similarity in honeybee and bumblebee floral host breadth at these 19 sites. The coefficient was negatively associated with honeybee abundance: thus where honeybees were most abundant, bumblebees were fewer and/or foraged on different flower species. 5. Foraging host breadth was also examined at four heathlands over a field season (April to September). No association between honeybee abundance and foraging host breadth was found for short-tongued bees, although there was some evidence for a change in floral host breadth for long-tongued bees. 6. It is concluded that the impact of honeybees on bumblebees is complex. Although competition between the two species cannot be ruled out, it is perhaps equally likely that bumblebees decline in response to other factors, and that honeybees move independently of this decline.","the relationship between the abundance of bumblebees and honeybees in","1.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of landscape context at multiple spatial scales on the abundance of bee pollinators of tomato crops in Brazil. Pollinator abundance was obtained from tomato crops grown in a conventional system in the Cerrado region. Around each tomato field circular buffers of 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 km radius were defined. Inside each buffer the landscapes were manually classified into native and non-native cover and, the proportion of native vegetation, the relative largest patch size, and the distance of the nearest native vegetation to each field were calculated. Pollinator species were categorized into five groups: Exomalopsis, Centris, Bombus/Eulaema, Halictidae, and all buzz pollinators combined (Buzzers). The results showed that the landscape context influenced the abundance of the five groups of tomato pollinators. Bees with a smaller body size, such as Exomalopsis spp., responded at smaller scales, while bees with a larger body size, such as the Centris and Bombus/Eulaema groups, responded at larger scales. The abundance of all pollinator groups increased with native vegetation cover. Most groups showed higher abundances in landscapes with similar-size fragments. The results reinforce the recommendation for maintaining natural habitats around crop areas, even if fragmented, for the conservation of the tomato pollinator assemblage. These findings are valuable for planning landscape management in the studied area to improve bee conservation, ecosystem services, and food production.","influence of landscape context on the abundance of native bee","Evidence shows that pollinator abundance has declined and, consequently, so"

Vellozia epidendroides is short, grows on pebbly or sandy soil, and is pollinated by bees. Vellozia leptopetala is arborescent, grows on rock outcrops, and is pollinated by bees and hummingbirds. Both are self-incompatible and have a short, massive flowering strategy. The study aimed to associate differences in their genetic diversity and structure with their microhabitat distribution and pollination ecology. center dot Methods Leaves from 106 and 139 plants of V. epidendroides and V. leptopetala, respectively, were collected from five patches of each species and prepared for electrophoretic analyses. center dot Key Results Five enzyme systems could be reliably scored for both species. Vellozia epidendroides showed 100 % of the loci polymorphic for almost all patches. The average number of alleles per locus ranged between 2.2 and 2.4 among patches. The Wright's fixation index (F) for this species was 0.226. A significant theta(p) value indicates that there is a reasonable genetic divergence among patches. Vellozia leptopetala presented 47.5 % of polymorphic loci. All levels of P, A, A(p) and of heterozygosities were lower than those of V. epidendroides. Vellozia leptopetala showed high inbreeding within patches. center dot Conclusions The relatively high values of genetic diversity indices found for V. epidendroides may be associated with its large and widespread populations. On the other hand, the low values of genetic diversity found for V. leptopetala may be related to physical isolation on outcrops and intensive foraging by territorial hummingbirds, which may hinder gene flow among patches, aggravated by the very restricted seed dispersal characteristic of the genus, that facilitates sibling mating. It is important to stress the need to preserve the specific habitats of these species of Vellozia, in particular those of V. leptopetala that has lower genetic diversity and is restricted to rock outcrop environments.","the genetic diversity of two brazilian vellozia (velloziaceae) with different","center dot Background and Aims The genetic structure and variability"

The concept of reconciliation ecology, by which the anthropogenic environment may be modified to encourage non-human use and biodiversity preservation without compromising societal utilization, potentially represents an appropriate paradigm for urban conservation given the generally poor opportunities that exist for reserve establishment and ecological restoration in urban areas. Two habitat improvement techniques with great potential for reconciliation ecology in urban areas are the installation of living roofs and walls, which have been shown to support a range of taxa at local scales. This paper evaluates the reconciliation potential of living roofs and walls, in particular highlighting both ecological and societal limitations that need to be overcome for application at the landscape scale. We further consider that successful utilization of living roofs and walls for urban reconciliation ecology will rely heavily on the participation of urban citizens, and that a 'citizen science' model is needed to facilitate public participation and support and to create an evidence base to determine their effectiveness.

This species swarms frequently and is extremely successful in urban environments. In addition, it is one of the most popular stingless bee species for beekeeping in Latin America, so nest transportation and trading is common. Nest transportation can change the genetic structure of the host population, reducing inbreeding and increasing homogenization. Here, we evaluate the genetic structure of 17 geographic populations of T. angustula in southern Brazil to quantify the level of genetic differentiation between populations. Analyses were conducted on partially sequenced mitochondrial genes and 11 microsatellite loci of 1002 workers from 457 sites distributed on the mainland and on 3 islands. Our results show that T. angustula populations are highly differentiated as demonstrated by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite markers. Of 73 haplotypes, 67 were population-specific. MtDNA diversity was low in 9 populations but microsatellite diversity was moderate to high in all populations. Microsatellite data suggest 10 genetic clusters and low level of gene flow throughout the studied area. However, physical barriers, such as rivers and mountain ranges, or the presence or absence of forest appear to be unrelated to population clusters. Factors such as low dispersal, different ecological conditions, and isolation by distance are most likely shaping the population structure of this species. Thus far, nest transportation has not influenced the general population structure in the studied area. However, due to the genetic structure we found, we recommend that nest transportation should only occur within and between populations that are genetically similar. © 2016 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","population structuring of the ubiquitous stingless bee tetragonisca angustula in","Tetragonisca angustula is one of the most widespread stingless bees"

The total niche overlap was 0.27 although there were large variation among the different months (0.09 to 0.50), demonstrating that there were periods when niche overlap intensified between the introduced honey bees and the native bumblebees. Data on plant phenology in the region of the Chapada Diamantina Mountain Range indicated that our sampling occurred principally during the months of generally greater abundance of floral resources for insect visitors, and that this may have been one of the factors that contributed to the low overlap levels encountered during most months. Sampling to cover the months and years with low availability of floral resources would complement our understanding of the effects of intensification of niche overlap and could better help in evaluating the effects of the presence of Apis mellifera on the foraging of B. atratus in this habitat.","plant use and niche overlap between the introduced honey bee","The present study analyzed plant use by Apis mellifera and"

In the last years this phenomenon has become increasingly serious, and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain honey bee and colony losses. These hypotheses relate to pests and diseases, pesticides, apicultural practices, climate change, electromagnetic fields, GMO crops, etc. Honey bee colony losses are being surveyed in several European countries, but these surveys are not sufficiently structured. Based on beekeepers' reports, honey bee losses in Italy follow a clear seasonal pattern: a) during spring and summer colonies lose many foragers due to agrochemicals (bee losses); b) from late summer to winter, the impact of pests (including Varroa) and pathogens becomes more important (colony losses). To assess the extent and investigate the possible causes of honey bee and colony losses in Italy a national monitoring network needs to be established. Target apiaries will be distributed in selected-sites (modules), ideally one per region to cover the national territory. Each module, composed of five apiaries- with ten non-migratory colonies each, will be chosen based on environmental characteristics with a distance tojhe center of the module of about 50 km. Colonies will be visually inspected four times a year (right after winter, spring, summer and just before winter).-In each inspection several parameters of each colony will- be'considered-health and nutritional condition, number of bees and brood, and queen's age. The person in charge of each module will input the information obtained in a real-time database available on the Internet. In addition, dead and live bees, as well as several beehive matrices (brood, pollen, wax) will be collected during each inspection for chemical, pollen and disease analyses. The information collected through this honey-bee monitoring network will provide a broad database from which to explore patterns of disease, toxic exposure and management practices that may be linked to the occurrence of honey bee and colony losses.

Differences in dispersion capacity, which is greater in B. morio, likely influence their phylogeographic patterns. This study asks which processes best explain the patterns of genetic variation observed in B. morio and B. pauloensis, shedding light on the phenomena that shaped the range of local populations and the spatial distribution of intra-specific lineages. Results: Results suggest that Pleistocene climatic oscillations directly influenced the population structure of both species. Correlative species distribution models predict that the warmer conditions of the Last Interglacial contributed to population contraction, while demographic expansion happened during the Last Glacial Maximum. These results are consistent with physiological data suggesting that bumblebees are well adapted to colder conditions. Intra-specific mitochondrial genealogies are not congruent between the two species, which may be explained by their documented differences in dispersal ability. Conclusions: While populations of the high-dispersal B. morio are morphologically and genetically homogeneous across the species range, B. pauloensis encompasses multiple (three) mitochondrial lineages, and show clear genetic, geographic, and morphological differences. Because the lineages of B. pauloensis are currently exposed to distinct climatic conditions (and elevations), parapatric diversification may occur within this taxon.

However, individual decision making can also play an important role, depending on the type of foraging behaviour. In the termite-hunting ant species Megaponera analis information about foraging sites is collected by only a handful of individual scouts that have to convey this information to the colony as accurately as possible to optimize their foraging behaviour. We therefore looked at predictions made by optimal foraging theory to better understand the interplay between collective and individual decision making in this obligate group-raiding predator. We found a clear positive relation between raid size (200-500 ants) and termite abundance at the foraging site thereby confirming predictions of the maximization of energy theory. Furthermore, selectivity of the food source increased with distance, thus confirming central place prediction theory. The confirmation of these theories suggests that individual scouts must be the main driver behind raid size, choice and raiding behaviour. The marginal value theorem was also confirmed by our results: time spent at the hunting ground increased with distance and prey quantity. This raises questions on how foraging time at the food source is regulated in a group-hunting predator. Hunger decreased selectivity of scouts with respect to food sources, while average raid size increased and more scouts left the nest in search of prey, thus implying that scouts are aware of the hunger state of the colony and adapt their decision making accordingly. Remarkably, most central place foraging behaviours in M. analis were not achieved by collective decisions but rather by individual decisions of scout ants. Thus, 1% of the colony (10-20 scouts) decided the fate and foraging efficiency of the remaining 99%. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Sci. 77, 138-145). We describe a detailed experimental and mathematical analysis of information exchange and decision-making in, arguably, the most difficult collective choices that social insects face: namely, house hunting by complete societies. The key issue is how can a complete colony select the single best nest-site among several alternatives? Individual scouts respond to the diverse information they have personally obtained about the quality of a potential nest-site by producing a recruitment signal. The colony then deliberates over (i.e. integrates) different incoming recruitment signals associated with different potential nest-sites to achieve a well-informed collective decision. We compare this process in honeybees and in the ant Leptothorax albipennis. Notwithstanding many differences - for example, honeybee colonies have 100 times more individuals than L. albipennis colonies - there are certain similarities in the fundamental algorithms these societies appear to employ when they are house hunting. Scout honeybees use the full power of the waggle dance to inform their nest-mates about the distance and direction of a potential nest-site (and they indicate the quality of a nest-site indirectly through the vigour of their dance), and yet individual bees perhaps only rarely make direct comparisons of such sites. By contrast, scouts from L. albipennis colonies often compare nest-sites, but they cannot directly inform one another of their estimation of the quality of a potential site. Instead, they discriminate between sites by initiating recruitment sooner to better ones. Nevertheless, both species do make use of forms of opinion polling. For example, scout bees that have formerly danced for a certain site cease such advertising and monitor the dances of others at random. That is, they act without prejudice. They neither favour nor disdain dancers that advocate the site they had formerly advertised or the alternatives. Thus, in general the bees are less well informed than they would be if they systematically monitored dances for alternative sites rather than spending their time reprocessing information they already have. However, as a result of their lack of prejudice, less time overall will be wasted in endless debate among stubborn and potentially biased bees. Among the ants, the opinions of nest-mates are also pooled effectively when scouts use a threshold population of their nest-mates present in a new nest-site as a cue to switch to more rapid recruitment. Furthermore, the ants' reluctance to begin recruiting to poor nest-sites means that more time is available for the discovery and direct comparison of alternatives. Likewise, the retirement of honeybee scouts from dancing for a given site allows more time for other scouts to find potentially better sites. Thus, both the ants and the bees have time-lags built into their decision-making systems that should facilitate a compromise between thorough surveys for good nest-sites and relatively rapid decisions. We have also been able to show that classical mathematical models can illuminate the processes by which colonies are able to achieve decisions that are relatively swift and very well informed.","information flow, opinion polling and collective intelligence in house-hunting social","The sharing and collective processing of information by certain insect"

We show that most existing approaches to scene-based homing implicitly assume an isotropic landmark distribution. As an alternative, we propose a homing scheme that uses parameterized displacement fields. These are obtained from an approximation that incorporates prior knowledge about perspective distortions of the visual environment. A mathematical analysis proves that both approximations do not prevent the schemes from approaching the goal with arbitrary accuracy, but lead to different errors in the computed goal direction. Mobile robot experiments are used to test the theoretical predictions and to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the new approach.","where did i take that snapshot? scene-based homing by image","In homing tasks, the goal is often not marked by"

We also tested the foragers' memories of one skyline at several time points after the skyline was replaced by a different one. During retention testing, foragers appear able to retain robust memories of these skylines over periods (5 days) that surpass their average life span. Exposure to the nest panorama during these periods did not interfere with navigational performance at the distant skyline. Foragers in the replacement experiment initially oriented correctly to both skylines. Thereafter, the foragers' headings in tests with the first skyline gradually shifted away from the correct homeward direction.

Comparison was made among two bee species, Apis mellifera and Centris tarsata, in their pollination of cashew flowers using a number of measures including single bee visits to marked flowers. 2. Cashew flowering is protandrous within a day. Male flowers greatly outnumber hermaphrodite flowers. Stigmas lose receptivity rapidly and pollen is quickly removed from anthers yet flowers remain intact for several days. 3. Only females of C. tarsata collected pollen from cashew flowers, and then only from male flowers. The similar foraging behaviour of the nectar collectors of the two bee species under investigation when visiting hermaphrodite cashew flowers suggests that they may both act as good pollinators. 4. We develop an index of efficiency of pollen removal from anthers (PREi) whereby the relative benefits of flower visitors to a component of a plant's male reproductive success can be quantified. 5. Comparisons of single bee visits to flowers with unvisited flowers and others receiving unlimited visits were used to show that: C. tarsata pollen collectors were more efficient than nectar collectors of either bee species at removing pollen from anthers; nectar collectors of both bee species had similar pollen removal efficiencies; C. tarsata was more efficient at depositing pollen on stigmas than A. mellifera; both bee species had statistically similar efficiencies at setting seed. 6. The indices of efficiency for some of the stages in the pollination of cashew suggest that C. tarsata flower visits may enhance plant reproductive success over flower visits by A. mellifera but that both bee species may be suitable for the pollination of commercially grown cashew. 7. Despite cashew's single ovule per flower, high nut set demands a high rate of pollinator visitation during the peak time of stigma receptivity.

But contact with a dancing bee is much more effective. When two groups of bees from the same colony have visited two scentless feeding places one of which is close to the hive and the other further away, and one place is resupplied with food after a break in feeding at both, the contact with a dancer indicating the accustomed feeding site is much more effective than contact with a strange dancer indicating the unfamiliar location. The same can be observed if the two places are at equal distance but lie at 100 ° to each other. Under natural conditions foraging groups of the same colony usually exploit food sources with different scents simultaneously. If the profitability of one food source decreases, the intensity of the dances in favour of this place also declines. Members of the group can be induced to visit a better source by more intense dances of another group. So the whole collecting activity of a colony can be adapted to the changing conditions. In the same way scout bees perform their dances on the swarm, having explored different potential nest sites; the better the site the more intense the dance. This results finally in all groups that initially advertised different goals agreeing on the best site. © 1968.","the role of dances in recruiting bees to familiar sites","Forager bees remaining inactive on the comb when their food"

Yet, not all species are mobile enough to perform sufficient dispersal. Such passive dispersers may use more mobile animals as dispersal vectors. If multiple potential vectors are available, an active choice can allow to optimize the dispersal process and to determine the distribution of dispersal distances, i.e. an optimal dispersal kernel. We explore dispersal and vector choice in the neotropical flower mite Spadiseius calyptrogynae using a dual approach which combines experiments with an individual-based simulation model. Spadiseius calyptrogynae is found in lowland rainforests in Costa Rica. It inhabits inflorescences of the understorey palm Calyptrogyne ghiesbreghtiana and is phoretic on a number of flower visitors including bats, beetles and stingless bees. We hypothesised that the mites should optimise their dispersal kernel by actively choosing a specific mix of potential phoretic vectors. In a simple olfactometer setup we showed that the flower mites do indeed discriminate between potential vectors. Subsequently we used an individual-based model to analyse the evolutionary forces responsible for the observed patterns of vector choice. The mites combine vectors exhibiting long-distance dispersal with those allowing for more localized dispersal. This results in a fat-tailed dispersal kernel that guarantees the occasional colonization of new host plant patches (long distance) while optimizing the exploitation of clumped resources (local dispersal). Additionally, kin competition results in a preference for small vectors that transport only few individuals at a time. At the same time, these vectors lead to directed dispersal towards suitable habitat, which increases the stability of this very specialized interaction. Our findings can be applied to other phoretic systems but also to vector-based seed dispersal, for example. © 2013 The Authors.","picky hitch-hikers: vector choice leads to directed dispersal and fat-tailed","Dispersal is a central life-history trait for most animals and"

The locomotor rhythm in foragers of the Japanese honeybee, Apis cerana japonica, was entrained to a skeleton temperature cycle. An initial warm temperature pulse was imposed at the beginning of subjective day and a second was applied at the end of the subjective day. A single warm pulse given every early subjective day in constant darkness (DD) entrained the locomotor rhythm without a second temperature pulse, but a single pulse given in late subjective day allowed a free-running rhythm. When honeybees were kept under a light-dark cycle, their body temperatures increased by 7-8 °C with locomotor activity. This temperature elevation remained during the photophase but followed the ambient environmental temperature at night. Body temperature oscillations continued to be circadian in DD, and temperature elevation occurred during the subjective day. In DD, the free-running period τ of locomotor activity increased when the ambient temperature increased from 27 to 37 °C, although these changes were within the range of temperature compensation for many organisms. Under continuous light conditions (LL), τ remained constant with more strict temperature compensation. Patterns of brain period mRNA levels of forager bees maintained at different temperatures in LL revealed that the free-running period of per mRNA rhythm was temperature compensated. In addition, temperature strongly influenced the amplitude of the circadian transcriptional rhythms during the free-run period in LL, which may confer temperature compensation.

In recent years the production of the Styrian oil pumpkin listed severe losses, one of the reasons is a decreased availability of pollinators. Since a great loss of bee colonies (decrease of about 200.000 beehives in the last ten years) and wild bees can be observed in Austria and worldwide, an adequate pollination cannot be guaranteed any longer. Strategies to find alternative pollinators and to ensure sufficient pollination are important. In this study we determined the pollination efficiency of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) compared to honeybees (Apis mellifera). Further we investigated the pollination behaviour (flower visit rate, visit frequency and forage distances) of bumblebees in the open field, to see if they can be used as an alternative, if honeybee colonies continue to decline, or honeybee pollination alone is not sufficient, for example at adverse weather. These studies of bumblebees in Cucurbita fields are the first ones in Austria, as up to now bumblebees were only used in glasshouses or orchards. Our studies showed that bumblebees can be used in the open field and can lead to a general improvement in pollination, as bumblebees visited four to five times more flowers in a minute and foraged at adverse weather, even during rain. But the use of commercial bumblebees in Styrian pumpkin fields, as already used in tomato or pepper greenhouses, can not be a solution for the pollination problems as at least four to five hives / hectare are needed. They can only be an alternative if the natural populations can be increased again, this means habitat and food resources must be conserved.","pollination problems in styrian oil pumpkin plants: can bumblebees be","The Styrian oil pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L. subsp. pepo var."

We divided the landscape elements of the study area into three types: deciduous forest, conifer plantation and open land according to landcover digital data, and each pollen taxon was assigned to one of these three types of landscape elements. We collected total pollen loads of 15.75 g (total of colonies A and B) in May (spring), 1.57g ( total of colonies A and C) in June (early summer), 19.03 g (total of colonies A, B and C) in July (mid-summer) and 45.61 g (total of colonies A, B and D) in September (autumn). Deciduous forests are the most important foraging habitats for A. cerana japonica in the ""Satoyama"" landscape especially from spring to mid-summer when mass flowering of tall trees and shrubs species provides rich floral resources for developing bee colonies. On the other hand, the bees frequently foraged from herbaceous plant species in autumn when flowering of tree species reduces and herbaceous plant species have flowering peaks.

We re-examine the phylogeny of this genus, using an expanded set of taxa from Madagascar and Malawi and additional sequence data, in order to determine the number of dispersals and the timeframe over which they occurred. Location: Africa, Madagascar, Malawi, Asia and Australia. Methods: One nuclear (EF-1α F2) and two mitochondrial (CO1 and Cyt b) gene regions were sequenced for 36 allodapine bee species (including members of the genera Braunsapis, Nasutapis, Allodape, Allodapula, and Macrogalea) and one ceratinine species (Ceratina japonica). We used Bayesian analyses to examine phylogenetic structure and a penalized likelihood approach to estimate approximate ages for key divergences in our phylogeny. Results: Our analyses indicate a tropical African origin for Braunsapis in the early Miocene followed by very early dispersal into Asia and then a subsequent dispersal, following Asian diversification, into Australia during the late Miocene. There have also been two dispersals of Braunsapis from Africa to Madagascar and this result, when combined with phylogenetic and biogeographical data for other allodapines, suggests that these bees have the ability to cross moderately large ocean expanses. These dispersals may have been aided by the West Wind Drift, but rafting across the Mozambique Channel is also possible, and could be aided by the existence of developmental stages that require minimal or no feeding and by tolerance to sea water and spume. Accumulating evidence suggests that many biogeographical patterns in the southern hemisphere may be better explained by dispersal than by Gondwanan vicariance hypotheses. Our results add to this growing body of data and raise the possibility that some puzzling trans-Indian Ocean distributions may also be explained by historical dispersal events across oceanic barriers that now seem insuperable. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","phylogenetics of the allodapine bee genus braunsapis: historical biogeography and","Aim: A previous study of the allodapine bee genus Braunsapis"

Under natural conditions flowers were visited by four different animal species including a robber-like pollinator and a secondary robber. Natural levels of nectar robbing ranged from 40 to 100%. Natural variation in nectar robbing was not associated with fruit set in any year whereas seed set was weakly positively associated for 1year only. Artificial nectar robbing did not increase nectar production or concentration, did not affect the behavior of long-billed hummingbirds, and when faced with artificially robbed flowers, these visitors behaved as secondary nectar robbers. The number of stigmas within a patch that received pollen dye analogs and the average distance traveled by these analogs were not significantly different between robbing treatments (robbed flowers versus unrobbed flowers), but the maximum distance traveled by these pollen analogs was higher when nectar robbing was not prevented. Overall, the proportion of robbed flowers on an inflorescence had a neutral effect to a weak positive effect on the reproduction of individual plants (i.e. positive association between nectar robbing and fruit set in 2002) even when it clearly changed the behavior of its most efficient pollinator potentially increasing the frequency of nectar robbing within a plant.","effects of nectar robbing on pollinator behavior and plant reproductive","Nectar robbers may have direct and indirect effects on plant"

Pollinators provide a foundation for ecological communities by assisting in the reproduction of native plants, yet our understanding of how pollinators such as wild bees respond to variation in fire severity is limited, particularly for forest ecosystems. Here, we took advantage of a natural experiment created by a large-scale, mixed-severity wildfire to provide the first assessment of how wild bee communities are shaped by fire severity in mixed-conifer forest. We sampled bees in the Douglas Fire Complex, a 19,000-ha fire in southern Oregon, USA, to evaluate how bee communities responded to local-scale fire severity. We found that fire severity served a strong driver of bee diversity: 20 times more individuals and 11 times more species were captured in areas that experienced high fire severity relative to areas with the lowest fire severity. In addition, we found pronounced seasonality in the local bee community, with more individuals and more species captured during late summer, especially in severely burned regions of the landscape. Two critical habitat components for maintaining bee populations—flowering plants and boring insect exit holes used by cavity-nesting bees—also increased with fire severity. Although we detected shifts in the relative abundance of several bee and plant genera along the fire severity gradient, the two most abundant bee genera (Bombus and Halictus) responded positively to high fire severity despite differences in their typical foraging ranges. Our study demonstrates that within a large wildfire mosaic, severely burned forest contained the most diverse wild bee communities.

Foraging routes of worker and queen bumble bees (Bombus kirbyellus Curtis) collecting nectar from flowers of the alpine sky pilot, Polemonium viscosum Nutt., were followed and the corolla tube length, corolla diameter, floral scent, and number of flowers on plants visited or bypassed by bees were monitored. Additionally, the number and proportion of flowers visited per inflorescence and distance flown from each to the next were recorded. Queens and workers differed significantly in choice of flowers. However, intra‐inflorescence visitation rates and departure distances were similar between castes. Castes differed in the extent to which visitation reflected patch quality versus individual floral traits. Both queens and workers failed to visit skunky‐flowered plants more often than they failed to visit sweet‐flowered ones, and preferred large over small inflorescences. However, queens visited large‐flowered plants more often than small‐flowered ones, while workers preferred flowers with shorter corolla tubes, regardless of their diameter. Although a number of studies have documented caste specialization on alternate species of host plants, ours is one of the first to show that morphological preferences promote comparable foraging differences between castes on monospecific plant resources. Queens, once on a plant, responded to floral traits by probing more flowers on large inflorescences, as well as on those with broader floral form. Workers did not alter intra‐inflorescence visitation rate in response to floral traits. For workers, no significant relationship was demonstrated between the likelihood of passing by a plant and the number of flowers probed on the previous inflorescence visited. Thus, workers appeared to accept or reject each plant of P. viscosum independently. However, queens passed by fewer plants when leaving rich inflorescences than poor ones. These results suggest that workers use only individual plant acceptability in choosing which plants to visit, whereas queens base plant choice on patch and individual attributes. Such differences between castes in foraging rules when exploiting the same floral resource have received little attention, and provide insights into the heterogeneity of harvestable reward distributions from the perspective of the forager population.

Number of bee-eater colonies increased with number of food sources (hives and apiaries); conversely total bird population and colony size were not related to food sources. Bee-eaters preyed on bees (foragers) in relation to their mean total availability (calculated over all study areas), but predation on bees occurred also where hives were absent or far away. By contrast, predation on drones was negatively correlated to their mean total availability. Indeed, predation on foragers and drones correlated negatively. Predation impact on foragers was on average 0.37% (range: 0.26-0.58%) of their mean total availability during May-July. The daily forager mortality per hive due to bee-eater predation represented on average 6.1% (n = 73) of their total daily mortality per hive. Predation pressure on drones was on average 0.91% (range: 0.27-1.43%) of their mean total availability during May-July. The daily drone mortality per hive due to bee-eater predation represented on average 30% (n = 4) of their total daily mortality per hive. Predation impact by bee-eaters on foragers was independent from prey density. Conversely, predation on drones was inversely dependent from prey density, thus it was diluted at high hive densities. The economic impact on apiculture by bee-eaters was in general negligible, but losses of drones were locally important and potentially detrimental to small or specialized apicultures.","estimating predation impact on honeybees apis mellifera l. by european","We studied predation pressure on honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) by"

Here, we present a working protocol based on infrared thermography to estimate both cold and heat thermal stress in insects. We analyse both the change in the body temperature of individuals and their behavioural response. In addition, we used partial least squares regression for the statistical analysis of our data, a technique that solves the problem of having a large number of variables and few individuals, allowing us to work with rare or endemic species. To test our protocol, we chose two species of congeneric, narrowly distributed dung beetles that are endemic to the southeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.

With this methodology we discriminate between the two flightless species of Jekelius through their thermal response. In response to cold, Jekelius hernandezi showed a higher rate of cooling and reached higher temperatures of stupor and haemolymph freezing than Jekelius punctatolineatus.

Alternatively, a larger display may reduce fitness by increasing pollen movement within an individual. In dichogamous species the frequency of this geitonogamy also depends on floral gender ratio and pollinator response to floral gender and to inflorescence architecture. We explored the relationships of floral display size and dichogamy to potential geitonogamy in Campanula americana, a protandrous herb. We observed pollinators in a natural population, in which individuals differed in display size, gender ratio, and distance to conspecifics, and in experimental arrays, in which individuals differed only in display size. In both settings, bees responded to increased floral displays by increasing the number and length of foraging bouts. The number of potentially geitonogamous visits, those to female-phase flowers after male-phase flowers, also increased with display size. In addition, although proportion of flowers visited did not increase with the floral display, the proportion of geitonogamous visits did. There was no evidence that dichogamy reduced the potential for geitonogamy. The ratio of male- to female-phase flowers did not affect bee behavior, and bees did not display a gender preference. In contrast to other studies, the presentation of female-phase flowers below male-phase flowers on reproductive branches did not reduce geitonogamy. Variation in floral display size may cause the mating system to vary among populations. We found that display size varied among 12 populations and that geitonogamy may be infrequent in many populations as a result of small display sizes. Finally, within populations, the selfing rates of larger biennial C. americana are likely to exceed those of smaller annual individuals.","the contribution of display size and dichogamy to potential geitonogamy","An increase in floral display size may enhance fitness by"

The study area was representative of the UK agricultural landscape in that the percentage area cover of the blooming oilseed rape fields around the rural location was similar to the national average (3.3-3.9% vs 3.1%). The amount of foraging on oilseed rape fields, as indicated by dance decoding, was variable, but low, 0-0.02% for the urban and 2-26% for the rural location. Almost all foraging, 91-99%, was within 2. km, even though honey bees can forage at distances of over 10. km. Pollen trapping in 2012 supported the dance decoding results, with oilseed rape pollen comprising 14% of pollen pellets collected by foragers from rural and 4% from urban hives. The results of this study have implications for policy as they cast doubt on the generality of some previous studies on colony-level effects on social bees conducted in laboratory and semi-field settings. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","honey bee dance decoding and pollen-load analysis show limited foraging","Neonicotinoid insecticides used to treat the seeds of bee-attractive crops"

Here, we investigate the effects of patch size on insect visitation in patches of smaller area (range c. 0.1-3.1m2), which are of particular relevance to ornamental flower beds in parks and gardens. We studied two common garden plant species in full bloom with 6 patch sizes each: borage (Borago officinalis) and lavender (Lavandula×intermedia 'Grosso'). We quantified flower visitation by insects by making repeated counts of the insects foraging at each patch. On borage, all insects were honey bees (Apis mellifera, n=5506 counts). On lavender, insects (n=737 counts) were bumble bees (Bombus spp., 76.9%), flies (Diptera, 22.4%), and butterflies (Lepidoptera, 0.7%). On both plant species we found positive linear effects of patch size on insect numbers. However, there was no effect of patch size on the number of insects per unit area or per flower and, on lavender, for all insects combined or only bumble bees.

Urban habitats often support considerable biodiversity and so are of conservation value, even though they are highly modified ecosystems. Urban parks and gardens are rich in flowers that provide food for pollinators, including bees. Here, we use waggle dance decoding to investigate foraging by 3 honey bee hives located in the city of Brighton, UK, over almost an entire foraging season, April to October. Waggle dances were recorded using video cameras and decoded during framewise playback on a computer by measuring the angle and duration of the waggle phase. Foraging was mostly local (mean monthly distances 0.5–1.2 km) and mostly within the surrounding urban area (monthly means 78–92 %) versus the countryside (closest distance 2.2 km) even though this was well within the honey bee maximum foraging range (c. 12 km). These distances were lower than those from a previous study for hives located in a rural area 4.5 km away. Honey bees are very sensitive to foraging economics and foragers make waggle dances only after visiting high-quality feeding locations. Low distances advertised by dances, therefore, indicate sufficient forage nearby and show that urban areas can support honey bees year round. As a corollary, however, urban bees may provide little pollination service to agriculture especially in spring, which had the lowest foraging distances and is when the most economically important animal-pollinated UK crops, apple and oilseed rape, are in bloom. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","eating locally: dance decoding demonstrates that urban honey bees in","Urbanization is increasing worldwide.

We counted and identified insects as they foraged on flowers in 228 varieties growing in discrete patches that flowered during the survey period, 14 September-20 October 2012. In each variety, we also determined the overall capitulum size, the central disc floret area, and the ray floret color (blue, red, purple, or white). We also scored attributes relevant to gardening: attractiveness to humans, ease of cultivation, and availability in the United Kingdom. There was great variation among varieties in their attractiveness to insects, ranging from 0.0 to 15.2 per count per square meter, and highly skewed, with most being unattractive. A similar skew held for the two main insect categories, honey bees and hover flies, which comprised 28 and 64% of all insects, respectively. None of the floral traits or attributes relevant to gardening correlated significantly with attractiveness to insects. Our study shows the practicality of using a national collection for quantifying and comparing the attractiveness of ornamental varieties to flower-visiting insects.

Honeybees and bumblebees are 2 closely related hymenopteran species for which precise data on photoreceptor sensitivities and receptor noise exist, enabling accurate testing on how their vision conforms to model predictions. Color vision has been proved in these species, and they are known to predominantly visit flowers using visual signals to collect nutrition. Surprisingly, however, the natural variability of flower signals has been rarely considered, and recent work also suggests bees may tune color vision through experience. We initially measured the spectral variability of flowers from 2 species: Goodenia ovata and Rosemarinus officinalis where free-flying honeybees were observed constantly foraging from conspecific flowers. We empirically determined honeybee color discrimination thresholds for color stimuli considering either absolute- or differential- conditioning discrimination functions. Secondly, we analyzed greenhouse grown wild-type Antirrhinum majus flower petal spectra as well as spectra from mixta and nivea strains of this species, and empirically determined bumblebee color discrimination considering conditioning experience. In all measured cases, within-flower type spectral variability exceeded a 1.0 Receptor Noise threshold, often by several units. Observed behavioral color discrimination functions considering the respective conditioning procedures closely matched the range of signal variability for both honeybees and bumblebees, showing that color vision in bees cannot be described by a single fixed value, and plasticity is a key component of bee foraging behavior in natural environments. © The Author(s) 2018.","flower signal variability overwhelms receptor-noise and requires plastic color learning","Color discrimination thresholds proposed by receptor-noise type models are frequently"

In this work, brain proteomes of nurses and foragers were compared by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis within pH range of 4-7 in order to find proteins related to such an ontogenetic and behavioral development. Twenty differentially expressed proteins were detected by gel image computational analysis, and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Nurse brain showed increased expression of major royal jelly proteins (MRJP1, MRJP2 and MRJP7), which are related to determination of castes during the honey bee larvae differentiation. Immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy showed that MRJP1 was localized in the cytoplasm of brain cells, seemingly along filaments of the cytoskeleton, in the antennal lobe, optical lobe and mushroom body. Also, MRJP1 was deposited on the rhabdom, a structure ofthe retinular cells, composed ofnumerous tubules. Such evidence suggests that MRJP1 could be associated to proteins of filamentous structures. MRJP1 was also found in intercellular spaces between cells in mushrooms bodies, indicating that it is a secreted protein.

These colors have been proposed to act as signals for plant-insect communication. However, there is a paucity of behavioral data to allow for interpretations of how to classify these colors either as a signal or a cue when considering the natural conditions under which pollination occurs. We sampled flowers from 6 plant species across various viewpoints looking for changes in the visual appearance of the petals. Spectral characteristics were measured with different instruments to simulate both the spectral and spatial characteristics of honeybee's vision. We show the presence of color patches produced by angle dependent effects on the petals and the calyx of various species; however, the appearance of the angle dependent color patches significantly varies with viewpoint and would only be resolved by the insect eye at close distances. Behavior experiments with honeybees revealed that pollinators did not use angle dependent colors to drive behavior when presented with novel flower presentations. Results show that angle dependent colors do not comply with the requirements of a signal for plant-pollinator communication since the information transmitted by these colors would be unreliable for potential, free-flying pollination vectors. We thus classify angle dependent colors produced by micro-and ultra-structures as being a cue (a feature which has not evolved for communication), and observe no evidence supporting claims of these angle dependent colors having evolved as visual signal.","signal or cue: the role of structural colors in flower","Angle dependent colors, such as iridescence, are produced by structures"

Neotropical social vespids are a model group to study this problem as they are strong predators that rely heavily on flight while exhibiting a wide range in body size. In this paper we describe the variation in both wing shape, as wing planform, and mesosoma muscle size along the body size gradient of the Neotropical social wasps and discuss the potential factors affecting these changes. Analyses of 56 species were conducted using geometric morphometrics for the wings and lineal morphometrics for the body; independent contrast method regressions were used to correct for the phylogenetic effect. Smaller vespid species exhibit rounded wings, veins that are more concentrated in the proximal region, larger stigmata and the mesosoma is proportionally larger than in larger species. Meanwhile, larger species have more elongated wings, more distally extended venation, smaller stigmata and a proportionally smaller mesosoma. The differences in wing shape and other traits could be related to differences in flight demands caused by smaller and larger body sizes. Species around the extremes of body size distribution may invest more in flight muscle mass than species of intermediate sizes.","relationship between body size and flying-related structures in neotropical social","Body size influences wing shape and associated muscles in flying"

The view that honeybees have two discrete recruitment dances has been widely accepted since its inception in the 1920s. However, there are few detailed examinations of the behavioural parameters of dances over the range of food-source distances represented by round dances and waggle dances. Here, we show that both the round dance and the waggle dance convey information about distance and direction and that there is no clear switch between the two.

The reason for this imprecision has been the subject of recent debate. Some have suggested that imprecision within dances is non-adaptive, ie, that dancing bees are limited in their ability to indicate more precise directional information; two hypotheses regarding possible limitations are examined. The 'brief-return-phase' hypothesis proposes that when signaling a nearby food source, the duration of the return phase (the time between successive waggle phases) is brief and a dancing bee does not have enough time or space to orient her waggle phases precisely. Similarly, the 'brief-waggle-phase' hypothesis proposes that a short waggle-phase duration prevents dancing bees from precisely orienting their waggle phases. Other investigators have suggested that the imprecision within dances is adaptive. The 'tuned-error' hypothesis proposes that the imprecision in dances serves to spread recruits over an optimal patch size tuned by natural selection. Here, these three hypotheses are investigated by analyzing 572 dances for food sources at 10 distances from the hive. It was found that the duration of the return phase does not differ in dances for near and far food sources, indicating that the imprecision is not caused by limitations imposed by brief return phases. It was also found that the scatter of waggle phase angles after left or right turns does not steadily increase as waggle phase duration decreases, indicating that the imprecision is not caused by limitations imposed by brief waggle phases. Finally, it was found that while patch size indicated within dances increases as distance to the food source increases, it does so at a rate significantly less than would be expected if bees were not adjusting their directional information in response to distance, thereby supporting the hypothesis of an adaptive value to the imprecision within dances for nearby food sources. © 2007 E.

Effective Integrated Crop Pollination (ICP) involves adaptable, targeted and cost-effective management of crop pollination and encourages the use of both wild and managed pollinators where appropriate. In this study we investigate how the addition of honeybee hives affects the community of insects visiting oilseed rape, and if hive number and location affect pollinator foraging and oilseed rape pollination in order to provide evidence for effective ICP. We found that introducing hives increased overall flower visitor numbers and altered the pollinator community, which became dominated by honeybees. Furthermore a greater number of hives did not increase bee numbers significantly but did result in honeybees foraging further into fields. The timing of surveys and proximity to the field edge influenced different pollinators in different ways and represents an example of spatial and temporal complementarity. For example dipteran flower visitor numbers declined away from the field edge whereas honeybees peaked at intermediate distances into the field. Furthermore, no significant effects of survey round on wild bees overall was observed but honeybee numbers were relatively lower during peak flowering and dipteran abundance was greater in later survey rounds. Thus combining diverse wild pollinators and managed species for crop pollination buffers spatial and temporal variation in flower visitation.

Here we investigate the value of hedgerows in Southern England as a source of functionally important taxa, and how hedgerow quality and local landscape composition impact on their potential contribution to sustainable agriculture in arable landscapes. We show that hedgerows are a source habitat for many natural enemies which spill over into neighbouring fields, and that hedgerows provide a valuable forage resource and corridor for movement of pollinators. Hedgerow quality affects these benefits and continuous unbroken hedgerows, with a high diversity of woody species, are more valuable for the provision of bumblebees and Linyphiid spiders, while the presence of trees within the hedgerow supports Lycosid spiders. Floral resources, beyond the woody hedgerow species themselves, are also a key forage resource for hoverflies. The impact of these hedgerows on invertebrate abundance is moderated by local landscape, and hedgerows are a more valuable forage resource for pollinators in more intensely managed landscapes. Our study shows that in order to support abundant and a broad range of natural enemies and pollinators in agricultural landscapes, both hedgerows and local semi-natural habitats need to be protected and managed.

Because the breeding system influences both demographic (reproductive success) and genetic (inbreeding depression, evolutionary potential) parameters that are crucial for population maintenance, the reproductive ecology of E. alpinum was investigated. Specifically, the aims of the study were (1) to determine the factors (resources and/or pollen) limiting plant fitness; and (2) to assess the potential for gene flow within a plant, within a patch of plants, and across a whole valley where the species is abundant. • Methods: Field experiments were performed at two sites in the Fournel valley, France, over three consecutive years. Studies included a phenological survey, observations of pollinators (visitation rates and flight distances), dispersal of a fluorescent powder used as a pollen analogue, the use of seed traps, determination of the pollen/ ovule ratio, and an experiment to test whether seed production is limited by pollen and/or by resources. • Key results: E. alpinum is pollinated by generalist pollinators, visitation rates are very high and seed set is resource- rather than pollen-limited. The short flights of honeybees indicate a high potential for geitonogamy, and low pollen and seed dispersals suggest strong genetic structure over short distances. These results are interpreted in the light of previous molecular markers studies, which, in contrast, showed complete outcrossing and high genetic homogeneity. • Conclusions. The study highlights the usefulness of adopting several complementary approaches to understanding the dynamic processes at work in natural populations, and the conservation implications for E. alpinum are emphasized. Although the studied populations do not seem threatened in the near future, long-term monitoring appears necessary to assess the impact of habitat fragmentation.

Foraging rates (flowers visited per minute) and flower handling times did not differ between honey bee and bumble bee foragers; however, bumble bees tended to fly farther between consecutive flower visits and make fewer moves to nearest neighbouring flowers than honey bees. When bees were forced to specialize on one of two previously rewarding flower colours by depleting one colour of reward, honey bees required almost twice as many flower visits to specialize on the rewarding flower colour as bumble bees.

We examined these questions in an alpine ecosystem in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, focusing on four alpine bumble bee species ( Bombus balteatus, B. flavifrons, B. bifarius, and B. sylvicola), and two host plants that differ in their degrees of pollinator specialization ( Trifolium dasyphyllum and T. parryi ). Using microsatellites, we found that estimated colony abundances among Bombus species ranged from ∼18 to 78 colonies/0.01 km2. The long-tongued species B. balteatus was most common, especially high above treeline, but the subalpine species B. bifarius was unexpectedly abundant for this elevation range. Nests detected among sampled foragers of each species were correlated with the number of foragers caught. Foraging ranges were smaller than expected for all Bombus species, ranging from 25 to 110 m. Fruit set for the specialized plant, Trifolium parryi, was positively related to the abundance of its Bombus pollinator. In contrast, fruit set for the generalized plant, T. dasyphyllum, was related to abundance of all Bombus species. Because forager abundance was related to nest abundance of each Bombus species and was an equally effective predictor of plant fecundity, forager inventories are probably suitable for assessing the health of outcrossing plant populations. However, nest abundance, rather than forager abundance, better reflects demographic and genetic health in populations of eusocial pollinators such as bumble bees. Development of models incorporating the parameters we have measured here (nest abundance, forager abundance, and foraging distance) could increase the usefulness of foraging worker inventories in monitoring, managing, and conserving pollinator populations. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.","bumble bee nest abundance, foraging distance, and host-plant reproduction: implications","Recent reports of global declines in pollinator species imply an"

The present study aimed to describe the floral biology and reproductive aspects of Collaea cipoensis, a shrub restricted to small patches alongside watercourses in rupestrian grasslands of Serra do Cipo, Brazil. Specifically, weexamined the dependence on pollinators to set fruits and the functional role of floral visitors (i.e. pollinators, nectar-robbers, nectar-thieves, and florivores). Collaea cipoensis is a strictly xenogamous species and two hummingbirds (Colibri serrirostris and Eupetomena macroura) are its potential pollinators. Although C. serrirostris also behaves as illegitimate visitor, it represents 90% of legitimate visits, thus being the most important pollinator. However, the most common flower visitors are two important nectar-robbers, the bee Trigona spinipes and the syrphid Toxomerus musicus. The species is self-incompatible and pollen-limited, as hand-pollination increased fruit production more than 50%. Still, hand-pollination set only 20% of fruits and 48% of seeds. Overall, the dependence on cross-pollination, the stressful environmental conditions and the high floral visitation rates by illegitimate visitors may limit reproduction of this species, leading to a fitness reduction.

The visitation rates of these pollinators to eggplant flowers declined significantly with distance from the wild habitat. The importance of wild plants as alternative forage source for pollinators was assessed by a survey of the flowering plants in different habitats surrounding eggplant fields. While ruderal farm weeds provide much of these resources, the Acacia tortilis riverine forest experienced high visitation rates in one critical period of the dry season.

A survey of hygienic behaviour and brood diseases was conducted on 649 colonies in eastern Australia to initiate a selective breeding program targeting disease resistance and provide a level of resistance to Varroa (Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman and V. jacobsoni Oudemans) mites should they become established in Australia. The test population showed a remarkably high baseline level of hygienic behaviour with 17% of colonies meeting or exceeding breeding selection thresholds. Colonies belonging to a breeding program were 5.8 times more likely to be highly hygienic and colonies headed by queens raised from hygienic queen mothers were 2.2 times more likely. Nectar availability (nectar yielding flowering plants within honey bee forage range) influenced hygienic behaviour expression but was not a significant predictor of level of hygienic behaviour. Surprisingly, hygienic behaviour was not a significant predictor of the presence of infection of the honey bee brood disease chalkbrood (Ascosphaera apis) and was not influential in predicting severity of chalkbrood infection in surveyed honey bee colonies.

The reproductive output of Shorea siamensis, a widespread dipterocarp tree, was assessed in relation to disturbance and tree density at three sites in western Thailand during the 1996 and 1997 flowering seasons. The locations were similar except in disturbance history, which was reflected in decreasing tree density from undisturbed via moderately disturbed to disturbed sites. 2. Hand pollination experiments showed S. siamensis to be partially self-incompatible due to differential pollen tube growth and abortion of inbred fruit. Although more than 90% of flowers from trees at all sites were pollinated, pollen tubes developed in only a small proportion of these flowers. Both pollen tube development and initial fruit production were highest at the undisturbed site. Many fruit, presumably selfed, were aborted during development at all sites, but significantly more fruit were aborted at the disturbed site, resulting in lowered production of mature fruit. 3. Shorea siamensis was pollinated by small Trigona bees, which exhibited significant declines in intertree movements with increasing distance between flowering trees. As resource availability did not differ between sites, differences in mature fruit set were considered to be mediated by changes in pollinator foraging behaviour at differing tree densities. Variation in seed set was found to be negatively correlated with distance to nearest conspecific both within and between sites. 4. At the two least disturbed sites observed seed set values corresponded with those expected by calculation. However, seed set at the disturbed site was significantly lower than expected. 5. Our results suggest that high reproductive success of S. siamensis is dependent upon cross-pollination which, through pollinator behaviour, is a function of tree isolation. This species may thus be subject to the Allee effect, where population viability is reduced disproportionately with a decline in population size or, as in this study, population density. The implications of these results for population recovery and genetic structure following disturbance are discussed.","disturbance-induced density-dependent seed set in shorea siamensis (dipterocarpaceae), a tropical","1.

This study investigates the impact of logging in Thailand and forest fragmentation in Costa Rica on the pollination and seed production of two self-incompatible forest trees. Logging in a dry deciduous dipterocarp forest in Thailand resulted in reduced densities of the common dipterocarp tree Shorea siamensis and variably isolated individual trees. The number of flower visits to S. siamensis by pollinating Trigona bees was not affected by logging disturbance. However, pollinators did spend longer periods of time foraging in the canopies of isolated trees which were more prevalent in logged areas where tree density had been reduced. Consequently, at the logged site few cross-pollinations were effected and fruit set of S. siamensis was considerably lower than at nearby unlogged sites where distances between flowering conspecifics were smaller. Reduced fruit set has long-term implications for the recovery of S. siamensis populations in disturbed areas, and local population genetic structure is likely to be affected as reduced outcrossing rates among trees in disturbed regions results in relatively inbred seed. In Costa Rica forest fragmentation has restricted the once widespread tree Anacardium excelsum to forest patches located in an agriculturally-dominated landscape. As with S. siamensis, the abundance of pollinators, also Trigona bees, in the canopies of A. excelsum was largely unaffected by fragment size. Nevertheless, pollination success and seed production was positively correlated with fragment size. We propose that small bees rarely move between forest fragments and gene exchange through pollination occurs predominantly among trees within fragments and, together with likely low genetic variability in small fragments, that this contributes to the observed reduced fertilisation and seed set of A. excelsum. Thus increased tree isolation tree through selective logging or habitat fragmentation by forest clearance can result in reduced seed set due to changes in the foraging patterns of poorly mobile pollinators. Even if population sizes of the pollinators are maintained following environmental perturbation, this study shows that disturbance may disrupt pollination processes through changes in pollinator foraging behaviour. More attention needs to be focussed on changes in the behaviour of species involved in key ecological interactions following disturbance events in tropical forests.","reproductive ecology of tropical forest trees in logged and fragmented","Invertebrates mediate several important ecological processes, including pollination and seed"

In order to understand the foraging behaviour of honey bee colonies and preference among the available floral resources, pollen collections from three experimental healthy colonies of honey bees were analysed in the month of June. Results: The amount of pollen collections were related to the colony's need which was indicated by the number of larval and adult bees present in the hive. Interesting was the sequence of pollen collection from different floral sources. All honey bee colonies collected pollens from Trifolium repens first, then Erigeron annus and the third choice was Coreopsis drummondii and Oenothera biennis flowers. Total protein content of Trifolium pollen was the highest (20.0 g/100 g DM), and the others were in the range of 8.9-11.4 g/100 g DM. Conclusion: The results indicated that the first criteria for honey bee foraging preference of pollens would be the nutritional contents of protein and the resource availability of the lesser nutritious floral sources.

Research oriented towards a better understanding of the joint effects of land use and climate change over the provision of specific ecosystem services is therefore essential to safeguard such services. Here we propose a methodological framework, which integrates species distribution forecasts and graph theory to identify key conservation areas, which if protected or restored could improve habitat connectivity and safeguard ecosystem services. We applied the proposed framework to the provision of pollination services by a tropical stingless bee (Melipona quadrifasciata), a key pollinator of native flora from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and important agricultural crops. Based on the current distribution of this bee and that of the plant species used to feed and nest, we projected the joint distribution of bees and plants in the future, considering a moderate climate change scenario (following IPPC). We then used this information, the bee's flight range, and the current mapping of Atlantic Forest remnants to infer habitat suitability and quantify local and regional habitat connectivity for 2030, 2050 and 2080. Our results revealed north to south and coastal to inland shifts in the pollinator distribution during the next 70 years. Current and future connectivity maps unraveled the most important corridors, which if protected or restored, could facilitate the dispersal and establishment of bees during distribution shifts. Our results also suggest that coffee plantations from eastern São Paulo and southern Minas Gerais States could suffer a pollinator deficit in the future, whereas pollination services seem to be secured in southern Brazil. Landowners and governmental agencies could use this information to implement new land use schemes. Overall, our proposed methodological framework could help design novel conservational and agricultural practices that can be crucial to conserve ecosystem services by buffering the joint effect of habitat configuration and climate change.

This study was conducted to provide the first annotated checklist of the bee (Apoidea: Anthophila) fauna of Michigan, summarizing aspects of their taxonomy and behavior and to provide provisional conservation assessment. The list was compiled from a critical review of published literature, museum specimens, and database records, supplemented by new collections. In total, 465 species are included in the checklist, including 38 new records, however evidence for 13 species is poor, several more species require taxonomic revision, and the presence of additional species is expected. The exotic megachilid species Megachile apicalis Spinola, M. pusilla Pérez (=concinna Smith, auct.) and Osmia taurus Smith are reported from Michigan for the first time. New state records of native species include Anthidium tenuiflorae Cockerell and Nomada alpha alpha Cockerell, both previously undocumented from eastern North America, and Nomada sphaerogaster Cockerell, which has rarely been recognized. The taxonomy of some bee species is clarified by the formal publication of 11 new synonymies (some previously reported online or in manuscripts).

There were significant morphological differences between sub-populations of Alkanna, mainly between plants from the narrower wadis and those on the interconnecting plain. Flowers on the plain were larger, with wider corollas and more nectar standing crop; these plants retained more flowers on the inflorescence, but received many fewer visits to flowers. There was a significant selection gradient between flower size and maternal fitness (seed set) in the plain, but not elsewhere. Natural selection may have increased resources devoted to attracting insect visitors in response to fewer pollinating visits in the plain.

We measured pollen collection by native bumble bees (Bombus Latreille; Hymenoptera: Apidae) and the introduced honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus; Hymenoptera: Apidae) foraging on two common native plants in habitat fragments with varying invasive (Cytisus scoparius (Linnaeus) Link; Fabaceae) density.

While some native bumble bees species collect an increasing proportion of C. scoparius pollen with increasing C. scoparius density, this did not translate into an increased potential for pollination. Rather, measures of effective pollination decline with C. scoparius density. Overall, our results suggest that some bee species may be better at finding resources at highly invaded sites.

These factors have been at the core of proposed explanations for the reproductive failure and numerical decline of Acacia carneorum and other threatened acacias. Paradoxically, the sympatric Acacia ligulata is thriving and highly fecund. Although these species have superficially similar floral displays, differences in sexual reproductive success may reflect interactions between flower and inflorescence ontogeny and pollinator assemblages. We compared the floral biology and flower visitor assemblages of A. carneorum and A. ligulata at four sites per species. Both species displayed similar floral ontogeny and synchronicity of display, with inflorescences simultaneously hermaphroditic for 4-5 days. However, A. ligulata displayed a higher density of flowers than A. carneorum and, while both species received a range of flower visitors, A. ligulata was visited by relatively few species and was serviced primarily by the non-native honeybee Apis mellifera, which typically made many within-plant movements during foraging bouts. In contrast, A. carneorum was visited by a diverse suite of native insects that carried little pollen and made fewer within plant movements. On average, Apis mellifera carried 98.4 % A. ligulata pollen, whereas the native insect visitors of A. carneorum carried only 45 % A. carneorum pollen.

In northern-hemisphere systems, mass flowering plants can act as ‘pollinator magnets’. Magnets can reduce the pollination success of adjacent co-flowering neighbours by drawing pollinators from these plants. However, magnets can also produce pollination ‘spillover-effects’ through increased pollinator movements to adjacent co-flowering taxa, potentially either increasing pollination or impacting it through transfer of mixed-species pollen. The impact of agricultural species on co-flowering plants in Australia is unknown. Native Australian plants evolved with unique pollinators and yet agricultural pollination is dominated by the exotic honeybee Apis mellifera. We tested how distance (to 250 m) from each of two populations of Lavender (Lavandula spp.) (2 years), Nectarines (Prunus persica var. nucipersica or var. nectarina) (1 year) and the pasture weed Paterson's Curse (Echium plantagineum) (2 years) affected pollinator diversity and abundance within experimental arrays of native and northern-hemisphere plants. For Paterson's Curse, we tested whether visitation varied when honeybee abundance was experimentally increased. As expected, we found magnets attracted significantly more honeybee visits in all possible comparisons across combinations of species, sites and years. However, contrary to expectation, in 10 of 18 comparisons, co-flowering species supported a slightly higher diversity of pollinators than magnets, with honeybees comprising a significantly lower proportion of flower visitors in 14 comparisons. The exceptions, which included populations of all three magnet species, were cases where honeybees were the only visitor (6 comparisons) or the magnet and co-flowering species were each visited by a single but different pollinator (2 compariosns). Most strikingly, our data provided no evidence of pollinator spillover. More than 95% of all pollinators on co-flowering species carried only their pollen and overall pollinator abundance didn't vary significantly with distance from magnets at any site or time. Honeybee abundance did not vary significantly with distance from magnets. For Paterson's Curse, the addition of managed hives increased honeybee abundance on co-flowering species in two of eight cases, but pollinator abundance didn't vary with distance from the magnet. Overall, we found few direct effects of mass flowering agricultural species on the pollination of either Australian native or exotic neighbours. The lack of spillover-effects may largely reflect the unusually high species fidelity of foraging A. mellifera. However, the numerical dominance of honeybees within Australian agricultural systems may impact pollination at the regional level. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","do mass flowering agricultural species affect the pollination of australian","Australian agricultural landscapes are dominated by northern-hemisphere mass flowering species,"

These localities are approximately at the same latitude (Mairinque 23 degrees 52'S and Campos do Jordao 22 degrees 45' S), but with a difference of 1000m in the altitude between them. As same latitudes ensure similar photoperiods and the difference in altitude, a persistent step in the temperature, the field work was conducted in environmental conditions varying within a known and limited range. Circadian rhythms are described for pollen and nectar harvesting behaviours, which are finely adjusted to the flower's anthesis and withering.

In addition to specialized structures to collect the pollen of L.elegans, the acrophases of pollen and nectar collection rhythms coincide with the rime when the stigma is most receptive and consequently the possibility of pollination increases highly.","circadian rhythms of pollen and nectar collection by bees on","The visits of Tetraglossula ventralis (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) and Heterosarellus sp"

Directional movement by foraging honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) was studied on several flower arrays. The most frequent move among equidistant flower stalks was straight ahead from stalk to stalk with frequencies decreasing for increasing turn angles. Turns to the left were about equal in frequency to turns to the right. Bees maintained directionality when moving from flower stalks that had been rotated 90° counterclockwise while the bee was on the stalk (no difference between moves from rotated stalks and unrotated controls). Thus, directionality is maintained by the bee and is not an artefact of flower distribution. Bees also maintained directionality when the entire array was rotated around the flower stalk the bee was on. Thus, bees use an external cue to orientate in a given direction rather than fixing on an inflorescence within the flower array. Bees foraging on very different flower arrays differed in patterns of directionality and in distances flown between flower stalks. Therefore, even though bees maintain directionality using external cues, flower distribution can nevertheless influence flight patterns. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell.

The death of bees has been correlated with the use of neonicotinoid-coated seed and the toxic particulates emitted by pneumatic drilling machines. The contamination of foragers in flight over the ploughed fields has been hypothesized. The airborne contamination has been proven, both with bees inside fixed cages around the field and in free flight near the driller. A new trial involving mobile cages has been established and consists of making rapid passes with single bees inside cages fixed to an aluminium bar. The bar was moved by two operators at different distances from the working drilling machine. A single pass was shown as sufficient to kill all the bees exposed to exhaust air on the emission side of the drill, when bees were subsequently held in high relative humidity. The extent of toxic cloud around driller was evaluated at the height of 0.5, 1.8 and 3.5m and proved to be about 20m in diameter, with an ellipsoidal shape. The shape may be influenced by working speed of the drill and environmental parameters, and is easily shown by adding talc powder to the seed in the machine hopper. A new driller equipment was evaluated consisting of two tubes inclined towards the soil that direct the exhaust air towards the ground. The survival rate of the bees was not substantially increased using the modified drill and was lower than 50%. Chemical analyses show up to 4000ng of insecticide in single bees with an average content around 300ng. Similar quantities were observed at increased distances from the modified or unmodified drillers. This new evaluation of bee mortality in the field is an innovative biological test to verify the hypothetical efficiency (or not) of driller modifications. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.","aerial powdering of bees inside mobile cages and the extent","Sudden losses of bees have been observed in spring during"

Honeybees Apis mellifera ligustica were trained to work on a patch with artificial rewarding and non-rewarding flowers, coupled to an air extractor. The perceptual colour distance between the rewarding and the non-rewarding flowers was varied and the flower choice and the repellent scent-marking behaviour of the bees were recorded. 2. The discrimination between rewarding and non-rewarding flowers depended on their colour distance, improving with a greater colour difference. This task was guided thus visually and was not affected by activating the air extractor. 3. The scent-marking activity was only observable when the colour information of both groups of flowers was the same or very similar. This thus represents the first reported case of a modulation of an olfactory activity through the visual input provided by colour distances. When the air extractor was activated, rejections associated with the scent-marking behaviour disappeared, thus confirming the olfactory nature of this behaviour. 4. Honeybees are thus capable of using one or more sensory cues to enhance their foraging efficiency, according to the environmental situation. This great plasticity allows them to attain an enhanced efficiency while foraging. 5. We successfully applied the model of colour choice behaviour of the honeybee.

The impact connection of these particles is demonstrated by iridium anomalies, unique platinum group elements patterns, and Ni-rich mineral phases. Densely packed tsunami-transported fragments and boulders overlie microkrystite units of the >2,629 ± 5 Ma top Jeerinah Impact Layer (JIL).

The two impact cycles are separated by a stratigraphically consistent silicified black siltstone, representing a ""Quiet Interval."" The SMB turbidites display turbulence eddies, climbing ripples, conglomerate pockets, slumps, and waterlogged sediment deformation features. Consequences of tsunami in the probably contemporaneous Carawine Dolomite (Pb-Pb carbonate ages of ∼2.56-2.54 Ga), eastern Hamersley Basin, include sub-autochthonous below-wave base excavation and megabrecciation of sea floor substrata, resulting in a unique 10-30-m-thick spherule-bearing megabreccia marker mapped over a nearly 100-km north-south strike distance in the east Hamersley Basin. The field relations suggest a pre-tsunami settling of the bulk of the spherules. Tsunami wave effects include: (1) dispersal of the spherule-rich soft upper sea floor sediments as a subaqueous mud cloud and (2) excavation of consolidated substrata below the soft sediment zone. Excavation and megabrecciation included injection of liquefied spherule-bearing microbreccia into dilated fractures in the disrupted underlying carbonates. Near-perfect preservation of the spherules within the basal microbreccia veins suggests tsunami-induced hydraulic pressures locally exceeded lithostatic pressure. Late-stage settling of spherule-bearing mud clouds in the wake of the tsunami is represented by an abundance of spherules in the uppermost microbreccia zones of the megabreccia pile. From the deep below-wave base facies of the Carawine Dolomite, tsunami wave amplitudes may have exceeded 200 m depth. The ∼2.47-2.50 Ga DGS4 (S4 Macroband, Dales Gorge Member, Brockman Iron Formation) fallout units include exotic chert and carbonate boulders transported by tsunami following settling of a 10-20-cm-thick microkrystite and microtektite-rich unit. Seismic perturbations preceding deposition of the JIL and SMB fallout units are marked by rip-up clasts. The geochemistry of microkrystites and microtektites suggests impact fallout originated from impacts in simatic/ oceanic crustal regions, although tsunami waves may have originated from seismically reactivated faults and plate margins located at distance from the impact craters. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","early precambrian asteroid impact-triggered tsunami: excavated seabed, debris flows, exotic","Pioneering studies of Precambrian impact fallout units and associated tsunami"

In the case of the Eastern honey bee Apis cerana and the Western honey bee Apis mellifera, an additional possible reproductive outcome has been posited: interspecific sperm triggers queens to produce daughters from unfertilized eggs via thelytokous parthenogenesis. Such an outcome would go unnoticed in natural population mergers, as queens, which are polyandrous, are likely to mate with both conspecific and interspecific males. We performed reciprocal crosses between A. mellifera and A. cerana via artificial insemination, plus control inseminations of saline (five queens per species per treatment), and genetically assessed the sex and origin of any resulting offspring. Neither A. cerana nor A. mellifera queens produced viable female brood after receiving interspecific semen, indicating a high cost of interspecific mating for both species. In two A. cerana colonies headed by cross-inseminated queens, workers responded by activating ovaries and laying eggs that were mainly male but occasionally female (i.e. thelytokous, 2% of brood), despite the queen's continued presence in the nest. We conclude that thelytoky is not a consistent response to interspecific mating by queens of A. mellifera or A. cerana. Rather, at least in A. cerana, when colonies are faced with ""mis-mated"" queens, it may be up to the workers to secure the reproductive future of the colony.","no evidence of queen thelytoky following interspecific crosses of the","The human-mediated dispersal of species over geographical boundaries can bring"

"1305","Goldblatt P.","phylogeny and classification of the iridaceae and the relationships of iris",2000,"Annali di Botanica","","Iridaceae are a well defined family of some 1800 species and between 60 and 70 genera. Molecular studies of chloroplast DNA has confirmed the position of the family in the order Asparagales, contrary to earlier work that placed the Iridaceae in Liliales. The family comprises two large assemblages of species, currently regarded as subfamilies Ixioideae and Iridaceae. The relationships of the remaining seven genera, included in subfamilies Isophysidoideae and Nivenioideae, have been rendered uncertain because of the lack of congruence between molecular and morphological studies using different outgroups and/or different data sets. Ixioideae, the largest subfamily, comprises more than half the total species in the family. Largely African, with fair representation in Eurasia, the generic phylogeny of Ixioideae is poorly understood. Most genera exhibit a considerable range of floral diversity based on floral zygomorphy and the elaboration or reduction of the perianth tube. Production of floral nectar and pollination by long-tongued insects including anthophorine bees, Lepidoptera, longproboscid flies and birds is a recurring theme but reversals to actinomorphy, often accompanied by the suppression of nectar production, has occurred in species of several genera that are pollinated by hopliine beetles. Virtually worldwide in distribution, Iridoideae comprise five tribes, the Australian Diplarrheneae, the Australasian and American Sisyrinchieae, the exclusively American Trimezieae (= Mariceae) and Tigridieae, and the Old World Irideae. Iris and Moraea constitute the major genera of this last tribe, Iris a North Temperate genus and Moraea largely sub-Saharan African. Several small genera allied to Iris or Moraea are believed to have flowers modified for different pollination strategies and have been shown by molecular data to be nested with one or other of the larger genera. Vegetative diversity, especially in the leaf and rootstock, is an important variable in Iris whereas floral divergence and vegetative uniformity characterize Moraea. Genera of Irideae appear to be primarily adapted for pollination by bees foraging for nectar and pollen transfer is passive. Specialization has shifted the pollination strategy either to a generalist system using flies, bees and beetles, or a specialist system using bees foraging for pollen, or carrion flies attracted to foul odors, or hopliine beetles that use flowers as sites for assembly and mating.","phylogeny and classification of the iridaceae and the relationships of","Iridaceae are a well defined family of some 1800 species"

These include passerine birds and insects of four different orders, Hymenoptera (mainly Apidae), Diptera (mainly Nemestrinidae), Coleoptera (Scarabacidae), and Lepidoptera (mainly Noctuidae). Apid pollination involves two discrete systems - passive pollination by anthophorines and native Apis mellifera foraging for nectar and active pollen gathering by A. mellifera and other Apoidea foraging for pollen. From what is known about relationships within Babiana and Crocoideae, it seems likely that passive pollination by anthophorines and honeybees, with nectar secreted in zygomorphic, bilabiate flowers as a reward, is the ancestral condition; it is also the most common, demonstrated for 18 and inferred for 35 more species from all three taxonormc sections of the genus. Active pollination by honeybees and female Apoidea foraging for pollen was demonstrated in one species and is inferred for four more, all of which have radially symmetric flowers and prominent anthers. Pollination by long-proboscid nemestrinids, mostly species of Prosoeca, is recorded for 13 species and inferred for five more, while moth pollination is recorded for one species and inferred for another two. Pollination exclusively by hopbine scarab beetles, known for six species, is associated with development of radial symmetry of the flower. Passerine bird pollination, associated with the classic syndrome of a wide floral tube, red floral pigmentation, and rigid, well-exserted stamens, occurs in two species, and is inferred for one more. Species with a bimodal system in which bees and beetles both visit and accomplish pollen transfer is known for three species. Comparing pollination systems with what is known about species relationships in Babiana, we infer that long-proboscid fly pollination evolved at least four times and moth pollination three times. Active pollination by pollen-collecting bees and hopliine beetle pollination also probably evolved three times each and bird pollination twice. Pollination systems are labile, and we postulate that there has been a minimum of 14 shifts in pollination system, approximately one shift for every six species. Lastly, Babiana species show the same correlation of morphology and floral presentation with particular sets of pollinators, described for several other genera of Iridaceae, e.g., Gladiolus L., Hesperantha Ker Gawl., and Lapeirousia Pourr., as well as Geraniaceae and Orchidaceae. This increases our confidence in predicting pollinators on the basis of floral presentation in other species and genera in which pollinators have not been established.","floral biology of babiana (iridaceae: crocoideae): adaptive floral radiation and","Field observations, floral dissections, floral nectar, and pollen load analyses"

The stamens are exserted from the tube and have brown anthers prominently displayed on filaments ± 4.5 mm long. The perianth tube contains 0.7-1.2 μl of nectar in the lower half with a mean concentration of 23.5% sucrose equivalents. The flowers are visited systematically by an unnamed species of Prosoeca, a long-proboscid fly in the family Nemestrinidae, and occasionally by the butterfly Cynthia cardui (Nymphalidae) and the anthophorine bee Amegilla spilostoma (Apidae). The flies have a proboscis 10.5-11.5 mm long, which when inserted into the floral tube reaches the nectar held within the lower half of the tube. The frons and the proximal part of the head of the Prosoeca sp. contact the anthers during feeding, and the flies accumulate visible quantities of brown pollen during foraging bouts. Observations showed that these insects also contacted the stigmatic surfaces of style branches during this activity. Amegilla bees, which occasionally visit Romulea flowers, have a tongue ± 7 mm long and fail to reach the nectar when they insert their proboscis into the tube. Because of their small size they do not brush against the anthers or style branches when they attempt to forage. These observations confirm our prediction of long-proboscid fly pollination in this species of Romulea, based on the floral morphology of the species, and expands the range of plant species known to have flowers adapted for pollination by this group of insects. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Blandus, Densiflorus, Hebea, Heterocolon, Homoglossum, Linearifolius, Ophiolyza) show that 42 species are pollinated largely by polylectic bees in the family Apidae, 2 species by bees of the families Andrenidae or Halictidae, and 1 by a combination of hopliine beetles (Scarabaeidae) and Andrenidae. The floral phenology, attractants, diversity of floral foragers, and sometimes the rewards, vary according to geography and are not correlated with taxonomy. Flowering in most Gladiolus species in the southern African winter-rainfall zone coincides with the end of the wet season, August to October, but a few flower from February to April at the end of the dry season. They have sweetly fragrant flowers with a wide range of colors and markings. These species receive a diversity of floral foragers including bees in the genera Allodape, Amegilla, Andrenu, Anthophora, Apis, and Pachymelus. Most Gladiolus species of the summer-rainfall zone flower from December to April, from the middle to the end of the wet season, but a few species bloom from August to November, at the end of the dry season. Their flowers have no discernible fragrance and are colored mostly in shades of pink to mauve or white. Most floral foragers collected on these species were bees in the genus Amegilla, but other bee genera, as well as flies in the genera Prosoeca and Stenobasipteron, were captured. Among the southern African species of Gladiolus pollinated by bees, there are two distinct pollination strategies. The majority have bilabiate, 'gullet' flowers or 'flag' flowers that secrete sucrose-rich nectar at the base of an obliquely funnel-shaped floral tube 9-20 mm long with the lower, narrow part 5-15 mm long. Apis mellifera and large-bodied anthophorine bees (especially Amegilla and Anthophora) contact dehiscent anthers and/or receptive stigmas while probing the tube for nectar with elongated probosces. In contrast, G. brevitubus, G. quadrangularis, and G. stellatus have rotate, actinomorphic (or subactinomorphic) perianths offering little or no nectar at the base of tubes less than 7 mm long. Andrenu species or Apis mellifera contact both dehiscent anthers and receptive stigmas of G. stellatus or G. quadrangularis, respectively, while foraging for pollen. An additional 53 Gladiolus species also have bilabiate, gullet or flag flowers with obliquely funnel-shaped tubes 9-20 mm long (the most common flower type in the genus), and are presumed also to be adapted for pollination by long-tongued anthophorine and honey bees. The actinomorphic, rotate floral form is present in 2 more species. Thus, 60% of the Gladiolus species in southern Africa may be regarded as being pollinated by bees, and the overwhelming majority of these species (95%) have gullet or flag flowers and are visited primarily by long-tongued anthophorine bees that are foraging for nectar. The remaining species of Gladiolus in southern Africa have flowers with elongate perianth tubes and are adapted for pollination by sunbirds or insects other than bees, most importantly long-tongued flies (Nemestrinidac, Tabanidae), moths, and the large satyrid butterfly, Aeropetes.","adaptive radiation of bee-pollinated gladiolus species (iridaceae) in southern africa","Observations on the flowers of 45 of 166 species of"

The study was carried out in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada, Spain, over four years (1988-1991). We selected three populations of H. spinosa located along a wide altitudinal gradient. This plant species was visited during the four years of the study by at least 70 species of insects belonging to five orders and 19 families. The assemblage of floral visitors of H. spinosa was composed mainly of ants and different species of solitary bees and flies, although most pollinators were comparatively rare. There were striking similarities between most pollinator species in the distributions of flight distance between consecutive flowers, which were leptokurtic and highly skewed. Moreover, almost all visitors acted as pollinators, depositing pollen grains enough for seed production. Insects visiting flowers of H. spinosa can be divided into two guilds: nectarivores (small flies and ants) and pollinivores (bees and hoverflies), which differ in pollination attributes. Flower-visitation rates were quite different between the faster pollinivores and the slower nectarivores. All nectarivorous species moved almost exclusively between flowers of the same plant, whereas pollinivores sometimes moved between plants; and pollinivores deposited more pollen grains per visit than did nectarivores. H. spinosa interacted most frequently with the nectarivorous Proformica longiseta, Fannia scalaris, and Exechia dorsalis in the two lowest elevation populations of Sierra Nevada, and with the pollinivorous Colletes sp. and Eristalis tenax in the highest elevation population. The mutualistic interaction between H. spinosa and its pollinators is a generalized system, where the traits of the flower allow almost every floral visitor to act as a true, effective, pollinator. The lack of differences in per-visit pollination effectiveness and the functional equivalence of very different pollinators may help to maintain this generalized system.","generalization vs. specialization in the pollination system of hormathophylla spinosa","This study describes the interaction between Hormathophylla spinosa, a crucifer"

The present objective is to determine the correlation among the descriptors of bees and wasps assemblages with fragment predictors (size, connectivity and edge effect) within a fragmented landscape of Semidecidual Seasonal Forest (Parana State, Brazil). For this purpose five forest fragments, from three to 484 hectares, were sampled during a year, summing up 480 samples of baited traps and 3,480 of bowl traps. We have found that abundance of Apinae and oligolectic bees increase and the richness of Augochlorini bees decreases with increasing fragment size. Connectivity has positively influenced bee richness and edge effect has positively influenced the abundance of oligoletic bees. Orchid bees also respond to the site predictors, especially for the Eufriesea violacea, which abundance was positively correlated with fragment size and connectivity, however negatively with edge effect, and Eufriesea nigrita which abundance was negatively correlated with fragment size, but positively with edge effect. Composition of bees, Crabronidae and Pompilidae wasps were influenced by fragment size. Plebeia droryana and Tetrapedia diversipes could be considered as indicators, according to their sensitiveness to habitat predictors. Our results are congruent with previous studies which found that bees are sensitive to landscape fragmentation, we suggest that the group be used in ecological indicator and monitoring studies.","bee and wasp responses to a fragmented landscape in southern","The available studies on Hymenoptera assemblages in fragmented landscapes have"

The goals of this paper are to clarify the identity of these specimens, assess the species limits of E. coerulescens, and to evaluate suitability of habitats in the USA for this adventive species. Herein, we revise the species in the coerulescens group using morphological features of both sexes and confirm that the specimens of Eufriesea from the USA are E. coerulescens. We recognize the following six species in the coerulescens group: E. coerulescens, E. micheneri Ayala & Engel, E. simillima (Moure & Michener), which is reinstated from synonym with E. coerulescens, and three new species from Mexico (E. barthelli Gonzalez & Griswold, sp. n., E. engeli Gonzalez & Griswold, sp. n., and E. oliveri Gonzalez & Griswold, sp. n.). To facilitate the identification of these taxa, we present a fully illustrated account of the species, comparative diagnoses, descriptions, and an updated key to all Mexican species of Eufriesea. Our analyses using species distribution modelling show an absence of suitable habitat for E. coerulescens in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico, thus favoring the long-distance dispersal hypothesis.

Herein, we document the visitation pattern of bees and explore the relationship of bee body size and nectar availability in weedy populations of C. solstitialis from an urban environment within its native range in northwestern Turkey. Studies were conducted at patches of C. solstitialis in abandoned lots at the Uludağ University near the city of Bursa. A total of 41 species, including honey bees, belonging to five families and 19 genera were recorded. Small megachilid and halictid bee species were the most common visitors. Average nectar standing crop volume per floret was low (0.003–0.117 μL) and did not significantly vary throughout the day.

The minerals measured were aluminum, calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, and some potentially toxic trace elements such as zinc, chromium, nickel, copper and lead. The modified partial least squares (MPLS) regression method was used to develop the NIR calibration model.

We have evaluated natural enemy richness and composition in relation to forest cover in the landscape and distance from the forest, for a Chaco Serrano forest-soybean crop system. Forest contribution to natural enemies on soybean was also investigated, by assessing similarities between forest and crop assemblages, and examining body size of shared enemies in relation to distance from the forest. In nine landscape circles, yellow pan traps were placed in forest and soybean crops (5, 25, 50 and 100m from forest edge), which collected 8041 specimens representing 290 species. Species richness of natural enemies was positively related to forest cover and declined from the forest to the furthermost soybean locations, with both forest cover and its proximity affecting community composition. Also, similarity of forest and crop assemblages increased with forest cover and proximity. Finally, forest-crop shared assemblages showed larger average body size at greater distances from the forest, indicating dispersal limitations on forest contribution to the crop. Our results suggest that forest species are important components of natural enemy communities on soybean, and that both the amount of natural habitat and its proximity may influence agroecosystems.

However, for the sparse-cue environment, the view-based model outperforms the reconstruction-based model.

Deserts are especially sensitive to such effects due to generally low nutrient levels and water availability. Gardens in human settlements in the desert are often a main source of alien plant species that provide ample foraging resources year round. These changes in floral composition and availability may alter pollinator community composition and foraging behaviour, as well as pollination network characteristics. We investigated the effects of desert gardening on pollinator communities and pollination networks in the Jordan Rift Valley (Israel), an arid agro-natural landscape south of the Dead Sea. We studied seasonal diversity patterns of plants and wild bees in natural habitats and in gardens in settlements. Wild bees and blooming plants were sampled from February to July in 2007 and in 2008. We constructed plant-pollinator networks and compared bee communities between the two habitat types along the season. We found that bee abundance was greater in the gardens, and that rarefied bee species richness was greater in the natural habitat. Bee species richness and abundance exhibited contrasting seasonal patterns between habitats. Bee community composition also differed greatly between habitats, and species in the gardens had a generally wider geographical range in comparison to species in the natural habitat. We also found a higher level of generalisation of the pollination network in the gardens compared to the natural habitat, which may indicate a response to a disturbed and unstable environment. We conclude that gardening in deserts although promoting overall bee abundance, negatively affects species richness and changes community composition and network characteristics, with possible implications on the composition of native flora in the natural habitat surrounding the gardens. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","gardening in the desert changes bee communities and pollination network","Conversion of natural habitats to human settlements creates an alternative"

At any one time, a significant proportion of flowers often contain little or no reward. Hence, foraging profitably for floral rewards is problematic and any ability to discriminate between flowers and avoid those that are less rewarding will confer great advantages. In this study, we examine discrimination by foraging bees among flowers of nasturtium, Tropaeolum majus. Bee visitors included carpenter bees, Xylocopa violacea, which were primary nectar robbers; honeybees, Apis mellifera, which either acted as secondary nectar robbers or gathered pollen legitimately and bumblebees, Bombus hortorum, which were the only bees able to gather nectar legitimately. Many flowers were damaged by phytophagous insects. Nectar volume was markedly lower in flowers with damaged petals (which were also likely to be older) and in flowers that had nectar-robbing holes. We test whether bees exhibit selectivity with regards to the individual flowers, which they approach and enter, and whether this selectivity enhances foraging efficiency. The flowers approached (within 2 cm) by A. mellifera and B. hortorum were non-random when compared to the floral population; both species selectively approached un-blemished flowers. They both approached more yellow flowers than would be expected by chance, presumably a reflection of innate colour preferences, for nectar standing crop did not vary according to flower colour. Bees were also more likely to accept (land on) un-blemished flowers. A. mellifera gathering nectar exhibited selectivity with regards to the presence of robbing holes, being more likely to land on robbed flowers (they are not able to feed on un-robbed flowers). That they frequently approached un-robbed flowers suggests that they are not able to detect robbing holes at long-range, so that foraging efficiency may be limited by visual acuity. Nevertheless, by using a combination of long-range and short-range selectivity, nectar-gathering A. mellifera and B. hortorum greatly increased the average reward from the flowers on which they landed (by 68% and 48%, respectively) compared to the average standing crop in the flower population. Overall, our results demonstrate that bees use obvious floral cues (colour and petal blemishes) at long-range, but can switch to using more subtle cues (robbing holes) at close range.

We compare the frequency with which different bee species perform this behaviour. Striking patterns emerge.

Here we examine the population structure of the bumblebee Bombus hortorum in a model island system, the Western Isles of Scotland, using microsatellite markers. Following declines in other species, B. hortorum is the only remaining long-tongued bumblebee species found in much of Europe, and thus it is of particular ecological importance. Our data suggest that populations of B. hortorum in western Scotland exist as distinct genetic clusters occupying groups of nearby islands. Population structuring was higher than for other bumblebee species which have previously been studied in this same island group (Fst = 0. 16). Populations showed significant isolation by distance. This relationship was greatly improved by using circuit theory to allow dispersal rates to differ over different landscape features; as we would predict, sea appears to provide far higher resistance to dispersal than land. Incorporating bathymetry data improved the fit of the model further; populations separated by shallow seas are more genetically similar than those separated by deeper seas. We argue that this probably reflects events following the last ice age when the islands were first colonized by this bee species (8,500-5,000 ybp), when the sea levels were lower and islands separated by shallow channels would have been joined. In the absence of significant gene flow these genetic clusters appear to have since diverged over the following 5,000 years and arguably may now represent locally adapted races, some occurring on single islands. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","population structure, dispersal and colonization history of the garden bumblebee","New methods of analysing genetic data provide powerful tools for"

We have little idea how landscape-scale factors influence the success of wild bumblebee nests over time. Here for the first time we use molecular markers to estimate within-season changes in the numbers of nests. 2. Workers of two bumblebee species were sampled in an arable landscape in late May-June and late July-August, and the numbers of nests represented in each sample were estimated. We compare the methods available to estimate nest number from such samples and conclude that methods which allow for heterogeneity in the probability of capture of nests provide the best fit to our data. Changes in numbers of nests at the two time points were used to infer nest survival. 3. The two bee species appeared to differ markedly in survival over time, with estimates of 45% of nests surviving for Bombus lapidarius and 91% for B. pascuorum. However, our data suggest that the foraging range of B. pascuorum may be greater in late season, which would lead us to overestimate nest survival in this species. Differential survival may also reflect differences in phenology between the two species. 4. The land use class which had the most consistent effects on nest number and survival was gardens; for B. lapidarius, the area of gardens within a 750 and 1000 m radius positively influenced nest survival, while for B. pascuorum, the number of nests in late samples was higher at sites with more gardens within a 500 and 750-m radius. For B. pascuorum, the area of grassland within a 250 and 500-m radius also positively influenced nest number in late samples, probably because this is the preferred nesting habitat for this species. 5. The importance of gardens is in accordance with previous studies which suggest that they now provide a stronghold for bumblebees in an otherwise impoverished agricultural environment; furthermore, our data suggest that the positive influence of gardens on bumblebee populations can spill over at least 1 km into surrounding farmland. 6.

The foraging range of bees is thus a fundamental aspect of their ecology, for it determines the area of the habitat that an individual can exploit (Bronstein 1995; Westrich 1996). Understanding the spatial relationship between nest and food resources allows us to make predictions about colony survival and distribution (Nakamura and Toquenaga 2002; Williams and Kremen 2007). Also, if we are to study the effects of habitat management on bee reproduction (i.e., nest success), the appropriate scale of experimental plots depends on the area over which the occupants of each nest forage (whether it is a single bee or a large group of workers). Similarly, if we are to manage habitats to conserve particular bee species, their foraging range inuences the distribution of forage that is considered optimal. For bees to thrive, presumably their nest sites and forage sites must be sufciently close together that they can economically visit the forage. In the case of social species such as bumble bees with a nest that may persist for many months, the nest must be within foraging range of suitable owers throughout its life. Bee foraging ranges are also important in the consideration of insect-mediated crop pollination. The distance a bee ies will determine which elds are visited within the vicinity of the nest, and also the distances over which pollen might be carried to effect gene ow within and between elds (Damgaard et al. 2008). This is particularly relevant when crops are grown for high seed purity, or when genetically modied crops are grown and the transfer of pollen between neighboring fields or farms is undesirable (Rieger et al. 2002; Cresswell et al. 2002; Damgaard and Kjellsson 2005; Weekes et al. 2005). © 2009 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","foraging range and the spatial distribution of worker bumble bees","All bee species, be they solitary or social, provision their"

This variability has not been adequately explained. In many social insects, size variation is adaptive, with different-sized workers performing different tasks (alloethism). Here we established whether workers of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera; Apidae), exhibit alloethism. We quantified the size of workers engaging in foraging compared to those that remain in the nest, and confirmed that it is the larger bees that tend to forage (X̄ ± SE thorax widths 4.34 ± 0.01 mm for nest bees and 4.93 ± 0.02 mm for foragers). We then investigated whether large bees are better suited to foraging because they are able to transport heavier loads of food back to the nest. Both pollen and nectar loads of returning foragers were measured, demonstrating that larger bees do return with a heavier mass of forage. Foraging trip times were inversely related to bee size when collecting nectar, but were unrelated to bee size for bees collecting pollen. Overall, large bees brought back more nectar per unit time than small bees, but the rate of pollen collection appeared to be unrelated to size. The smallest foragers had a nectar foraging rate close to zero, presumably explaining why foragers tend to be large. Why might larger bees be better at foraging? Various explanations are considered: larger bees are able to forage in cooler conditions, may be able to forage over larger distances, and are perhaps also less vulnerable to predation. Conversely, small workers are presumably cheaper to produce and may be more nimble at within-nest tasks. Further research is needed to assess these possibilities. ©2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The hydrocarbons identified were similar for each species, although there were interspecific differences in the relative amounts of each compound present. The tarsal extracts of all three species comprised complex mixtures of long-chain alkanes and alkenes with between 21 and 29 carbon atoms. When B. terrestris tarsal extracts were applied to flowers and offered to foraging bumblebees of the three species, each exhibited a similar response; concentrated solutions produced a repellent effect, which decreased as the concentration declined. We bioassayed synthetic tricosane (one of the compounds found in the tarsal extracts) at a range of doses to determine whether it gave a similar response. Doses ≥ 10-12 ng/flower resulted in rejection by foraging B. lapidarius. Only when ≤ 10-14 ng was applied did the repellent effect fade. We bioassayed four other synthetic compounds found in tarsal extracts and a mixture of all five compounds to determine which were important in inducing a repellent effect in B. lapidarius workers. All induced repellency but the strength of the response varied; heneicosane was most repellent while tricosene was least repellent.

Both species exhibited marked floral constancy when foraging in the mixed-plant community. Because all groups of pollinating insect so far examined exhibit constancy at least under some circumstances, we suggest that this is the predominant strategy used by pollinators and that there is probably a common explanation. Neither syrphid species exhibited constancy to different color morphs within a plant species, in contrast to previously published studies of Hymenoptera foraging among polymorphic flowers, which all describe positive frequency-dependent selection. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. We argue that constancy in these syrphids is unlikely to result from learning constraints on handling ability, currently the most widely accepted explanation for flower constancy, because they forage primarily for pollen which is easily located in most flowers they visit.","flower constancy in the hoverflies episyrphus balteatus (degeer) and syrphus","The causes and consequences of flower constancy have been the"

This is commonly attributed to the decline in floral resources that has resulted from an intensification in farming practices. Here we assess growth of nests of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, in habitats providing different levels of floral resources. Experimental nests were placed out in conventional farmland, in farmland with flower-rich conservation measures and in suburban areas. Nests gained weight more quickly and attained a larger final size in suburban areas compared to elsewhere. The diversity of pollens gathered by bees was highest in suburban areas, and lowest in conventional farmland. Nests in suburban areas were also more prone to attack by the specialist bumblebee parasite Aphomia sociella, suggesting that this moth is more abundant in suburban areas than elsewhere. Overall, our results demonstrate that gardens provide a greater density and diversity of floral resources than farmland, and probably support larger populations of B. terrestris. Contrary to expectation, schemes deployed to enhance farmland biodiversity appear to have little measurable impact on nest growth of this bumblebee species. We argue that B. terrestris probably forage over a larger scale than that on which farms are managed, so that nest growth is determined by the management of a large number of neighbouring farms, 7 not just that in which the nest is located.","colony growth of the bumblebee, bombus terrestris, in improved and","Many bumblebee species are declining at a rapid rate in"

Increasing urbanisation is often cited as a cause of declining biodiversity, but for bumblebees there is evidence that urban populations of some species such as Bombus terrestris L. may be more dense than those found in agricultural landscapes, perhaps because gardens provide plentiful floral resources and nesting opportunities. 2. Here we examine the influence of urbanisation on the prevalence of the main protozoan parasites of bumblebees in west central Scotland. We would expect transmission rates and prevalence of parasites to be higher in high density host populations, all else being equal. 3. Workers of two bee species, B. terrestris and B. pascuorum, were sampled over a 45-day period in mid to late summer, and parasites were detected in faeces and via dissection. A comparison of the two methods suggests that faecal sampling is considerably less sensitive than dissection, failing to detect infection in 27.8%, 55.1%, and 80% of cases of infection with the parasites Crithidia bombi, Nosema bombi, and Apicystis bombi, respectively. 4. For all three parasites, broad patterns of prevalence were similar, with prevalence tending to increase with urbanisation in B. terrestris but not in B. pascuorum. The different patterns of seasonal prevalence in the two bee species suggest that intraspecific transmission is more important that interspecific transmission. 5. Our observation of greater parasite prevalence among B. terrestris in urban compared with rural areas suggests that urban habitats may present greater opportunities for parasite transmission. Greater bee densities in urban areas may be the driving factor; however, further study is still needed. For example, differences in disease prevalence between habitats could be driven by differences in the types and abundance of flowers that are available, or in exposure to environmental stressors.","influence of urbanisation on the prevalence of protozoan parasites of","1.

Fragments (1.5 × 1.5 m) were isolated by a 5-m wide strip of frequently mown vegetation while the control plots were situated in the adjacent undisturbed vegetation. The most common pollinator, the bumblebee Bombus veteranus (Apidae), visited fragments 53.7% less frequently than control plots. Furthermore, a change in foraging behaviour of Bombus veteranus was observed. In fragments the bumblebees visited more inflorescences, flew longer total visiting distances and the visiting time per patch tended to be higher than in control plots. The distribution of angles between arrival and departure direction (turning angles) differed from a uniform distribution in fragments but not in control plots. The increased directionality of bumblebee flight might be due to a decrease in floral rewards. Our results show that small-scale habitat fragmentation can affect plant pollination at two levels both relevant for plant fitness. First, lower visitation rates indicate a limitation of pollinators which might result in reduced seed set of the pollinated plant. Second, changes in pollinator behaviour might reduce pollen dispersal among flowers, increase inbreeding and hence reduce genetic variability in populations of this bumblebee pollinated plant. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Flowers offer a wealth of signals, from odors acting as distant attractants, to colors eliciting approximation and feeding responses, to textures guiding feeding responses toward a reservoir of nectar. Thus, animals use different signals in the regulation of particular motor outputs. Nevertheless, the use of these sensory signals can be user-specific (e.g. species, motivation, experience, learning) as well as context-dependent (e.g. spatiotemporal patterns of stimulation, availability of signals, multimodal integration). The crepuscular/nocturnal hawkmoths Manduca sexta experience a wide range of illuminations during their foraging activity, which raises the question of how these environmental changes might affect the use of two important floral signals, odor and visual display. In a flight cage, we explored the use of these signals under different illuminances. Under conditions of starlight and crescent moonlight, moths showed very low levels of responsiveness to unscented feeders (artificial flowers). However, responsiveness was recovered either by increasing illumination, or by offering olfactory signals. Additionally, we recorded a bias toward white over blue feeders under dim conditions, which disappeared with increasing illumination. We discuss how this kind of experimental manipulation may provide insights to the study of how innate behavioral programs, and their underlying neural substrates, overcome selective forces imposed by the uncertainty of natural, ever-changing environments.","influence of ambient illumination on the use of olfactory and","As a goal-directed behavior, foraging for nectar functions on the"

To reverse these effects, flowering habitat enhancements are designed to provide supplemental nutritional resources for wild bees and are particularly important when few resources are available in the surrounding landscape. Yet, it is not known whether or how habitat enhancements support bee populations under varying landscape contexts. Body size is a morphological trait that is strongly linked to foraging ability, immune function, and fitness in bees. Landscape simplification has been associated with size declines across bee taxa and smaller body size can be an early indicator of environmental stress. To determine whether the negative effects of landscape simplification on body size can be improved by adding floral resources to farm landscapes, we measured the body size of 10 wild bee species collected at 70 sites with or without habitat enhancements in Michigan and New York. Bees were collected at sites with varying amounts of agriculture in the surrounding landscape, allowing us to test whether morphological responses to enhancements are affected by landscape simplification. Half of the bee species measured exhibited declining body size across the landscape gradient. Among these species, declines were buffered by the presence of habitat enhancements suggesting this response is the result of improved nutrition, reduced need for long-distance foraging, enhanced recruitment of larger individuals or a combination of these mechanisms. Declines in body size were strongest in both the smallest and the largest species. Large and medium sized species exhibited the greatest response to flowering habitat enhancements. Synthesis and applications. At sites with high agricultural cover, we observed intraspecific body size declines among many species; however, we did not observe decreased body size in any species at sites with a flowering habitat enhancement. Therefore, our findings suggest that the presence of flowering habitat enhancements can support wild bees experiencing stress from intensively managed agricultural landscapes across multiple cropping systems and regions. © 2019 The Authors.

But despite concerns, there have been no empirical studies investigating the impact of A. manicatum on North American pollinators. Therefore, across a two-year study, we monitored foraging behavior and fitness of the common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) in response to A. manicatum presence. We found that B. impatiens avoided foraging near A. manicatum in both years; but despite this resource exclusion, we found no evidence of fitness consequences for B. impatiens.

For the first time, B. terrestris nest structures, and their contents such as larvae, pupae and eggs, were non-invaseively viewed and assessed. This technique will enable future experiments to take morphological measurements of egg, larval, and pupal development over time. Moreover, combining these measurements with measures of food-storage will provide a good assessment of colony health. The method will also allow tracking of individually marked adults, to monitor their behaviour and help gain a better understanding of the processes involved in the global declines of B. terrestris, which will in turn promote better management of these valuable pollinators. © This is an open access paper.

When colonies were exposed at 5 different E fields (7, 5.5, 4.1, 1.8, and 0.65–0.85 kV/m) at incremental distances from the line, different thresholds for biologic effects were obtained. Hive net weights showed significant dose‐related lags at the following exposures: 7 kV/m, one week; 5.5 kV/m, 2 weeks; and 4.1 kV/m, 11 weeks. The two lowest exposure groups had normal weight after 25 weeks. Abnormal propolization of hive entrances did not occur below 4.1 kV/m. Queen loss occurred in 6 of 7 colonies at 7 kV/m and 1 of 7 at 5.5 kV/m, but not below. Foraging rates were significantly lower only at 7 and 5.5 kV/m.

Surprisingly, they often transfer to more than one receiver (published values range from 1.9 to 2.7). Several adaptive hypotheses have been proposed to explain why multiple transfer occurs. One hypothesis, information improvement, states that multiple transfer arises as an adaptive forager-driven process. Foragers use the delay in finding a receiver to assess the relative work capacities of foragers and receivers, performing recruitment dances when appropriate. Multiple transferring improves their delay information. We used a stochastic simulation model to investigate the non-adaptive partial loads hypothesis. We determined the extent to which partial crop loads and receiver filling and emptying rules (i.e. how much nectar to accept before leaving the transfer area) can cause multiple transfer. As many as 1.9 nectar transfers per returning forager were generated within biologically realistic parameter space. We suggest that much multiple transfer arises as a non-adaptive consequence of partitioning nectar foraging between foragers and receivers, but that this will also result in foragers having better information about the relative work capacities of foragers and receivers as a useful consequence. We suggest that the number of transfers caused by partial loads could also be increased by an adaptive forager-driven effort to improve their information concerning the balance of foragers and receivers and we outline a framework wherein the information improvement hypothesis can be directly tested. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Across Europe, wildflower seed mixtures are widely sown on farmland to encourage pollinators, but the extent to which key pollinator groups such as solitary bees exploit and benefit from these resources is unclear. We used high-throughput sequencing of 164 pollen samples extracted from the brood cells of six common cavity-nesting solitary bee species (Osmia bicornis, Osmia caerulescens, Megachile versicolor, Megachile ligniseca, Megachile centuncularis and Hylaeus confusus) which are widely distributed across the UK and Europe. We documented their pollen use across 19 farms in southern England, UK, revealing their forage plants and examining the structure of their pollen transport networks. Of the 32 plant species included currently in sown wildflower mixes, 15 were recorded as present within close foraging range of the bees on the study farms, but only Ranunculus acris L. was identified within the pollen samples. Rosa canina L. was the most commonly found of the 23 plant species identified in the pollen samples, suggesting that, in addition to providing a nesting resource for Megachile leafcutter bees, it may be an important forage plant for these species. Higher levels of connectance and nestedness were characteristic of pollen transport networks on farms with abundant floral resources, which may increase resilience to species loss. Our data suggest that plant species promoted currently by agri-environment schemes are not optimal for solitary bee foraging. If a diverse community of pollinators is to be supported on UK and European farmland, additional species such as R. canina should be encouraged to meet the foraging requirements of solitary bees. © 2018 The Authors.

The view that round dances and waggle dances are distinct recruitment signals has been revised in light of the finding that distance and direction information are encoded (albeit imprecisely) in round dances. It has remained unclear, however, whether dance followers can use the location information in round dances. In the present study, we looked at recruitment to nearby food sources and found that dance followers can use the directional information in the dances advertising these food sources. Directional bias in recruitment was found for food sources as close as 5. m from the hive. Controls for effects of assembly pheromone and bee presence at the advertised food sources indicate that these factors play a minimal role, relative to dance information, in producing the directional recruitment.

We investigated long-term patterns in the response of bees to habitat restoration by sampling bee communities along a 26-year chronosequence of restored tallgrass prairie in north-central Illinois, U.S.A. Specifically, we examined how bee communities changed over time since restoration in terms of (1) abundance and richness, (2) community composition, and (3) the two components of beta diversity, one-to-one species replacement, and changes in species richness. Bee abundance and raw richness increased with restoration age from the low level of the pre-restoration (agricultural) sites to the target level of the remnant prairie within the first 2-3 years after restoration, and these high levels were maintained throughout the entire restoration chronosequence. Bee community composition of the youngest restored sites differed from that of prairie remnants, but 5-7 years post-restoration the community composition of restored prairie converged with that of remnants. Landscape context, particularly nearby wooded land, was found to affect abundance, rarefied richness, and community composition. Partitioning overall beta diversity between sites into species replacement and richness effects revealed that the main driver of community change over time was the gradual accumulation of species, rather than one-to-one species replacement. At the spatial and temporal scales we studied, we conclude that prairie restoration efforts targeting plants also successfully restore bee communities.","wild bee community change over a 26-year chronosequence of restored","Restoration efforts often focus on plants, but additionally require the"

Virus infection induces changes in plant volatile emission profiles, and this can make plants more attractive to insect herbivores, such as aphids, that act as viral vectors. However, it is unknown if virus-induced alterations in volatile production affect plant-pollinator interactions. We found that volatiles emitted by cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-infected tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and Arabidopsis thaliana plants altered the foraging behaviour of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Virus-induced quantitative and qualitative changes in blends of volatile organic compounds emitted by tomato plants were identified by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. Experiments with a CMV mutant unable to express the 2b RNA silencing suppressor protein and with Arabidopsis silencing mutants implicate microRNAs in regulating emission of pollinator-perceivable volatiles. In tomato, CMV infection made plants emit volatiles attractive to bumblebees. Bumblebees pollinate tomato by ‘buzzing’ (sonicating) the flowers, which releases pollen and enhances self-fertilization and seed production as well as pollen export. Without buzz-pollination, CMV infection decreased seed yield, but when flowers of mock-inoculated and CMV-infected plants were buzz-pollinated, the increased seed yield for CMV-infected plants was similar to that for mock-inoculated plants. Increased pollinator preference can potentially increase plant reproductive success in two ways: i) as female parents, by increasing the probability that ovules are fertilized; ii) as male parents, by increasing pollen export. Mathematical modeling suggested that over a wide range of conditions in the wild, these increases to the number of offspring of infected susceptible plants resulting from increased pollinator preference could outweigh underlying strong selection pressures favoring pathogen resistance, allowing genes for disease susceptibility to persist in plant populations. We speculate that enhanced pollinator service for infected individuals in wild plant populations might provide mutual benefits to the virus and its susceptible hosts. © 2016 Groen et al.","virus infection of plants alters pollinator preference: a payback for","Plant volatiles play important roles in attraction of certain pollinators"

Although cold-narcosis is widely regarded as non-invasive and non-damaging for neural structures, it has been shown that it can influence the bees’ subsequent behaviour in various ways. While we do have some understanding of the effect of cold treatment on handling stress, memory, locomotion and foraging in bees, it remains to be tested whether their defensive behaviour is affected. We investigated the response of foragers to a leg pinch applied before, during or after cold-anaesthesia. As expected, bees pinched at the hive entrance all responded defensively, while anaesthetised bees showed no response. When the pinch was applied after the bees recovered from cold-narcosis, all individuals were defensive, suggesting that previous cooling had not impaired nociception. We then subjected two groups of bees to a continuous pinch, commencing either before or during cold anaesthesia. Interestingly, most of these bees did not show defensive behaviour once awake, even though the clip was still attached to their leg. Chilling only lead to a diminished defensive response if the nociceptive stimulus was continuous rather than momentary, which suggests that it is not the chilling on its own, but the duration of the pinch in combination with cold narcosis that is critical. Our findings highlight the subtle ways in which treatment of insects during narcosis can affect their subsequent behaviour, and point to new ways in which narcosis can interact with sensory perception and adaptation. © 2018, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).","effects of cold anaesthesia on the defensive behaviour of honeybees","Cold anaesthesia is commonly used to temporarily immobilise honeybees and"

We studied a dimorphic population located in the southern “Wienerwald”-region to obtain frequencies of inter- and intra-morph pollinator switches. Pollinia were marked using dye powder to observe pollen flow, i.e. the spatial distribution of pollen, pollen export and deposition (i.e. male and female reproductive success) as well as the transport distances from donator to receptor plants. For analysing the switching behaviour of pollinators, we labelled yellow- and purple-flowering individuals morph-specifically using two different dye colours. In our study system, yellow-flowering plants were dominant (70% in 2006; 67% in 2014). We labelled 582 pollinia from yellow- and 239 from purple-flowering individuals reflecting the yellow-dominance (71%). In total, 473 marked pollinia were exported, of which 72.3% originated from yellow flowers. We found that movements of pollinators from yellow to yellow (YY) flowers dominate (93 of all 155 deposits of labelled pollen) the four possible pollination events by far. Even given the dominance of yellow-flowering plants in our study population, only 70 respective events (out of 155) would have been expected, if switching behaviour was by chance. Therefore, the assumption that pollinators alternate randomly between colour morphs was not supported by our results. The longest pollen transport distance observed was 237m. Moreover, 135 manually conducted cross-pollinations on 47 individuals were evaluated: seed viability analyses indicated no differences between the four possible crosses.

Orchis boryi is food deceptive and obligatorily insect pollinated. Primary pollinators were Apis mellifera and Bombus spp., which foraged on rewarding plant species nearby and visited O. boryi in between. To analyse floral colour similarity among rewarding plants and O. boryi as perceived by bees, a model of bee colour vision was employed. For each food plant an index was calculated that described the probability of a bee foraging on it to subsequently choose an orchid flower. This choice probability correlated to colour distance according to the model of bee colour vision, indicating that bees chose the deceptive orchid more frequently if they foraged on more similarly coloured species. At different sites different plant species served as models. Bees foraging on food plants from which a high choice rate to the orchid was observed visited the orchid less often after approaching it than other bees, which is likely to reflect avoidance learning. In general, the pollination syndrome appears to be a generalized form of Batesian mimicry, in which similarity to rewarding plants determines reproductive success. As expected by negative density-dependent selection, individual fruit set and pollinia export rate correlated negatively with orchid density, but were unaffected by food plant density, orchid frequency, individual variation of labellum colour, labellum size, or mouth width of the flowers. © 2001 The Linnean Society of London.","colour similarity to rewarding model plants affects pollination in a","We studied the pollination of Orchis boryi at five different"

Location Peru, continental Ecuador and Galapagos. Methods We sequenced the nuclear ribosomal ITS and two plastid regions, ndhF and ndhF-rpL32, to infer the origin of Galvezia and patterns of colonization to and across the Galapagos archipelago, based on Bayesian inference and statistical parsimony analyses. To investigate genetic diversity and differentiation within G.leucantha, we screened the genome of six populations and obtained 194 AFLP fingerprints. Autogamy tests and pollination network analyses were performed to evaluate the colonization potential and to investigate the structure of the pollinators' assemblage of Galvezia. Results Relationships of seven nucleotide-substitution haplotypes and 11 nucleotide-substitution ribotypes of Galvezia revealed monophyly for the Galapagos species. Dating estimates indicated divergence of the insular Galvezia lineage in the Middle-Upper Pleistocene (0.66-0.09Ma). In addition, distribution of genotypes (seven haplotypes, eight ribotypes) across the three continental species showed geographical differentiation, while low differentiation and distribution of G.leucantha.

Flight behaviour was measured in three dimensions as total flying distance, mean velocity, variability of velocity, maximum acceleration, maximum deceleration, percentage of time spent accelerating, and displacement from a straight line path between flowers. Loss of wing area had surprisingly little effect on flight behaviour. Viewed multivariately, bees with low asymmetry and low loss of mean area, or with high asymmetry and high loss of mean area, differed from the other three treatment groups. When bees were burdened with both high asymmetry and high loss of wing area, their between-flower flight path was less direct.

Thus, we compared the migration patterns of European Bee-eaters Merops apiaster from two established western (n = 5) and eastern (n = 6) breeding populations in Europe, with those from a newly founded northern population (n = 19). We aimed to relate the breeding populations to the two known non-breeding clusters in Africa, and to test for similarities of migration routes and timing between the old and new populations. Western Bee-eaters used the western flyway to destinations in West Africa; the eastern birds uniformly headed south to southern African non-breeding sites, confirming a complete separation in time and space between these long-established populations. The recently founded northern population, however, also used a western corridor, but crossed the Mediterranean further east than the western population and overwintered mainly in a new non-breeding area in southern Congo/northern Angola. The migration routes and the new non-breeding range overlapped only slightly with the western, but not with the eastern, population. In contrast, migration phenology appeared to differ between the western and both the northern and the eastern populations, with tracked birds from the western population migrating 2-4 weeks earlier. The northern population thus shares some spatial traits with western Bee-eaters, but similar phenology only with eastern population.

Both juveniles and adults are central place foragers that search for food at night and return to the same nest each morning. This study examines the homing abilities of juveniles of an undescribed species of gryllacridid from Western Australia. Juveniles were placed in a simple maze, which consisted of two chambers, one containing the nest and the other empty, linked by wide glass tubes to a central chamber containing food. The food was placed in this chamber with a consistent orientation relative to the exit tubes leading to the nest and empty chambers. Juveniles appeared to learn which chamber contained their nest and thereafter ignored the route towards the empty chamber. By exchanging the connecting glass tubes, it could be established that juvenile crickets were not using chemical trails to find their home. The positions of the empty and nest chambers with respect to the central chamber were exchanged and, in a separate manipulation, the spatial configuration of the food in the central chamber was also changed. Both manipulations resulted in a decrease in successful returns to the nest chamber, the former because the nest had been relocated, the latter presumably because the spatial arrangement of items within the food chamber now presented orientation cues, which led to the empty chamber. Furthermore, juveniles were able to estimate distance travelled, despite the absence of chemical or visual cues.

The diversity of bee species in rural landscapes is influenced by the type of landscape features present, and by land-use and management practices. A key challenge is to understand and predict how species vary across the landscape; and the role of functional traits in determining compositional patterns. We systematically sampled wild bees in four types of landscape feature - open farmland, scattered farmland trees, roadside vegetation and streamside vegetation - in rural landscapes in southern Australia. Landscapes were selected to represent wooded or non-wooded combinations of these site types (e.g. roadside vegetation with or without trees), embedded in farmland with different land-uses (e.g. cropping, grazing). The species richness and abundance of bees was greater at sites containing little or no tree cover; and the cumulative richness of species was greater for tree-less sites than for those with trees. In contrast, species evenness was greatest in wooded site types, indicating these were less dominated by abundant generalist species. Open farmland and treeless road-sides had greater functional diversity (based on species traits) than wooded site types. Strong species trait associations were more numerous with open parts of the landscape, reflecting the greater functional diversity of open site types. These results suggest that a suite of the extant bee fauna can exploit large-scale transformation from former extensively wooded ecosystems to open agricultural landscapes. However, not all species are able to exploit modified landscapes and may disappear with further loss of wooded vegetation. Trait-based approaches provide insight into how changes in landscape pattern affect the bee fauna. Failure to adequately cater for multiple functional groups of bees across all landscape features could mean a substantial loss in species that rely on more natural cover, thus affecting ecosystem function.","the response of wild bees to tree cover and rural","Worldwide, bees have an important role in ecosystem function and"

This study tested the hypothesis that bumblebees foraging in English urban gardens preferentially visited sympatric Palaearctic-range plants over species originating outside their native range.MethodsTwenty-seven surveys of flower availability and bumblebee visitation (Bombus spp.) were conducted over a 3-month summer period. Plants were categorized according to whether they were native British, Palaearctic or non-Palaearctic in origin. A phylogeny of the 119 plant species recorded was constructed and the relationship between floral abundance and the frequency of pollinator visits investigated by means of phylogenetically independent contrasts. Differentiation in utilization of plant species by the five bumblebee species encountered was investigated using niche overlap analyses.Key ResultsThere was conflicting evidence for preferential use of native-range Palaearctic plant species by bumblebees depending on which plants were included in the analysis. Evidence was also found for niche partitioning between species based on respective preferences for native and non-native biogeographical range plants. Two bumblebees (Bombus terrestris and B. pratorum) concentrated their foraging activity on non-Palaearctic plants, while two others (B. hortorum and B. pascourum) preferred Palaearctic species.ConclusionsThe long-running debate about the value of native and non-native garden plants to pollinators probably stems from a failure to properly consider biogeographical overlap between plant and pollinator ranges. Gardeners can encourage pollinators without consideration of plant origin or bias towards 'local' biogeographical species. However, dietary specialist bumblebees seem to prefer plants sympatric with their own biogeographical range and, in addition to the cultivation of these species in gardens, provision of native non-horticultural ('weed') species may also be important for pollinator conservation. © 2014 The Author.","going native? flower use by bumblebees in english urban gardens","Background and AimsAlthough urban gardens provide opportunities for pollinators in"

In this study, we investigated the value of hedgerows as foraging habitat for native bees in mosaics of small-scale agriculture and natural vegetation in two riparian landscapes in southeast Arizona, USA. In the summers of 2002 and 2003, we surveyed bees and flowers in four habitats: hedgerows, agricultural fields, woodlots, and native woodland. We asked: (1) How do hedgerows compare to other available habitats in bee abundance and species richness? (2) How does bee species composition in hedgerows compare to species composition in agricultural fields and woodland? (3) How do flower resources in hedgerows compare to those in fields and woodland? We found that hedgerows were attractive foraging habitat for native bees, especially in early summer, when hedgerows tended to have higher species richness than other agricultural or natural habitats. Cumulative species richness was highest in agricultural fields, although cumulative species richness did not significantly differ among fields, hedgerows, and woodland. While bee faunas overlapped among habitats, bee assemblages in hedgerows were more similar to those in woodland than to those in fields. The hedgerow herbaceous flora was roughly intermediate to that of fields and woodland; hedgerows also supported high densities of woodland-characteristic shrubs. These flowering shrubs were important in attracting bees that were otherwise uncommon in the landscape, including some species that are potentially valuable pollinators of agricultural crops.

Many current theoretical models focus on the effect of floral resources' density on the net outcome of these indirect plantplant interactions, often neglecting the identity of plant species in the communities and especially the species' spatial pattern. To fill this gap, we created a spatially explicit model whose goal was to study the interplay between relative densities and spatial distribution patterns of two plant species differing in their attractiveness for pollinators. Since theory predicts that pollinator behaviour strongly governs the outcome of pollination, we allowed the pollinators to systematically change their plant preferences based on their foraging experience. Thus the interplay between density and spatial patterns of plants was tested over a continuum of behaviours from specialists to generalists. Our most striking finding was that reproductive success of the less attractive species was affected in an opposite way by spatial patterns depending on whether the species had relatively low or high densities. Namely, when the less attractive species was highly abundant, its survival was higher when aggregated in large monospecific patches than when uniformly distributed. On the other hand, when the attractive species was more abundant, the less attractive species survived better when uniformly distributed. These results were consistent as long as the scale of the plant spatial aggregation was similar to or larger than the pollinators' detection range. Our results suggest that aggregated plant spatial patterns manipulate pollinator behaviour by trapping them within monospecific patches. This effect was sufficiently strong to enhance the survival of a competitively inferior species and hence to act in a way similar to the more familiar niche or temporal separation among plant species.","effects of spatial patterns on the pollination success of a","Plant individuals rely on pollinator services for their reproduction and"

High configurational landscape heterogeneity due to small fields and a high amount of field boundaries is hypothesized to enhance farmland biodiversity. Here, we investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming in large- vs. small-scale agricultural landscapes on wild bee communities and their floral resources to improve conservation schemes for pollinators. We sampled bees in Central Germany at the field boundaries of 18 pairs of conventionally and organically managed winter wheat fields along the former iron curtain using pan traps and trap nests. Around traps, we surveyed species richness and flower cover of insect-pollinated forbs. Compared to conventional farming, organic farming was related to higher insect-pollinated forb species richness and flower cover in the field boundaries, presumably due to the lack of herbicide use. Interestingly, small-scale agriculture did not counteract the loss of floral resources under conventional management, as the difference to organic management was even larger in Western small-scale agriculture. Organic farming, but not small-scale agriculture, enhanced species richness of solitary bees, which is in line with their small home ranges. In contrast, bumblebees benefitted only from small-scale agriculture, which matches with their high dispersal ability. Despite similar levels of abundance and diversity of trap-nesting bees in the two landscape types, brood cell parasitism was also higher in small-scale agriculture. Both organic farming and small-scale agriculture directly and indirectly supported different groups of wild bees, suggesting long-term benefits for conservation.

We investigated the relationship between waggle-phase duration and crop volume in foragers (both dancers and dance followers) leaving the hive. Our findings indicate that these variables were positively correlated in the two types of bee, suggesting that they were able to adjust the amount of food that they carry depending on the distance to a food source. We also found that dance followers left the hive with a larger amount of honey than dancers. We suggest two possible explanations: (1) dance followers have less information about the location of the food source than dancers, who have a better knowledge of the surrounding area; or (2) honeybees lack a precise calibration method for estimating energy needs from waggle-run duration. The effect of foraging experience was confirmed: bees decreased their honey load at departure with repeated trips to a sugar-syrup feeder. Honeybees showed a different pattern of change when the feeder provided soybean flour as a pollen substitute, possibly because honeybees use honey not only as an energy source but also as ""glue"" to form ""balls"" of pollen on their hind legs.

The crop contents of bees foraging on crape myrtle Lagerstroemia indica, which has no nectary, were larger than those foraging on nectar from other sources, confirming a previous finding that pollen foragers carry glue in addition to fuel honey from the hive.

Further analysis revealed that the sugar concentration of the crop load increased significantly with waggle duration, an indicator of food-source distance, in both groups of foragers. Crop volume also increased with waggle duration. The results support our argument that foragers use concentrated nectar when the need for sugar is high and suggest that they precisely adjust the amount of sugar in the crop by altering both volume and nectar concentrations. We also investigated the impact of the area where foragers receive nectar on the crop load concentration at departure. Although nectar and pollen foragers tend to load nectar at different areas in the nest, area did not have a significant effect on crop load concentration.

Dancing pollen foragers increased honey at departure with the size of collected pollen loads. Analysis of the waggle-run duration revealed that the size of pollen load affected the rate of increase of honey at departure with food source distance in dancers. The increase rate was significantly higher in dancers that had returned to the hive with large pollen loads versus nectar-collecting dancers, but not in those with smaller pollen loads. The higher increase rate may reflect additional fuel carried for the return trip in pollen-foraging specialists that do not use collected nectar as fuel. Although honey carried by departing dance followers also increased significantly with the size of pollen load carried by dancers, the adjustment was different from that of dancers.

This weak self-compatibility and a positive relation between the percentage of seeds set by outcrossed plants and the distance between pollen donor and recipient plants indicate that this population could be susceptible to inbreeding depression. Limited resources for seed development apparently constrained maximal seed production, based on low seed set (40.6%) by hand-pollinated plants and positive correlations for these plants between plant size and the number and size of seeds set. In contrast, naturally-pollinated plants set a smaller proportion of their ovules, suggesting that limited pollinator service reduced the quantity of seeds produced in this population. Free-foraging bees usually removed more than half of the available pollen in a single visit, so that individual plants probably have few opportunities to disseminate their pollen. Even though sexually reproductive ramets produce only a single flower per year, less than a third of variation in floral morphology is associated with variation in plant size. Within the flower, the sizes of some closely associated structures, such as the style and ovary, and the anthers and filaments, vary essentially independently of one another.

Mobility is believed to allow species to mediate competitive interactions quickly and thus highly mobile species may appear randomly assembled in local communities. At larger scales, however, biogeographical processes could cause communities to be either phylogenetically clustered or even. Using phylogenetic community analysis we examined patterns of relatedness and trait similarity in communities of bumble bees (Bombus) across spatial scales comparing: local communities to regional pools, regional communities to continental pools and the continental community to a global species pool. Species composition and data on tongue lengths, a key foraging trait, were used to test patterns of relatedness and trait similarity across scales. Although expected to exhibit limiting similarity, local communities were clustered both phenotypically and phylogenetically. Larger spatial scales were also found to have more phylogenetic clustering but less trait clustering. While patterns of relatedness in mobile species have previously been suggested to exhibit less structure in local communities and to be less clustered than immobile species, we suggest that mobility may actually allow communities to have more similar species that can simply limit direct competition through mobility. © 2013 Harmon-Threatt, Ackerly.","filtering across spatial scales: phylogeny, biogeography and community structure in","Despite the expansion of phylogenetic community analysis to understand community"

African and European honeybees (EHB) hybridize, but with time, tropical and subtropical American environments have become dominated by AHB that exhibit only 20-35% genetic contribution from western European bees, and a predominance of African behavioral and physiological traits. EHB persist in temperate environments. Clines between AHB and EHB exist in ecotones of South and Central America, and are forming in North America. What individual-level genetic, behavioral and physiological traits determine the relative success of the AHB as an invader in the neotropics, and of the EHB in temperate areas? Preference for pollen versus nectar may be an important trait mediating these ecological trade-offs, as preference for pollen enhances nutrient intake and brood production for the AHB in the tropics, while a relative preference for nectar enhances honey stores and winter survival for EHB. AHB exhibit morphological (higher thorax-to-body mass ratios) and physiological (higher thorax-specific metabolic rates) traits that may improve flight capacity, dispersal, mating success and foraging intake. Enhanced winter longevity, linked with higher hemolymph vitellogenin levels, may be a key factor improving winter survival of EHB. Data from South America and distributions of AHB in the southwestern United States suggest that AHB-EHB hybrids will extend 200 km north of regions with a January maximal temperatures of 15-16°C.

Some honeybee species engage in visually apparent behavior, walking in a figure-eight pattern inside their dark hives. It has been suggested that sounds play an important role in this dance language, even though a variety of wing vibration sounds are produced by honeybee behaviors in hives. It has been shown that dances emit sounds primarily at about 250-300 Hz, which is in the same frequency range as honeybees' flight sounds. Thus the exact mechanism whereby honeybees attract nestmates using waggle dances in such a dark and noisy hive is as yet unclear. In this study, we used a flight simulator in which honeybees were attached to a torque meter in order to analyze the component of bees' orienting response caused only by sounds, and not by odor or by vibrations sensed by their legs. We showed using single sound localization that honeybees preferred sounds around 265 Hz. Furthermore, according to sound discrimination tests using sounds of the same frequency, honeybees preferred rhythmic sounds. Our results demonstrate that frequency and rhythmic components play a complementary role in localizing dance sounds.

However, little evidence is available on how and to what extent the pollen carryover affects the pollen-donor composition and on which insect taxa are effective outcross-pollen transporters under field conditions. In this study, we explored roles of foraging behavior of insect pollinators on pollen-donor composition and subsequent reproductive success in a woody plant. Methods We performed paternity analyses based on microsatellite genotyping of individual pollen grains found on diurnal pollinators (i.e., bumblebee, small bee, fly, small beetle, and honeybee) visiting Castanea crenata trees. Results The outcross-pollen rate was highest in bumblebees (66%), followed by small bees (35%), flies (31%), and small beetles (18%). The effective number of pollen donors, representing pollen carryover, was greater in bumblebees (9.71) than in flies (3.40), small bees (3.32), and small beetles (3.06). The high percentages of pollen from outside the plot on bumblebees (65.4%) and flies (71.2%) compared to small bees (35.3%) and small beetles (13.5%) demonstrated their longer pollen dispersal distances.

Invertebrate ichnofossils, preserving the most environmentally and climatically sensitive in situ behavior of Morrison organisms, are in nearly all outcrops. Terrestrial ichnofossils record biotic processes in soil formation, indicating soil moisture and water-table levels. Freshwater ichnofossils preserve evidence of water depth, salinity, and seasonality of water bodies. Ichnofossils, categorized as epiterraphilic, terraphilic, hygrophilic, and hydrophilic (new terms), reflect the moisture regime where they were constructed. The ichnofossils are vertically zoned with respect to physical, chemical, and biological factors in the environment that controlled their distribution and abundance, and are expressed as surficial, shallow, intermediate, and deep. The sedimentologic, stratigraphic, and geographic distribution of Morrison ichnofossils reflects the environmental and climatic variations across the basin through time. Marginal-marine, tidal to brackish-water ichnofossils are mainly restricted to the Windy Hill Member. Very large to small termite nests dominate the Salt Wash Member. Similar size ranges of ant nests dominate the Brushy Basin Member. Soil bee nests dominate in the Salt Wash, decreasing in abundance through the Brushy Basin. Deeper and larger insect nests indicate more seasonal distribution of precipitation and rainfall. Shallower and smaller insect nests indicate either dry or wet substrate conditions depending on the nest architecture and paleopedogenic and sedimentologic character of the substrate. Trace-fossil indicators of flowing or standing water conditions are dominant in the Tidwell Member and in fluvial sandstones of the Salt Wash and Brushy Basin Members. Large communities of perennial, freshwater bivalve traces are abundant in the Tidwell and Brushy Basin Members but to a lesser extent in the Salt Wash Member. Shallow crayfish burrows, indicating a water-table level close to the surface (< 1 m), are restricted to channel bank and proximal alluvial deposits in the Salt Wash, Recapture, and Brushy Basin Members. Sauropod, theropod, pterosaur, and other vertebrate tracks occur throughout the Morrison Formation associated with alluvial, lacustrine, and transitional-marine shoreline deposits. Ichnofossils and co-occurring paleosols in the Morrison reflect the local and regional paleohydrologic settings, which record the annual soil moisture budget and were largely controlled by the climate in the basin. Contributions to near-surface biologic systems by groundwater from distant sources were minor, except where the water table perennially, seasonally, or ephemerally intersected the ground-surface. The Jurassic Morrison Formation in the southern portion of the basin experienced a mosaic of seasonal climates that varied from a drier (Tidwell/Windy Hill deposition) to a wetter (lower and middle Salt Wash deposition) and slightly drier (upper Salt Wash deposition) tropical wet-dry climate, returning to a wetter tropical wet-dry climate near the end of Morrison deposition (Brushy Basin deposition). The northern part of the basin experienced similar trends across a mosaic of Mediterranean climate types. The range and mosaic pattern of wet-dry Morrison climates is analogous to the range of climates (and their seasonal variability) that dominates the African savanna today. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

When bees were allowed to actively touch a sucrose droplet with one antenna, contacts with the solution were frequent with durations of 10-20 ms and average intervals between contacts of approximately 40 ms. High sucrose concentrations led to short and frequent contacts. The proboscis response and M17 activity were largely independent of stimulus duration and temporal pattern. Taste hairs of the antennal tip displayed spike responses to sucrose concentrations down to at least 0.1%. The first 25 ms of the response were suitable for discrimination of sucrose concentrations. This time interval corresponds to the duration of naturally occurring gustatory stimuli. Sucrose responses between different hairs on the same antenna showed a high degree of variability, ranging from less than five to over 40 spikes per 0.5 s for a stimulus of 0.1% sucrose.

We describe a novel pollinator model predicting flower visitation rates by wild central-place foragers (e.g., nesting bees) in spatially explicit landscapes. The model goes beyond existing approaches by: (1) integrating preferential use of more rewarding floral and nesting resources; (2) considering population growth over time; (3) allowing different dispersal distances for workers and reproductives; (4) providing visitation rates for use in crop pollination models. We use the model to estimate the effect of establishing grassy field margins offering nesting resources and a low quantity of flower resources, and/or late-flowering flower strips offering no nesting resources but abundant flowers, on bumble bee populations and visitation rates to flowers in landscapes that differ in amounts of linear seminatural habitats and early mass-flowering crops. Flower strips were three times more effective in increasing pollinator populations and visitation rates than field margins, and this effect increased over time. Late-blooming flower strips increased early-season visitation rates, but decreased visitation rates in other late-season flowers. Increases in population size over time in response to flower strips and amounts of linear seminatural habitats reduced this apparent competition for pollinators. Our spatially explicit, process-based model generates emergent patterns reflecting empirical observations, such that adding flower resources may have contrasting short- and long-term effects due to apparent competition for pollinators and pollinator population size increase. It allows exploring these effects and comparing effect sizes in ways not possible with other existing models. Future applications include species comparisons, analysis of the sensitivity of predictions to life-history traits, as well as large-scale management intervention and policy assessment. © 2017 The Authors.

We compared melissopalynology, where pollen grains retrieved from honey are identified morphologically, with a DNA metabarcoding approach using the rbcL DNA barcode marker and 454-pyrosequencing. We compared nine honeys supplied by beekeepers in the UK. DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology were able to detect the most abundant floral components of honey. There was 92% correspondence for the plant taxa that had an abundance of over 20%. However, the level of similarity when all taxa were compared was lower, ranging from 22-45%, and there was little correspondence between the relative abundance of taxa found using the two techniques. DNA metabarcoding provided much greater repeatability, with a 64% taxa match compared to 28% with melissopalynology. DNA metabarcoding has the advantage over melissopalynology in that it does not require a high level of taxonomic expertise, a greater sample size can be screened and it provides greater resolution for some plant families. However, it does not provide a quantitative approach and pollen present in low levels are less likely to be detected. We investigated the plants that were frequently used by honey bees by examining the results obtained from both techniques. Plants with a broad taxonomic range were detected, covering 46 families and 25 orders, but a relatively small number of plants were consistently seen across multiple honey samples. Frequently found herbaceous species were Rubus fruticosus, Filipendula ulmaria, Taraxacum officinale, Trifolium spp., Brassica spp. and the non-native, invasive, Impatiens glandulifera. Tree pollen was frequently seen belonging to Castanea sativa, Crataegus monogyna and species of Malus, Salix and Quercus.We conclude that although honey bees are considered to be supergeneralists in their foraging choices, there are certain key species or plant groups that are particularly important in the honey bees environment. The reasons for this require further investigation in order to better understand honey bee nutritional requirements.

It is important to understand the pollination processes that generate landscape-scale gene dispersal in plants, particularly in crop plants with genetically modified (GM) varieties. In one such crop, Brassica napus, the situation is complicated by uncertainty over the relative importance of two pollen vectors, wind and insects. 2. We investigated pollination in two fields of B. napus that bloomed at different times of year (April vs. July) and attracted different abundances of foraging social bees. Rates of pollen transfer were quantified by counting the pollen grains deposited on stigmas and remaining in the anthers at intervals after flower opening. 3. Flowers open in April were adequately pollinated only after 5 days and only 10% received even a single bee visit. Flowers open in July received three bee visits per hour and were fully pollinated within 3 h. 4. Based on published measurements of airborne pollen dispersal, we estimate that wind-pollination from a hypothetical field 1 km distant could have fertilized up to 0.3% of the field's seed when bees were scarce in April but only up to 0.007% when bees were abundant in July. 5. The efficiency of pollination (the proportion of pollen released from anthers that landed on receptive stigmas) was seven times greater in July (1.5%) than in April (0.2%). The relatively high efficiency of insect pollination may help to explain the evolutionary maintenance of entomophily. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results begin to resolve a long-standing inconsistency among previous studies by suggesting that the susceptibility of fields of B. napus to long-distance cross-pollination by wind depends on the level of bee activity. Models for predicting GM gene flow at the landscape-scale in this crop should take this into account. © 2006 The Authors.","the influence of pollinator abundance on the dynamics and efficiency","1.

The host range of this Drosophila endoparasitoid notably includes the highly-studied model organism, Drosophila melanogaster.

In this paper we identify the requirements of a large-scale monitoring study for the assessment of side-effects of clothianidin seed-treated winter oilseed rape on three species of pollinating insects (Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis) and present how these requirements were implemented. Two circular study sites were delineated next to each other in northeast Germany and comprised almost 65 km(2) each. At the reference site, study fields were drilled with clothianidin-free OSR seeds while at the test site the oilseed rape seeds contained a coating with 10 g clothianidin and 2 g beta-cyfluthrin per kg seeds (EladoA (R)). The comparison of environmental conditions at the study sites indicated that they are as similar as possible in terms of climate, soil, land use, history and current practice of agriculture as well as in availability of oilseed rape and non-crop bee forage. Accordingly, local environmental conditions were considered not to have had any confounding effect on the results of the monitoring of the bee species.

We studied aerial insect communities by tracking the foraging altitudes of an avian insectivore, the Purple Martin (Progne subis). By attaching altitude loggers to nesting Purple Martins and collecting prey delivered to their nestlings, we determined the flight altitudes of ants and other insects. We then tested hypotheses relating ant body size and reproductive ecology to flight altitude. Purple Martins flew up to 1,889 meters above ground, and nestling provisioning trips ranged up to 922 meters. Insect communities were structured by body size such that species of all sizes flew near the ground but only light insects flew to the highest altitudes. Ant maximum flight altitudes decreased by 60% from the lightest to the heaviest species. Winged sexuals of social insects (ants, honey bees, and termites) dominated the Purple Martin diet, making up 88% of prey individuals and 45% of prey biomass. By transferring energy from terrestrial to aerial food webs, mating swarms of social insects play a substantial role in aerial ecosystems. Although we focus on Purple Martins and ants, our combined logger and diet method could be applied to a range of aerial organisms.","predator foraging altitudes reveal the structure of aerial insect communities","The atmosphere is populated by a diverse array of dispersing"

Resource pulses, narrow periods of high resource availability, can elicit strong behavioural responses across diverse taxa. Mass-flowering agricultural crops are an example of a resource pulse that insect pollinators exploit. However, the underlying mechanism behind changes in pollinator behaviour associated with mass-flowering crops is still relatively unexplored. 2. The present study quantified the behavioural response of bumble bees, an important wild pollinator, to commercial cranberry bloom, an important mass-flowering crop in Wisconsin, U.S.A. Over a 2-year period, foraging trip duration was measured using radio frequency identification at 14 farms situated across landscape contexts, ranging from high to low natural area (woodland amount). Using transect surveys, floral resource abundance at a landscape scale was estimated. 3. It was found that bumble bees were highly sensitive to temporal changes in landscape-level resource abundance associated with the onset of cranberry bloom, during which they decreased foraging trip duration by 22% and increased the number of foraging trips during bloom by 24% on average relative to the period before and after bloom. This phenomenon was consistent across colonies, individual bees, and landscape contexts, despite a higher abundance of flowers in low woodland landscapes. Bumble bee colonies growing in low- and high-woodland landscapes exhibited a similar performance. 4. As mass-flowering crops are probably a factor influencing bumble bee foraging behaviour in agricultural regions, investigations should continue into how variable resource landscapes, particularly those offering resource pulses, affect wild pollinators and the pollination services they provide.","floral resource pulse decreases bumble bee foraging trip duration in","1.

Agricultural intensification and loss of wild floral resources rank among the main factors contributing to this decline. Landscape enhancement of floral resources has been proposed as an agro-environmental scheme intended to provide honeybees with compensatory food sources in intensive agrosystems. Floral scheme efficiency has rarely been evaluated with respect to landscape context. In this study, we developed and validated a modeling tool to delineate the landscape areas likely to be associated with higher efficiency of floral enhancement schemes. In particular, the proximity of some landscape elements used by honeybees, either as foraging habitat or as visual landmark for orientation, may partly determine floral scheme efficiency. We investigated this issue using resource selection functions (RSFs), i.e. models that aim to predict the occurrence of foraging honeybees at floral patches as a function of the presence of keystone landscape elements in their proximity. However, deciding which landscape elements are effectively in the proximity or not is mostly a matter of subjectivity. The novelty of our approach resides in its use of a distance-weighting function to explicitly account for the spatial location of surrounding landscape elements. In that respect, a distance function should be scaled on movement patterns of foraging organisms. Herein, we inferred movement patterns from the autocorrelative properties of honeybee foraging activity. This modeling approach was developed on Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia) field margin strips, a typical "" honeybee-friendly"" floral scheme. A foraging survey conducted on 170 Phacelia plots (2 m × 2. m) from 17 Phacelia strips, all positioned within the foraging range of an experimental apiary, revealed that (i) the floral scheme efficiency is positively influenced by the presence of linear landscape elements such as hedgerows and forest edges, but negatively affected by the presence of alternative floral resources, and that (ii) weighting the relative importance of those landscape elements by incorporating a distance function into models considerably improved their predictive power. This modeling tool has the potential to help land managers optimizing their financial investment by avoiding low-efficiency landscape areas, or favoring high-efficiency ones, at the time of planning floral enhancement schemes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","spatial autocorrelation in honeybee foraging activity reveals optimal focus scale","A substantial honeybee decline is being observed worldwide.

In this study, we surveyed wild bees and quantified their nectar and pollen foraging success in a rosemary Mediterranean scrubland in southern France, under different conditions of apiary size and proximity. We found that high-density beekeeping triggers foraging competition which depresses not only the occurrence (-55%) and nectar foraging success (-50%) of local wild bees but also nectar (-44%) and pollen (-36%) harvesting by the honeybees themselves. Overall, those competition effects spanned distances of 600-1.100 m around apiaries, i.e. covering 1.1-3.8km2 areas. Regardless the considered competition criterion, setting distance thresholds among apiaries appeared more tractable than setting colony density thresholds for beekeeping regulation. Moreover, the intraspecific competition among the honeybees has practical implications for beekeepers. It shows that the local carrying capacity has been exceeded and raises concerns for honey yields and colony sustainability. It also offers an effective ecological criterion for pragmatic decision-making whenever conservation practitioners envision progressively reducing beekeeping in protected areas.

Furthermore, such species are typically among the last in a community to reestablish due to their reliance upon lower trophic level resources and a requirement for persistent, stable ecological conditions. Consequently their presence alone can be indicative of healthy ecosystems. Using replicated, quantitative food webs we studied the impacts of a restoration treatment upon the interactions of a tri-trophic community consisting of plants, their bumble bee pollinators, and the parasites, parasitoids, and pathogens of the bumble bees at heathland sites. We found the lower trophic levels of the community successfully reinstated at restored relative to control sites. However the abundance, load per host, prevalence of parasitism, prevalence of superparasitism, and host range of a key dipteran parasitoid of the family Conopidae were all significantly reduced in restored heathlands. Potential causes for this incomplete reestablishment at restored sites include the lag in floral resources due to differences in. oral species composition, and the reduced ability of this parasitoid species in accessing host resources relative to other natural enemy species present in these communities. Moreover the incomplete reinstatement of the natural enemy community was found to significantly reduce levels of network vulnerability (a measure of how vulnerable prey is to being consumed) at restored sites relative to ancient, control networks.","the restoration of parasites, parasitoids, and pathogens to heathland communities","Higher trophic level species such as parasites, parasitoids, and pathogens"

Germinating pollen grains were observed in the anthers of all species, forming large interwoven clumps that were transferred by the pollinators as a unit. In V. caerulea and V. rosea, stamens and stigmas were positioned close together, enabling the plants to self-pollinate. In contrast, male and female organs are widely separated in V. clavaia. Pollen to ovule ratios of all species were low (33-78), indicating that pollen transfer (either by selling or by outcrossing) is very efficient. Flower visitors were butterflies (V. caerulea, V. rosea) and/or long-tongued bees of the genus Euglossa (V. clavata, V. rosea). Nevertheless, Voyria caerulea and V. rosea were visited only rarely and irregularly. We suggest that these two species follow a mixed selfing-outcrossing strategy to ensure seed production when pollen transfer by visitors fails. In contrast, V. clavata showed a high degree of specialization towards euglossine-pollinators, which were frequent visitors. The close plant-pollinator interaction increases the probability of outcrossings and might have enabled this species to completely rely on pollinators for reproduction. Average seed set in the studied species ranged between 36% and 49% and was very variable among individuals, probably due to resource-limitation.

Apis mellifera is the main pollinator in agricultural environments and is a well-known model for behavioural research. Honeybees are also accurate biosensors of environmental pollutants and their appetitive behavioural response is a suitable tool with which to test sub-lethal effects of agrochemicals. We studied the effects of field-realistic doses of GLY on honeybees exposed chronically or acutely to the herbicide. We focused on sucrose sensitivity, elemental and non-elemental associative olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER), and foraging-related behaviour. We found a reduced sensitivity to sucrose and learning performance for the groups chronically exposed to GLY concentrations within the range of recommended doses. When olfactory PER conditioning was performed with sucrose reward with the same GLY concentrations (acute exposure), elemental learning and short-term memory retention decreased significantly compared with controls. Non-elemental associative learning was also impaired by an acute exposure to GLY traces. Altogether, these results imply that GLY at concentrations found in agro-ecosystems as a result of standard spraying can reduce sensitivity to nectar reward and impair associative learning in honeybees. However, no effect on foragingrelated behaviour was found. Therefore, we speculate that successful forager bees could become a source of constant inflow of nectar with GLY traces that could then be distributed among nestmates, stored in the hive and have long-term negative consequences on colony performance. © 2014.

Our findings revealed three groups of species, distinguished on the basis of the realized response of individual species to regional climate warming: one comprising six species with climate-based tracking behaviour, a second with three species tracking suitable landscape composition and configuration regardless of climatic conditions, and a third comprising one species showing no apparent tracking behaviour. Main conclusions: Topoclimate and land cover determined the occurrence and abundance patterns of bumblebee species in mountainous landscapes, even at fine spatial extents. Both environmental variables, however, differentially influenced bumblebees, thereby providing relevant clues for determining the current environmental factors underlying species' distributions and their susceptibility to changing environmental conditions. Our findings therefore suggest that determining habitat suitability can be used as a baseline approach for understanding species-specific responses to climate warming and for developing vulnerability assessments for conservation-focused management planning. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","determining habitat suitability for bumblebees in a mountain system: a","Aim: Our aim was to determine the role of environmental"

I investigated how thermal environment affects the interaction between the early-blooming daffodil, Narcissus longispathus (Amaryllidaceae) and its major bee pollinator (Andrena bicolor; Andrenidae), focusing simultaneously on plant and pollinator sides of the interaction. I studied fruit and seed set, flower duration, and the intrafloral thermal environment of N. longispathus, and the thermal biology, foraging behavior, and thermoregulatory ability of A. bicolor over a 6-yr period in southeastern Spain. N. longispathus flowers from February to April, when unsuitable weather often limits pollinator activity, yet most flowers are successfully pollinated in all years and sites. Fruit set was weakly pollen limited, but among flowers setting fruit the proportion of ovules developing into seeds was not. Individual flowers lasted for 17 d on average, remaining functional during this period. On sunny days, the air inside N. longispathus flowers was significantly warmer than outside. Mean temperature excess inside flowers was as high as 8 degrees C, and was positively related to solar irradiance. Within flowers, air temperature was highest around the anthers; this intrafloral gradient was consistent with variation among perianth parts in radiation transmittance. Andrena bicolor foraged in N. longispathus flowering patches only on sunny days with air temperature >12 degrees-13 degrees C, and foraging behavior and flower visitation rate were temperature dependent. Bees were able to fly at relatively low thoracic temperatures (T-th; range 22 degrees-31 degrees C) and this was essential for successfully foraging at N. longispathus. Under the range of irradiance and air temperature found at foraging sites, A. bicolor individuals inside flowers were able to reach T-th suitable for flight by passive means alone. Under laboratory conditions, A. bicolor was unable to raise or otherwise regulate T-th by physiological means, but free-flying individuals thermoregulated behaviorally. Basking was used to raise T-th and intrafloral microclimate, by influencing the proportion of foraging time devoted to basking, played an important role in thermoregulation. Flower visitation rate was positively related to the average temperature inside visited flowers, and the probability of basking immediately after one floral visit declined with increasing flower temperature. I conclude that the favorable microclimate within N. longispathus flowers, their long duration, and the thermal biology of A. bicolor, were critical elements in this early-season pollination system.","floral biology, microclimate, and pollination by ectothermic bees in an","Abiotic factors may constrain the functioning of species interactions such"

Experiments conducted in two different years consistently showed that natural and artificial nectars containing yeasts were more thoroughly removed than nectars without yeasts. Experimental yeast inoculation of the nectar of H. foetidus flowers was significantly associated with reductions in number of pollen tubes in the style, fruit set, seed set, and mass of individual seeds produced.

Insecticidal Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton is planted on millions of hectares annually and is a potential source of transgene flow. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we monitored 15 non-Bt cotton (Gossypium hirsutum, L.) seed production fields (some transgenic for herbicide resistance, some not) for gene flow of the Bt cotton cry1Ac transgene. We investigated seed-mediated gene flow, which yields adventitious Bt cotton plants, and pollen-mediated gene flow, which generates outcrossed seeds. A spatially-explicit statistical analysis was used to quantify the effects of nearby Bt and non-Bt cotton fields at various spatial scales, along with the effects of pollinator abundance and adventitious Bt plants in fields, on pollen-mediated gene flow. Adventitious Bt cotton plants, resulting from seed bags and planting error, comprised over 15% of plants sampled from the edges of three seed production fields. In contrast, pollen-mediated gene flow affected less than 1% of the seed sampled from field edges. Variation in outcrossing was better explained by the area of Bt cotton fields within 750 m of the seed production fields than by the area of Bt cotton within larger or smaller spatial scales. Variation in outcrossing was also positively associated with the abundance of honey bees. Conclusions/Significance: A comparison of statistical methods showed that our spatially-explicit analysis was more powerful for understanding the effects of surrounding fields than customary models based on distance. Given the low rates of pollen-mediated gene flow observed in this study, we conclude that careful planting and screening of seeds could be more important than field spacing for limiting gene flow.","pollen- and seed-mediated transgene flow in commercial cotton seed production","Background: Characterizing the spatial patterns of gene flow from transgenic"

In this study, we analyse the bee community of one of the main, Spanish DRs, and evaluate its effects on flower visitation and seed set in adjacent sunflower fields. We used pan traps to assess bee abundance and richness at 13 sites along the DR and in adjacent sunflower fields at 10, 75 and 150m from the DR. We also conducted visual counts to assess visitation rates to sunflower heads and measured seed set. Wild bee abundance and richness were significantly higher in the DR than in sunflower fields; but there were no significant differences among distances within sunflower fields. Honey bee abundance did not differ between the DR and sunflower fields. Wild bee visitation to sunflower heads was higher at 10 m compared to 75 and 150 m from the DR, but differences in honey bee visitation were non-significant. Sunflower seed set was significantly higher at 10 m compared to 75 and 150 m, and was associated with wild bee abundance, but not with honey bee abundance.

This model analyses the efficiency of sugar intake, or energy flux, which for nectarivores closely approximates the rate of net energy gain. For both steady state and some non-steady flows of nectars, this energy flux is shown to be maximal at particular sugar concentrations referred to here as the maximum flux concentration. Higher concentrations actually yield lower energy intake rates because the concomitant rapid increase in viscosity sharply reduces the rate of fluid intake. For pure sucrose solutions, the maximum flux concentration is 22%. For flower nectars, which are chemically more complex, the maximum flux concentration is predicted to be closer to 26%, using the first viscosity measures obtained for flower nectars. This concentration is shown to be essentially independent of the pollinator's feeding organ morphology and of the type of potential inducing nectar flow. It is proposed that this concentration applies for virtually all pollinators that select nectars with maximal energy flux. However not all pollinators are expected to select such nectars because this 26% concentration is not necessarily ""optimal"". The model predicts that optimal sugar concentrations vary for particular pollinators as a function of two primary factors: (1) the energy flux derived from the nectar, as discussed above, as well as (2) the relative contribution of transit costs to overall foraging costs. Relatively ""dilute"" nectars, with sugar concentrations close to the maximal flux value, are predicted for flowers pollinated by organisms that minimize feeding time to reduce high feeding costs, such as that of hovering or of exposure to enhanced predation while feeding. More concentrated nectars are predicted for flowers pollinated by nectarivores that incur high foraging transit costs relative to feeding costs. Flowers pollinated by hovering pollinators, including many hummingbirds, hawkmoths and bats, have nectars with mean sugar concentrations in close accord with the 26% maximum flux concentration predicted. Moreover, these nectars have relatively low concentrations of nonsugar constituents, which increase viscosity and thereby decrease sugar flux. Over 75% of the flowers examined in this study, which are pollinated primarily by territorial hummingbird species, provide nectars that allow sugar uptake with an efficiency of 90% or greater of the maximal value. According to the model, these data suggest that feeding costs of these pollinators far outweigh foraging transit costs. In contrast, the model suggests that flower nectars taken by traplining hummingbirds and by bees, with sugar concentrations significantly above the maximum flux value, reflect the higher costs of foraging flight relative to costs of feeding for these pollinators. Increasing temperature decreases nectar viscosity, and thereby increases absolute nectar uptake rates sharply. This leads to a number of predictions regarding foraging behavior as well as flower location, orientation, and color. However, the maximum flux concentration is shown to be practically invariable over a wide range of temperatures-increasing by only 2% sugar from 10°C to 30°C. Thus, contrary to previous expectations, little change in average sugar concentrations of flowers pollinated by particular groups of nectarivores is expected from cooler to warmer regions. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.","optimal sugar concentrations of floral nectars -dependence on sugar intake","A model is developed to elucidate the determinants of sugar"

Mortality rate increased with both age and wing damage. Damaged bees carried out shorter and/or less frequent foraging trips, foraged closer to the hive, and reported the profitability of flower patches to be lower than did controls.

Such predators can be costly to their host plant by consuming pollinators. However, sit-and-wait predators are often prey generalists that also consume plant antagonists such as herbivores, nectar robbers and granivores, so may also provide benefits to their host plant. Here we present a simple, but general, model that provides novel predictions about how costs and benefits interact in different ecological circumstances. The model predicts that the ecological conditions in which flower-dwelling predators are found can generate either net benefits to their host plants, net costs to their host plants, or can have no effect on the fitness of their host plants. The net effect is influenced by the relative densities of mutualists and antagonists. The flower-dwelling predator has a strong positive effect on the plant if both the pollinators and the granivores are at high density. Further, the range of density combinations that yield a positive net outcome for the plant increases if the performance of pollinators is negatively density dependent, if the predator is only moderately effective at influencing flower visitor rates by its potential prey, and if pollinators are very effective. If plants of a given species find themselves consistently in conditions where they benefit from the presence of a predator then we predict that natural selection could favour the evolution of plant traits that increase the likelihood of predator recruitment and retention, especially where plants are served by highly effective pollinators.","the impact of flower-dwelling predators on host plant reproductive success","Flowers attract insects and so are commonly exploited as foraging"

Foragers' flight activity was relatively constant in a wide range of temperature, from 22 degrees C to 34 degrees C. The minimum temperature for the beginning of flight activity was 14 degrees C. Effective flight activity (when foragers of all colonies were leaving the hives) occurred at 15 degrees C. These bees also flew within a wide range of relative humidity, from 30% to 100%, decreasing slowly after 50%. Flight activity increased as light intensity rose and it has also increased as the hours passed by, reaching a peak around midday and decreasing gradually afterwards.

Although travelling farther to harvest a greater net energetic reward is beneficial, many animals opt for a smaller net reward that requires less travel. Recent discoveries of a visual basis for flower constancy in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, led us to examine older reports that colour cues are superceded by energetic considerations. Here we show that when individual bees foraged on pedicellate artificial flowers varying in colour and interfloral distance, their behaviour depended on the colours in the choice test. Colours of similar spectral reflectance (blue versus white), that would be clustered in the bee's visual colour space, elicited more visits to the closest flower when rewards were equal, but individuals travelled a greater distance to harvest a higher energetic reward when reward quality varied. Bees chose the closest flower more often when reward volume decreased while quality remained constant. Yet, even when all flowers were identical (morphology and reward), and only interfloral distance varied, bees did not always visit the closest flower. A dramatic difference was seen when the dimorphism was yellow-blue, colours quite separate in the bee colour space and known to elicit constancy behaviour. Here, bees visited the closest flower only 5% of the time, and varying reward volume did not elicit different behaviour. Animals thus display differential foraging behaviour with respect to environmental cues that must be considered when asking questions about other behavioural parameters. © 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","foraging decisions in nectarivores: unexpected interactions between flower constancy and","Foraging decisions are based on a suite of choices that"

The high genetic differentiation among populations of Encholirium horridum L.B.Sm. indicates low gene flow for this species that occurs exclusively on granitic inselbergs in South-east Brazil. Here we describe reproductive and pollination attributes of this bromeliad assessing how they influence the current degree of genetic isolation among populations. The mating system, estimated using five microsatellites markers, indicated allogamy and low pollen pool structure. The breeding system assessed by hand-pollination treatments supported partial self-incompatibility combined with inbreeding depression. Flowers of E. horridum are bell-shaped with crepuscular/nocturnal anthesis, and high nectar production, suggesting chiropterophily. Its pollination system was actually generalist but bats and hummingbirds were more frequent than hawkmoths and crepuscular bees. The high local abundance and large floral display per individual plant contributed to short distance pattern of pollen movement by pollinators. At the intra-population level, this pollinator foraging pattern, with inbreeding depression, promotes low seed viability and individual variations on outcrossing rate. At the inter-population level, those features led to low gene flow. Overall, heterozygosity, maintained by self-incompatibility and inbreeding depression, and pollination by vertebrates described here for E. horridum are consistent with other attributes that are predicted for inselberg plants by the OCBIL theory, such as reduced dispersability and genetic isolation among populations. Those characteristics contribute to the isolation of E. horridum populations and heighten the importance of population-based conservation strategies for taxa that occur exclusively in those naturally fragmented inselbergs. © CSIRO 2017.","high outcrossing rates and short-distance pollination in a species restricted","Plant populations that are spatially isolated may experience genetic isolation"

Here, we investigate patterns of outcrossed mating through male function in Narcissus triandrus, a tristylous, bee-pollinated wild daffodil from the Iberian Peninsula, to test pollen transfer models which predict that floral morphology promotes asymmetrical mating and biased morph ratios. Unlike other tristylous species, N. triandrus has an incompatibility system that permits intra-morph mating and long-level rather than mid-level stamens in the L-morph. Incomplete sex-organ reciprocity should result in significant intra-morph mating in the L-morph. We measured mating patterns in two L-biased populations - dimorphic (two style morphs) and trimorphic (three style morphs) - using multilocus genotyping and maximum-likelihood-based paternity analysis. We also examined the spatial distribution of style morphs and neutral markers to investigate the potential consequence of spatially restricted mating on morph ratios. As predicted, we detected significant amounts of intra-morph mating in the L-morph in both populations. Pollen transfer coefficients generally supported predictions based on the Darwinian hypothesis that anthers and stigmas of equivalent level promote pollinator-mediated cross-pollination in heterostylous populations. There was evidence of significant spatial aggregation of both style morphs and neutral markers in populations of N. triandrus, probably as a result of restricted pollen and seed dispersal.

Nonetheless, commercial growers rent honey bee hives for pollination, resulting in the dominance of honey bee workers visiting flowers during bloom.The objective of this study was to examine where on the honey bee pollen is carried and how it is transferred from flower to bee to the stigma of other flowers. Examination of 90 honey bee workers foraging on blueberry flowers documented that blueberry pollen tetrads were present on all body parts. Relative amounts were as follows: head 12%, body 6%, legs 19%, and tarsi 63%. Quantities on the body subregions ranged from an average of 400 tetrads on the basitarsi to 16 on the fore tarsal claws. Thus, a single contact between many of the pollen-carrying body parts and a stigma has the potential to transfer significant amounts of pollen. The study also revealed that bee behaviors unrelated to the intentional collection of nectar and pollen, such as the frequent touching of stigmas by the claws, tarsi, or legs, while foraging, grooming, and walking across flower clusters, could result in pollen transfer.These contacts occurred 65.9% of the time a honey bee landed on a flower cluster.

This is also true for the introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMO) into agriculture. In Germany, precautionary regulations currently demand isolation distances (i. e. buffer zones) for the cultivation of genetically modified maize (Bt-maize) in the vicinity of conventional (150 m) and organic maize fields (300 m). The Bt-toxin may harm non-target organisms (NTO) such as Lepidoptera. Despite this, corresponding regulations for the protection of nature reserves are lacking to date. Conventional and Bt-maize have been grown in the vicinity of the Flora-Fauna-Habitat (FFH) Ruhlsdorfer Bruch in Brandenburg, Germany. The aim of this study was to investigate whether exposure of maize pollen from surrounding Bt-maize fields to NTOs in the nature protection area could be excluded or not. Two types of exposure were investigated: Firstly, whether maize pollen was dispersed by wind into the nature reserve area exposing resident NTOs. Secondly, foraging NTOs from the nature reserve are exposed by roaming the surrounding fields and collecting maize pollen. In order to fulfil the precautionary principle defined by law, the study should help to determine appropriate isolation distances for the cultivation f Bt-maize with regard to sustainable protection of NTOs in the FFH Ruhlsdorfer Bruch. In 2007, the local authorities issued an isolation distance between Bt-maize fields and nature reserves of 100 m and in 2008, this became 250 m in the northern and 500 m in the westerly direction, respectively. Materials and methods Standardised methods for biological and technical pollen sampling issued by the Association of German Engineers (VDI 4330 Part 3, 2007 and VDI 4330 Part 4, 2006) were applied providing a quality controlled and methodologically harmonised database which does not only serve the needs to be fulfilled by the present case-specific monitoring study but can also be used as a reference database for further investigations. Maize pollen exposure was measured within the FFH Ruhlsdorfer Bruch and its immediate vicinity in July and August 2007 and 2008. In 2007, the sampling was performed at three sites using 12 technical samplers (Sigma-2/PMF) placed at five measuring points at distances from 5 m to 120 m from the maize field edges. Additionally, for biological pollen sampling six bee colonies were situated at these three sites (two colonies at each site). The technical sampler Sigma-2/PMF enables point sampling which is primarily influenced by wind and topography providing information on effective maize pollen input (flow and deposition) at the measuring sites. Honey-bees roaming in the surrounding area with typical foraging distances of several kilometres may act as planar collectors. They may serve as indicators for the exposure to pollen-collecting NTOs. Furthermore, biological sampling is more selective due to the organism's preferences, whereas the technical sampling is neutral. Hence, both the technical and the biological sampling complement each other in their scope of application. The pollen samples of both matrices were analysed microscopically and the maize pollen loads were quantified. Pollen-DNA was analysed by means of the quantitative PCR-method (qPCR) identifying conventional and Bt-maize pollen by two independent laboratories. In 2008, the monitoring was repeated with additional sites. Eighteen technical samplers were exposed at five sites with eight measuring points at distances from 5 m to 250 m from the maize field edges. Two honey-bee colonies for biological sampling were placed at one site for control purposes. PCR-analyses were performed to measure the amounts of Bt-maize pollen in the samples. Results The results of pollen monitoring at the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch revealed maize pollen exposure for all monitoring sites in both surveys. In 2007, up to 1.75 million maize pollen/m2 were deposited at sites closest to the maize field. At 120 m from field edge in the middle of the FFH-reserve, 99,000 maize pollen/m2 were detected. In 2008, similar results were found, at distances up to 250 m from the field edges deposition of 164,000 maize pollen/m2 was detected. Data on maize pollen deposition show a clear distance relationship and are in accordance with results of further comprehensive surveys based on the same methodology (Hofmann 2007). The results of the microscopic analysis of the pollen pellets demonstrated that bees collected maize pollen at all sites, in 2007 and 2008. Although maize pollen is not the main food source (2007: 0.1-0.3 %; 2008:2-3 %) the collection efficiency of the bee colonies resulted in high amounts of sampled maize pollen with 4 to 11 million per site in 2007 and up to 467 million in 2008. Molecular-biological analysis of maize pollen DNA by qPCR demonstrated that transgenic Bt-MON810 DNA was present in all technical and biological samples, corroborated by two independent laboratories. In 2007, the GMO-content in the samples ranged up to 44 % in the bioaerosols and 49 % in the pollen pellets. In 2008, GMO-proportions of up to 18 % were detected. Discussion The results of this study provide evidence that NTOs in the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch were exposed to Bt-maize pollen under the cultivation conditions in 2007 with a buffer zone of 100 m. The GMO-content reached up to 48 %. The results of the monitoring in 2008 confirmed these findings. Even though the exposure could be reduced by increasing the isolation distances to 250 m and 500 m respectively, the results still show percentages of up to 18 % Bt-MON810 in the pollen samples. The results on maize pollen deposition at the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch in 2007 and 2008 correspond to the results of an investigation which was conducted over several years applying the same standardised method, but covering a wider range of distances. The correlation between maize pollen deposition (n/m2) and distance to the source field (m) fitted best to a power function of the type y = 1.2086 ""106"" x-0.548. Despite the same trend, the pollen deposition in the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch revealed above-average findings. Also the analysis of the pollen pellets collected by the bees showed an exposure in 2007 with values for the GMO-content of up to 49 %. For both methods, the exposure decreased in 2008 due to the greater buffer zones up to 500 m. Whereas the GMO-content for the biological sampling were reduced to values below 10 %, the values for the technical sampling were still higher indicating that greater buffer zones would be necessary for safety reasons under the precautionary principle. Conclusions The results of this investigation proved that maize pollen were dispersed by wind to distances farther than 250 m from field edge leading to maize pollen exposure in the centre of the nature reserve. The results also demonstrated that foraging NTOs living in the nature reserve were exposed to maize pollen from surrounding fields. Considering the cultivation of Bt-maize MON810, the assumption of the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) that there will be no relevant exposure beyond the Bt-maize fields, cannot be confirmed. Considering the results of this and related studies and with respect to the precautionary principle, one can state that buffer zones between Bt-maize fields and protected areas are an effective measure to minimise the exposure of Bt-maize pollen to NTOs and, thus, to prevent from adverse effects. Recommendations and perspectives Because of still insufficient ecotoxicological data for the risk assessment of Bt-maize MON810 considering butterflies and other protected NTOs, protection standards assuring the precautionary principle have to be implemented to avoid Bt-maize pollen exposure to NTOs. This applies for the case Ruhlsdorfer Bruch and for nature reserve areas in general. In order to exclude risks to protected NTOs occurring in nature reserves, sufficient buffer zones for Bt-maize cultivation should be considered. The statistical analysis revealed that distances of more than 500 m are necessary to decisively reduce exposure to foraging insects. In fact, distances of more than 1,000 m are necessary to prevent maize pollen deposition from values above 100,000 pollen/m2 with a certainty of 90 %. An adequate risk assessment can only be attained if based on field measurements accounting for the high variation of pollen deposition due to local environmental site conditions and field management. The monitoring should be based on standardised methods. It should include locations with the highest expected deposition rates, the boundaries of the protected areas and sites of interest within those boundaries, e. g., specific habitats of sensitive species. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","monitoring of bt-maize pollen exposure in the vicinity of the","Background, aim, and scope Basically, technological innovations are associated with"

Nature reserves are not included. The aim of this study was to investigate whether maize pollen of surrounding fields were dispersed in the Flora-Fauna-Habitat (FFH) Ruhlsdorfer Bruch. In the vicinity of the nature reserve Bt-maize species MON 810 as well as conventional maize was grown. The survey should provide appropriate isolation distances for the cultivation of Bt-maize with regard to sustainable protection of non-target-organisms (NTO) in the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch. Materials and Methods: The collection of maize pollen in the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch was carried out at three sampling sites in the FFH or rather in the immediate vicinity in July and August 2007 by means of twelve technical and three biological pollen samplers. The technical samplers Sigma-2/PMF enable point sampling. They are primarily influenced by wind and topography and provide information about the effective entry, the maize pollen flow and the maize pollen deposition at the location of the sampler. Honey bees roam over longer distances and are hence planar collectors. Thus, they also provide information about the plants blooming in a distinct area. Furthermore, the biological preferences during the collection are captured, whereas a technical sampler does not perform a species dependent selection. Hence, both the technical and the biological samplers complement one another in their scope of application. The pollen samples were identified microscopically, enumerated quantitatively, and the pollen-DNA was analysed by means of the PCR-method. Results: All monitoring sites at the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch revealed maize pollen entries. The pollen deposition reached values of 1.75 million maize pollen/m2 in the close-up range. The monitoring sites located 120 m within the protected area still featured 99,000 maize pollen/m2. As shown by the statistical analysis, at a distance of 1,000 m still 28,000 maize pollen/m2 must be expected. The results of the microscopic pollen analysis of the pollen pellets proved that the bees collect maize pollen at all three sites. Although maize pollen is not the main food source the high collection efficiency of the bees resulted in large amounts of introduced pollen. The biomolecular proof of pollen-DNA in the field samples was corroborated by analogue results for both the technical and biological pollen sampling by two independent laboratories. The results of these quality controlled analyses gave unambiguous evidence that under the cultivation conditions in 2007 an entry of Bt-maize pollen into the FFH Ruhlsdorfer Bruch was existent. Discussion: The maize pollen deposition at the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch corresponds with additional supra-regional investigations which were conducted over several years with the same method. However, the pollen entries into the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch are above-average. Possible reasons are the size of the maize fields (&gt; 10 ha), the geographical collocation between maize fields and protected area (lee location, through-shaped, thermal currents) as well as weather conditions and maize bloom during the sampling period July and August 2007. A distance of 1,000 m or more is necessary to avoid maize pollen deposition of more than 100,000/m2 with a probability of 90%. Conclusions: The results of this investigation prove an entry of Bt-maize pollen into the FFH under the cultivation and weather conditions in summer 2007. According to the results of this and related studies and considering precautionary principle and the effect terms defined in the Federal Immission Protection Law, it becomes clear that reasonable isolation distances between Bt-maize fields and protected areas have to be introduced in order to minimise the entry of GM-maize pollen and to prevent adverse effects on protected NTOs. Recommendations: Due to the fact that no toxicological investigations are available for the butterflies occurring in the FFH, highest protection standards should be implemented to avoid Bt-maize pollen entries into the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch. That implies that highest possible isolation distances for Bt-maize cultivation have to be considered, but at least a distance of 1,000 m is recommended. Following this a maize pollen deposition of more than 100,000 maize pollen/m2 should be pevented with a certainty of 90% as well as an exceeding exposure of foraging insects. Outlook: By means of the pollen monitoring it becomes possible to survey empirically defined limits of pollen exposure. This should be performed in the nature reserve area at sites of expected maximum exposure, e.g. at the boundaries of the FFH towards the maize fields and at exposed sites. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","gmo-pollenmonitoring in respect to the cultivation of bt-maize in the","Aim and Background: Precautionary regulations for the production of genetically"

Among the species of special concern in Europe are bees, which, along with butterflies, are the best monitored insects. Bees are most species-rich in Mediterranean-type climates with short winters, warm springs, and dry summers. In Central Europe, climate warming per se is, therefore, expected to benefit most bee species, while pesticides and the loss of habitats and plant diversity should constitute threats. Here, we use the bee fauna of Germany, which has been monitored for Red Lists for over 40 years, to analyse the effects of habitat breadth, pollen specialization, body size, nesting sites, sociality, duration of flight activity, and time of emergence during the season. We tested each factor's predictive power against changes in commonness and Red List status, using phylogenetically informed hierarchical Bayesian (HB) models. Extinction vulnerability is strongly increased in bees flying in late summer, with a statistical model that included flight time, habitat preference, and duration of activity correctly predicting the vulnerability status of 85% of the species. Conversely, spring emergence and occurrence in urban areas each reduce vulnerability, pointing to intensive land use especially harming summer-active bees, with the combination of these factors currently shifting Germany's bee diversity towards warm-adapted, spring-flying, city-dwelling species.","narrow habitat breadth and late-summer emergence increases extinction vulnerability in","Evaluating intrinsic and extrinsic traits that predispose species to local"

In Finland, these statistics are available at aggregate national level, and at the level of each of the 15 provinces of the country. Yields of wind-pollinated crops have steadily increased in Finland, while yields of insect-pollinated crops have been highly variable. The largest crop benefitting from insect pollination is turnip rapeseed, which shows first a clear tendency to increased yields from 1980 to 1993, after which there has been a continuous decline in yields at the national average level. Regionally, the trends in turnip rapeseed yield show large variation, so that in six provinces of Finland, the trend has been significantly decreasing; in five provinces, there has been no significant trend; and in two provinces, there has been a significant linear increase in yields. Yield trends in the two other insect-pollinated crops, caraway and black currants, show similar trend variations. However, at the national average level, caraway yields show no significant trend, while black currant yields have increased during the past 6 years. The possible impact on the trends of insect-pollinated crops of three explanatory variables was analyzed. Significant linear correlation was found between the yield trends (slope of the trends) in rapeseed, and the extent of using neonicotinoid seed dressing in the provinces; the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed increased, as the use of neonicotinoid seed dressing increased. Similar significant linear correlation was found for the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed and the complexity of the agricultural landscape in each province; yield trend changed from negative to positive as the proportion of agricultural land of the total terrestrial land area declined from 28% to below 10%. The availability of honey bee colonies with respect to the growing area of crops benefitting from insect pollination also had a linear, significant impact on turnip rapeseed yield trends: yields tended to decline in provinces, where the supply of managed pollinators with respect to demand was low, but tended to increase in provinces, where the number of honey bee colonies were over 30% of the estimated demand. As neither the landscape complexity (proportion of arable land of total terrestrial land area), nor the number of honey bee colonies for pollination have changed significantly over the past 10-20 years, these factors cannot explain the observed differences in the yield trends of the examined insect-pollinated crops. It appears that only the uptake of neonicotinoid insecticide seed dressing about 15 years ago can explain the crop yield declines in several provinces, and at the national level for turnip rapeseed, most likely via disruption of pollination services by wild pollinators.","long-term yield trends of insect-pollinated crops vary regionally and are","Time series data on crop yields for two main wind-pollinated"

In Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) introduced populations typically lack intraspecific aggression, but native populations display such behavior commonly. We employ three approaches to examine how this behavioral shift might influence interspecific competitive ability. In a laboratory experiment, we reared colonies of Forelius mccooki with pairs of Argentine ant colonies that either did or did not exhibit intraspecific aggression. F. mccooki reared with intraspecifically non-aggressive pairs of Argentine ants produced fewer eggs, foraged less actively, and supported fewer living workers than those reared with intraspecifically aggressive pairs. At natural contact zones between competing colonies of L. humile and F. mccooki, the introduction of experimental Argentine ant colonies that fought with conspecific field colonies caused L. humile to abandon baits in the presence of F. mccooki, whereas the introduction of colonies that did not fight with field colonies of Argentine ants resulted in L. humile retaining possession of baits. Additional evidence for the potential importance of colony- structure variation comes from the Argentine ant's native range. At a site along the Rio de la Plata in Argentina, we found an inverse relationship between ant richness and density of L. humile (apparently a function of local differences in colony structure) in two different years of sampling.","colony-structure variation and interspecific competitive ability in the invasive argentine","The success of some invasive species may depend on phenotypic"

Our aims were to find how, and at which spatial scale of the landscape, the biodiversity of a rural agricultural landscape of a central European country (Czech Republic) is affected by land use. We used a multi-taxa approach based on six taxa, namely (i) birds, (ii) bees and wasps, (iii) beetles, (iv) butterflies, (v) land snails, and (vi) plants, in 25 traditional fruit orchards. We carried out spatial partitioning of three different types of land use (orchards, deciduous woodlands and grasslands) with radii ranging from 200 m to 3200 m. With respect to land use, the spatial partitioning showed that land snails, and bees and wasps were influenced to the lowest area of surrounding land use types, followed by beetles, butterflies and plants, and finally birds. Species richness in most of the taxa studied was enhanced by an increase in the area covered by orchards in the surrounding landscape. Our findings support the idea that multi-taxa responses to land use in landscape studies should be measured at different scales, for example, by making use of spatial partitioning.

Since so far the evidence for monocausal explanations is equivocal, involvement of multiple stressors is generally assumed. We here focus on various aspects of forage availability, which have received less attention than other stressors because it is virtually impossible to explore them empirically. We applied the colony model BEEHAVE, which links within-hive dynamics and foraging, to stylized landscape settings to explore how foraging distance, forage supply, and “forage gaps”, i.e. periods in which honeybees cannot find any nectar and pollen, affect colony resilience and the mechanisms behind. We found that colony extinction was mainly driven by foraging distance, but the timing of forage gaps had strongest effects on time to extinction. Sensitivity to forage gaps of 15 days was highest in June or July even if otherwise forage availability was sufficient to survive. Forage availability affected colonies via cascading effects on queen's egg-laying rate, reduction of new-emerging brood stages developing into adult workers, pollen debt, lack of workforce for nursing, and reduced foraging activity. Forage gaps in July led to reduction in egg-laying and increased mortality of brood stages at a time when the queen's seasonal egg-laying rate is at its maximum, leading to colony failure over time. Our results demonstrate that badly timed forage gaps interacting with poor overall forage supply reduce honeybee colony resilience. Existing regulation mechanisms which in principle enable colonies to cope with varying forage supply in a given landscape and year, such as a reduction in egg-laying, have only a certain capacity. Our results are hypothetical, as they are obtained from simplified landscape settings, but they are consistent with existing empirical knowledge. They offer ample opportunities for testing the predicted effects of forage stress in controlled experiments. © 2015 The Authors","multiple stressors: using the honeybee model beehave to explore how","The causes underlying the increased mortality of honeybee Apis mellifera"

We tested how a range of conspecifics on flowers affected on which flowers foraging honey bees landed. We trained students from a biology class for non-STEM majors to collect data and tested whether the number of conspecifics on flowers influences on which flower foragers land. We found that foragers land more frequently on flowers occupied by more conspecifics, which supports the hypothesis that conspecifics are cues for local enhancement.

The alternative patterns for the training included previously identified cues. They were: an oblique bar, three parallel oblique bars, an oblique grating, a square cross, six spokes, a large or a small spot, a spotty modulation, or a ring. The trained bees were given a variety of interleaved tests to discover the labels they had used to identify the patterns. A label is defined as the coincidence of cues that contributed to the recognition of a single landmark. The bees learned, firstly, the black area at the expected place, secondly, modulation caused by edges at the expected place. These cues were quantified and always available. In addition, the orientation cue was learned from a grating that covered the target, but was ignored in a single bar. The bees learned the positions of the centres of black and of radial symmetry. In tests, they also recognized unfamiliar cues that were not displayed in the training. The cues and preferences were similar to those used to discriminate between two targets.

At each choice point, they recognize a few cues in the range of positions where the cues occurred during the learning process. There is no need to postulate that they re-assemble the surrounding panorama in memory; only that they retain memories of the coincidences of cues in the expected retinotopic directions. The cues could be stimuli that excite groups of peripheral visual neurons. All the experimentally known cues are described, including modulation of the receptors, the locations of areas of black or colour, the nearness, size, averaged edge orientation, and radial and tangential edges. Cues of each type are separately summed within large fields, the size of which varies with the cue. Local orientation cues from edges at right angles cancel each other within each field, which also suggests that the discrimination of shape and texture is limited. Resolution depends on lateral interactions and the number of ommatidia required for each cue. To identify a new place, a few sparse cues, together with their directions, are learned in orientation flights. When the bee returns, the cues in the panorama are progressively matched as they coincide with the cues in memory.

"752","Hou C., Zhang X.","the influence of diversity changes of ecological conditions on the survival of honey bees",2011,"Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica","","Honey bees are essential species of ecological chain which play an important role in pollination in the whole ecosystem. By far the most important contribution honey bees make to modern agriculture is the pollination services that they provide. Fifty-two of the 115 leading global food commodities depend on honey bee pollination for either fruit or seed set. Honey bee is the most ideal pollinator, and honey bee industry has played a vital role in maintenance of environment development and protection of ecological equilibrium. At present, propaganda should be vigorously carried out on the role of honey bee pollination in increasing agriculture production and protection of ecological equilibrium. Honey bees are a greatly valued resource all of the world. They are prized for their honey and wax production and depended upon for pollination of many important crops. While globally honey bee populations have been increasing, the rate of increase is not keeping pace with demand. Further, honey bee populations have not been increasing in all parts of the world, and have declined in many nations in Europe and in North America. In recent year, CCD has broken out many times in the global range, and the population number of honey bees has sharply declined, so the situation is worrisome. Managed honey bee populations are influenced by many factors including diseases, parasites, pesticides, the environment, and socio-economic factors. These factors can act alone or in combination with each other. Modern agriculture increasingly depends on the use of chemical substances to control weeds, fungi and arthropod pests to ensure high yields. Honey bees may frequently become exposed to environmental chemicals as a consequence of their foraging activities, and traditionally, the focus of pesticide regulations was more on protection of bees against direct poisoning. However, since the substances that are being used have changed, damage from acute toxicity is not the only threat to bees. Instead, sub-lethal effects such as paralysis, disorientation or behavioral changes, both from short-term and long-term exposure, increasingly come into focus. In contrast to direct poisoning of bees that is apparent and easily observable, sub-lethal effects of pesticides on honey bees and other pollinators are much more difficult to demonstrate. The evolution of beekeeping as a cultural practice and as a profession has resulted in the development and use of techniques that may ultimately reduce the vitality of honey bee colonies. Selective pressures on the bee population are routinely being influenced by management decisions like the regular use of medication to control parasites and diseases, the protection of hives against cold weather, and artificial feeding. Consequently, weak and susceptible colonies are kept alive and given a chance to participate in the reproductive process. Colonies that were treated against diseases or parasites may be selected over non-treated colonies that have been forced to cope with the pathogens, thereby lowering the natural resistance against diseases and other environmental selection factors in the honey bee population. With the development of modern agriculture, the traditional survival conditions for honey bees are destroyed in China, which has threatened the existence and sustainable development of the honeybees, evidenced by the constant substantial decreases in the number of honeybees. This review summarizes the changes in ecological conditions, introduces the main factors affecting the survival of honeybees, analyzes the reasons behind the difficult survival of honeybees, and based on which several countermeasures have been raised to address the problem as well as how to maintain strong honeybee colonies, as a reference for future research.","the influence of diversity changes of ecological conditions on the","Honey bees are essential species of ecological chain which play"

Fewer than 8% of individual insects were found to be carrying single‐species pollen exclusively and none could be described as specialist pollen foragers. The introduced honeybee carried greater quantities of pollen than any native species but was not necessarily a reliable pollinator. The brief flowering periods in Neolitsea dealbata (3–4 weeks) and Litsea leefeana (4–5 weeks) populations were synchronized among individuals. Flowering in the Diospyros pentamera population extended over 15 weeks and most individuals were in flower for most of this period. Staminate trees began flowering earlier, produced more flowers and attracted relatively more insects than did pistillate trees, suggesting a density‐dependent response of pollinators to flowering performance. Pollen was trapped in greater quantities on insects at staminate trees than at pistillate trees. Insect numbers increased at peak flowering periods and Diptera were the most abundant flower visitors. Anthophilous Coleoptera were more numerous at staminate than at pistillate trees in all three tree species populations. Larger quantities of pollen were mobilized during peak flowering times although the greatest quantities were transferred to pistillate canopies towards the end of the population flowering periods. Diptera carried pollen more often to pistillate N. dealbata and L. leefeana trees than did other groups whereas Coleoptera carried pollen more often to pistillate D. pentamera trees. The two contrasting flowering performances in the three tree species are discussed with reference to mechanisms that facilitate pollen transfer between staminate and pistillate trees.

One possible mechanism by which bees could discriminate between flowers before visiting them is by detecting nectar via its odours. To test this idea, we observed visits by solitary bees in the genus Osmia (Megachilidae) to flowers of Penstemon caesius (Scrophulariaceae) in the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California. We observed that free-foraging Osmia bees visited flowers containing nectar seven times more frequently than they visited nectar-depleted flowers. To test whether bees could detect the presence of nectar via odour cues, we compared floral preferences between trials where we blocked the olfactory capabilities of bees by coating their antennae with nontoxic silicone and where bees foraged with uncovered antennae. We randomly assigned the order of the silicone treatments and attempted to test 32 bees at P. caesius arrays containing nectar-depleted flowers, nectar-depleted flowers with added water and nectar-rewarding control flowers. Bees with uncovered antennae visited more than twice as many control flowers as they did either group of nectar-depleted flowers. In contrast, bees foraging with silicone-covered antennae visited all treatment flowers equally. Bees that completed both trials visited nectar-rewarding control flowers twice as frequently while foraging with uncovered antennae as they did while foraging with silicone-coated antennae. These results are consistent with the idea that solitary Osmia bees are capable of perceiving nectar volatiles to identify nectar-rewarding Penstemon flowers. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","osmia bees (hymenoptera: megachilidae) can detect nectar-rewarding flowers using olfactory","Nectar-foraging bees frequently face the choice of which flowers to"

Although cross-pollination in commercial canola (Brassica napus) fields has been empirically measured, field trials are expensive and do not identify the causes of cross-pollination. Therefore, theoretical models can be valuable because they can provide estimates of cross-pollination at any given site and time. We present a general analytical model of field-to-field gene flow due to the following competing mechanisms: the wind, bees, and autonomous pollination. We parameterize the model for the particular case of field-to-field cross-pollination of genetically modified (GM) canola via the wind and via bumble bees (Bombus spp.) and honey bees (Apis mellifera). We make extensive use of the large data set of bee densities collected during the recent U.K. Farm Scale Evaluations. We predict that canola approaches almost full seed set without pollinators and that autonomous pollination is responsible for >= 25% of seed set, irrespective of pollinator abundance. We do not predict the relative contribution of bees vs. the wind in landscape-scale gene flow in canola. However, under model assumptions, we predict that the maximum field-to-field gene flow due to humble bees is 0.04% and 0.13% below the current EU limit for adventitious G M presence for winter and spring-sown canola, respectively. We predict that gene flow due to bees is similar to 3.1 times higher at 20% compared to 100% male-fertility, and due to the wind, 1.3 times higher at 20% compared to 100% male-fertility, for both winter- and spring-sown canola. Butuble bee-mediated gene flow is similar to 2.7 times higher and wind-mediated gene flow similar to 1.7 times lower in spring-sown than in winter-sown canola, regardless of the degree of male-sterility. The model of cross-pollination due to the wind most closely predicted three previously published observations: field-to-field gene flow is low; gene flow increases with the proportion of plants that are male-sterile; and gene flow is higher in winter- than in spring-sown canola. Our results therefore suggest that the wind, not bees, is the main vector of long-distance gene flow in canola.","effect of pollinator abundance on self-fertilization and gene flow: application","Cross-pollination from fields of transgenic crops is of great public"

In addition to indicating the position (distance, direction) of a food patch, both the occurrence and frequency of the dances depend on the profitability of the exploited resource (sugar concentration, solution flow rate). During the waggle dance, successful foragers generate pulsed thoracic vibrations that putatively serve as a source of different kinds of information for hive bees, who cannot visually decode dances in the darkness of the hive. In the present study, we asked whether these vibrations are a reliable estimator of the excitement of the dancer when food profitability changes in terms of both sugar concentration and solution flow rate. The probability of producing thoracic vibrations as well as several features related to their intensity during the waggle phase (pulse duration, velocity amplitude, duty cycle) increased with both these profitability variables. The number of vibratory pulses, however, was independent of sugar concentration and reward rate exploited. Thus, pulse number could indeed be used by dance followers as reliable information about food source distance, as suggested in previous studies. The variability of the dancer's thoracic vibrations in relation to changes in food profitability suggests their role as an indicator of the recruiter's motivational state. Hence, the vibrations could make an important contribution to forager reactivation and, consequently, to the organisation of collective foraging processes in honey bees. © 2011.

The temporal pattern of these vibrations correlates with the sugar concentration of the collected food. One possible pathway for transfering such information to nestmates is through airborne sound. In the present study, we investigated the transformation of thoracic vibrations into air particle velocity, sound pressure, and jet airflows in the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris. Whereas particle velocity and sound pressure were found all around and above vibrating individuals, there was no evidence for a jet airflow as with honey bees. The largest particle velocities were measured 5 mm above the wings (16.0±4.8 mm s-1). Around a vibrating individual, we found maximum particle velocities of 8.6±3.0 mm s-1 (horizontal particle velocity) in front of the bee's head and of 6.0±2.1 mm s-1 (vertical particle velocity) behind its wings. Wing oscillations, which are mainly responsible for air particle movements in honey bees, significantly contributed to vertically oriented particle oscillations only close to the abdomen in M. scutellaris (distances ≤5 mm). Almost 80% of the hive bees attending trophallactic food transfers stayed within a range of 5 mm from the vibrating foragers. It remains to be shown, however, whether air particle velocity alone is strong enough to be detected by Johnston's organ of the bee antenna. Taking the physiological properties of the honey bee's Johnston's organ as the reference, M. scutellaris hive bees are able to detect the forager vibrations through particle movements at distances of up to 2 cm.","the sound field generated by tethered stingless bees (melipona scutellaris):","In stingless bees, recruitment of hive bees to food sources"

For a traditional harmonic radar, the leakage signals should be suppressed to a sensitivity lower than -106 dBm to avoid interference. The proposed radar requires only attenuation of leakage signals to a level lower than -8 dBm to avoid low-noise amplifier saturation. Harmonic radar transponders are compatible with the proposed radar system without additional design.

In addition, the breeding system was investigated during 2004 and 2005 in populations from the Yulong Shan range, Lijiang County of Yunnan Province, China. Key results – Limonene was the dominant floral scent compound, accounting for 41.2%, followed by α-pinene, diacetone alcohol and myrcene.

Likely reasons are that honey bees can hardly be excluded from controls and wild bee nests are generally difficult to detect in field experiments. The goal of this study was to investigate whether red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) compete with honey bees in cages in order to compare the reproduction of red mason bees under different honey bee densities. Three treatments were applied, each replicated in four cages of 18m(3) with 38 red mason bees in all treatments and 0, 100, and 300 honey bees per treatment with 10-20% being foragers. Within the cages, the flower visitation and interspecific displacements from flowers were observed. Niche breadths and resource overlaps of both bee species were calculated, and the reproduction of red mason bees was measured. Red mason bees visited fewer flowers when honey bees were present. Niche breadth of red mason bees decreased with increasing honey bee density while resource overlaps remained constant. The reproduction of red mason bees decreased in cages with honey bees. In conclusion, our experimental results show that in small and isolated flower patches, wild bees can temporarily suffer from competition with honey bees.

Additionally, we counted wild bee ground nests in sites that differ in their distance to the next hive and wild bee stem nests and stem-nesting bee species in sites with hives present and absent. We did not observe fewer honey bees or higher wild bee flower visits in sites with different distances to the next hive (up to 1,229 m).

The ability of pollinating insects to discover and evade their predators can affect plant–pollinator mutualisms and have cascading ecosystem effects. Pollinators will avoid flowers with predators, but it is not clear how far away they will move to continue foraging. If these distances are relatively small, the impact of predators on the plant–pollinator mutualism may be lessened. The plant could continue to receive some pollination, and pollinators would reduce the time and energy needed to search for another patch. 2. A native crab spider, Xysticus elegans, was placed on one cluster in a small array of Baccharis pilularis inflorescence clusters, and the preferred short-range foraging distances of naturally visiting pollinators was determined. 3. Nearly all pollinator taxa (honey bees, wasps, other Hymenoptera, and non-bombyliid flies) spent less time foraging on the predator cluster. 4.

As such, they are susceptible to perturbation by abundant, generalist, non-native pollinators such as the western honey bee (Apis mellifera), which can reach high abundances and visit flowers of many plant species in their expansive introduced range. Despite the prevalence of non-native honey bees, their effects on pollination mutualisms in natural ecosystems remain incompletely understood. Here, we contrast community-level patterns of floral visitation by honey bees with that of the diverse native pollinator fauna of southern California, USA. We show that the number of honey bees visiting plant species increases much more rapidly with flower abundance than does that of non-honey bee insects, such that the percentage of all visitors represented by honey bees increases with flower abundance. Thus, honey bees could disproportionately impact the most abundantly blooming plant species and the large numbers of both specialized and generalized pollinator species that they sustain.

However, knowledge of how the proteome controls MG development and functionality at the different physiological stages of worker bees is still lacking. We characterized and compared the proteome across different ages of MGs in Italian bees (ITBs) and Royal Jelly (RJ) bees (RJBs), the latter being a line bred for increasing RJ yield, originating from the ITB. All 2000 proteins that were shared by differently aged MGs in both bee lines (>4000 proteins identified in all) were strongly enriched in metabolizing protein, nucleic acid, small molecule, and lipid functional groups. The fact that these shared proteins are enriched in similar groups in both lines suggests that they are essential for basic cellular maintenance and MG functions. However, great differences were found when comparing the proteome across different MG phases in each line. In newly emerged bees (NEBs), the unique and highly abundant proteins were enriched in protein synthesis, cytoskeleton, and development related functional groups, suggesting their importance to initialize young MG development. In nurse bees (NBs), specific and highly abundant proteins were mainly enriched in substance transport and lipid synthesis, indicating their priority may be in priming high secretory activity in lipid synthesis as larval nutrition. The unique and highly abundant proteins in forager bees (FBs) were enriched in lipid metabolism, small molecule, and carbohydrate metabolism. This indicates their emphasis on 2-heptanone synthesis as an alarm pheromone to enhance colony defense or scent marker for foraging efficiency. Furthermore, a wide range of different biological processes was observed between ITBs and RJBs at different MG ages. Both bee stocks may adapt different proteome programs to drive gland development and functionality. The RJB nurse bee has reshaped its proteome by enhancing the rate of lipid synthesis and minimizing degradation to increase 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid synthesis, a major component of RJ, to maintain the desired proportion of lipids in increased RJ production. This study contributes a novel understanding of MG development and lipid metabolism, and a potential starting point for lipid or pheromone biochemists as well as developmental geneticists. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","proteomic analysis reveals the molecular underpinnings of mandibular gland development","The mandibular glands (MGs) of honeybee workers are vital for"

However, coexistence may be facilitated by prezygotic isolating mechanisms that reduce intercytotype mating and increase assortative mating. 2 We examined the ecological factors regulating intercytotype mating in Chamerion (formerly Epilobium) angustifolium by measuring floral morphology, flowering synchrony and insect foraging preferences in a mixed population within a diploid-tetraploid contact zone. We also calculated the minimum rate of between-cytotype mating from estimates of the frequency of triploid offspring. 3 Diploids had significantly shorter and narrower petals as well as shorter styles than tetraploids. Inflorescences were significantly taller in tetraploids than diploids, but the mean number of open flowers per inflorescence did not differ. Diploid and tetraploid flowering periods overlapped by 51%, with diploid stems flowering earlier. 4 In a plot of 20 diploid and 28 tetraploid stems that were flowering simultaneously, only 26% of all bee flights were between flowers on different stems. Of the total flights between inflorescences, only 15% were between different cytotypes. The combined effects of flowering asynchrony and insect foraging reduced the opportunities for intercytotype mating from 49% expected if mating is random to about 2% of the total number of pollinator flights. 5 A computer simulation indicated that the deficiency of pollinator flights between cytotypes was due largely to the spatial structure of cytotypes and limited pollinator flight distances within the observation plot. The frequency of triploid offspring produced during the period when both cytotypes were in flower was 6.6%, similar to the proportion of flights observed between flowers on different cytotypes (4%). 6 The results indicate that flowering phenology and insect behaviour (as influenced by clonal structure) have a significant effect on prezygotic mating isolation and triploid production, and may contribute to the maintenance of mixed cytotype populations in Chamerion angustifolium.","ecological mechanisms of reproductive isolation between diploid and tetraploid chamerion","1 Theoretical models indicate that coexistence of diploid and polyploid"

Here we study the effect of host colony density and host genetic variability on N. bombi infections in natural populations of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We sampled males and workers from six B. terrestris populations located in an agricultural landscape in Middle Sweden to determine the prevalence and degree of N. bombi infections. All individuals were genotyped with five microsatellite markers to infer the colony densities in the sampled populations and the genetic variability of the host population. We confirmed that genetic variability and sex significantly correlate with the degree of infection with N. bombi.

The innate immune system includes the circulating hemocytes (immune cells) that clear pathogens from hemolymph (blood) by phagocytosis, nodulation or encapsulation. Honey bee hemocyte numbers have been linked to hemolymph levels of vitellogenin. Vitellogenin is a multifunctional protein with immune-supportive functions identified in a range of species, including the honey bee. Hemocyte numbers can increase via mitosis, and this recruitment process can be important for immune system function and maintenance. Here, we tested if hemocyte mediated phagocytosis differs among the physiologically different honey bee worker castes (nurses, foragers and winter bees), and study possible interactions with vitellogenin and hemocyte recruitment. To this end, we adapted phagocytosis assays, which—together with confocal microscopy and flow cytometry—allow qualitative and quantitative assessment of hemocyte performance. We found that nurses are more efficient in phagocytic uptake than both foragers and winter bees. We detected vitellogenin within the hemocytes, and found that winter bees have the highest numbers of vitellogenin-positive hemocytes. Connections between phagocytosis, hemocyte-vitellogenin and mitosis were worker caste dependent. Our results demonstrate that the phagocytic performance of immune cells differs significantly between honey bee worker castes, and support increased immune competence in nurses as compared to forager bees.

The previous study revealed that red-phase flowers no longer have sexual function and nectar, and bumblebees selectively visit yellow-phase flowers. The present study examined how retaining color-changed flowers can regulate the foraging behavior of bumblebees and pollen transport among flowers within (geitonogamous pollination) and between (outcrossing pollination) plants and how the behavior is influenced by display size (i. e., number of functional flowers) and visitation frequency. The visitation frequencies of bumblebees to plants and successive flower probes within plants were observed in the field using plants whose flower number and composition of the two color-phase flowers had been manipulated. To evaluate pollination efficiency over multiple pollinator visits, a pollen transport model was constructed based on the observed bumblebee behavior. In the simulation, three flowering patterns associated with display size and existence of color-changed flowers were postulated as follows: Type 1, large display (100 functional flowers) and no retention of color-changed flowers; Type 2, small display (50 functional flowers) and retention of color-changed flowers (50 old flowers), and; Type 3, large display (100 functional flowers) and retention of color-changed flowers (100 old flowers). Color-changed flowers did not contribute to increasing bumblebee attraction at a distance but reduced the number of successive flower probes within plants. Comparisons of pollen transfer between Types 1 and 3 revealed that the retention of color-changed flowers did not influence the total amount of pollen exported when pollinator visits were abundant (>100 visits) but decreased geitonogamous pollination. Comparisons between Types 2 and 3 revealed that the discouragement effect of floral color change on successive probes accelerated in plants with a large display size. Overall, the floral color change strategy contributed to reduce geitonogamous pollination, but its effectiveness was highly sensitive to display size and pollinator frequency. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","modification of bumblebee behavior by floral color change and implications","Flowers of Weigela middendorffiana change the color from yellow to"

Experiments with bees provide evidence that flying insects might be using optical flow induced by egomotion to estimate distance traveled. Recently some details of this `odometer' have been unraveled. In this study, we propose a biologically inspired model of the bee's visual `odometer' based on Elementary Motion Detectors (EMDs), and present results from goal-directed navigation experiments with an autonomous flying robot platform that we developed specifically for this purpose. The robot is equipped with a panoramic vision system, which is used to provide input to the EMDs of the left and right visual fields. The outputs of the EMDs are in later stage spatially integrated by wide field motion detectors, and their accumulated response is directly used for the odometer. In a set of initial experiments, the robot moves through a corridor on a fixed route, and the outputs of EMDs, the odometer, are recorded. The results show that the proposed model can be used to provide an estimate of the distance traveled, but the performance depends on the route the robot follows, something which is biologically plausible since natural insects tend to adopt a fixed route during foraging. Given these results, we assumed that the optomotor response plays an important role in the context of goal-directed navigation, and we conducted experiments with an autonomous freely flying robot. The experiments demonstrate that this computationally cheap mechanism can be successfully employed in natural indoor environments.","navigation in an autonomous flying robot by using a biologically","While mobile robots and walking insects can use proprioceptive information"

Temporal variation in floral resources may influence the population dynamics of pollinators. We investigated the relationship between the population dynamics of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) and canopy floral resources over 5 years in a cool temperate forest. We predicted that the yearly fluctuation of canopy resources affects colony development and queen production, resulting in the variation of the pollination success of understorey plants the following spring. Flower production of canopy trees showed clear biyearly fluctuations, synchronously among most species. Worker production of Bombus ardens and Bombus hypocrita were positively related to floral resources during colony establishment by overwintered queens, while that of Bombus diversus was positively related to floral resources during the worker-active period. An abundance of overwintered queens was positively related to both worker abundance and floral resources in the previous summer in B. ardens and to only previous-year worker abundance in B. hypocrita but was dependent on neither factor in B. diversus. These differences in causal effects on queen production among species might be a reflection of interspecific differences in the degree of dependence on canopy resources for queen production due to species-specific phenologies and/or foraging preferences of other species of flowers. The extent of pollen limitation in the spring-ephemeral Corydalis ambigua, which is exclusively pollinated by overwintered queens, was negatively correlated with the abundance of B. hypocrita queens. Thus, population dynamics of bumble bees has a crucial effect on seed production of understorey plants. Synthesis. The dynamics of flower production in overstory trees can indirectly affect the pollination efficiency of understorey plants in the next season via the population dynamics of pollinators.

The widespread distribution of this orchid species (or species complex) suggests that there may be a number of different model and pollinator species throughout this range, and that additional studies are necessary to characterise its pollination adequately. In this study, the pollination of D. maculata in the Sydney region, mainly at Scheyville National Park, was compared with the results previously obtained in Victoria. At Scheyville National Park, Trichocolletes venustus was the only native bee species found in significant numbers, and the flowers it visited were almost exclusively the legumes Hardenbergia violacea and Daviesia ulicifolia ssp. ulicifolia. Fifty per cent (14 of 28) of captured male bees carried D. maculata orchid pollinaria, or remnants, which were identified by AFLP fingerprinting. Female bees, which appeared about 10?14 days after males, were not observed visiting the orchid or carrying orchid pollinaria. We confirmed that D. maculata flowers lack nectar, and noted that the pea-like flowers possess an UV false nectar guide comparable to the true UV nectar guide of the legume flowers. Colorimetric analysis showed the colour separation between D. ulicifolia ssp. ulicifolia and the orchid is small enough to be likely to produce foraging errors, consistent with mimicry. We conclude that guild mimicry of a diversity of 'egg and bacon' legumes best explains the pollination of D. maculata s.l., rather than precise mimicry of any one pea species. Preliminary observations suggest that pea-flower mimicry may range from being highly precise in some species, through to being much more generalised, but still retaining elements of mimicry. The novel finding of comparable UV patterns in Diuris species and putative pea models applies to most species in the genus and we found that the rare D. aequalis shows remarkable similarity in colour, shape and UV patterns to the sympatric legume Gompholobium huegelii, and is likely to be a mimic of this species. © CSIRO 2006.","pollination of diuris maculata (orchidaceae) by male trichocolletes venustus bees","In a previous study, the Australian terrestrial orchid Diuris maculata"

The proposed methodology is developed on the basics of a new swarm based Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm combined with two-step constrained local search for neighborhood selection. VRPSTW involves computing the routes of a set of vehicles with fixed capacity from a central depot to a set of geographically dispersed customers with known demands and predefined time windows. Here, the time window constraints are relaxed into ""soft"", that is penalty terms are added to the solution cost whenever a vehicle serves a customer outside of his time window. The solution of routing problems with soft time windows has valuable practical applications. This paper uses a direct interpretation of the VRPSTW as a multi-objective optimization problem where the total traveling distance, number of window violations and number of required vehicles are minimized while capacity and time window constraints are met. Our work aims at using ABC inspired foraging behavior of honey bees which balances exploration and exploitation to avoid local optima and reach the global optima. The algorithm is applied to solve the well known benchmark Solomon's problem instances. Experimental results show that our suggested approach is quite effective, as it provides solutions that are competitive with the best known results in the literature.

Pollen movement has primarily been studied as a function of the direct relationships between plants and pollinators; however, nonpollinating floral visitors, such as some nectar robbers, may have indirect effects on pollen dispersal by altering plant - pollinator interactions. Theory predicts that nectar robbing should have indirect positive effects on plants by increasing pollen dispersal distance and reducing self-pollen transfer (geitonogamy) and inbreeding through changes in pollinator behavior associated with reduced nectar rewards. Here I experimentally tested the indirect effects of the nectar-robbing bumble bee, Bombus occidentalis, on the distance of pollen movement among plants and levels of pollen movement within plants (estimated using powdered fluorescent dyes as pollen analogues) using the self-incompatible, hummingbird-pollinated host, Ipomopsis aggregata. Empirical results did not fully support the theoretical predictions. Heavy levels of nectar (>80% of available flowers robbed) had no effect on the mean and mean-squared distance of dye dispersal within populations. However, hummingbird pollinators were 50% more likely to depart from a population after visiting a plant with low robbing relative to a plant with high robbing, suggesting that pollen dispersal among populations might be reduced in plants with high robbing relative to plants with low robbing. Heavy nectar robbing reduced levels of self-dye transfer by one-half. However, when I manipulated robbing levels and access to self-pollen, the costs associated with increased robbing and reduced pollinator visitation (e.g., reduced seed production) outweighed any advantages associated with reduced geitonogamy. Taken together, these results suggest that the negative indirect effects of robbing on plant reproduction through decreased pollinator visitation and changes in pollinator departure from plants far exceed any positive effects associated with decreased geitonogamy. Given the widespread nature of plant attack by nectar robbers, these indirect effects are likely common phenomena structuring natural plant populations.","impact of nectar robbing on estimates of pollen flow: conceptual","Pollen movement within and among plants affects levels of inbreeding"

However, these differences were not statistically significant and no marked differences in pollen dispersal distances were observed between the two morphs. 6 Our results suggest that the presence of opposite-morph genets within several metres is essential for success of seed reproduction in P. sieboldii, irrespective of population density, and that stochastic deviation of the morph ratio in small populations is therefore likely to cause considerable reduction in seed set. © 2006 British Ecological Society.","effects of density and floral morph on pollen flow and","1 We assessed the effects of population density and the"

In this study, I extracted this overstrike effect on the plant choices of pollinators by analyzing patterns of visitation sequences within a single round-trip between the hive and foraging patch (bout). First, I simulated the visitation sequences within single bouts with a model to show how factors, including the bees' plant-type preferences, the arrangement of plants and the effect of overstrike on short-term memory, affect visitation sequences. Here, bees are assumed to forage in a patch consisting of two plant types (H and L). The model predicts that only the effect of overstrike on short-term memory causes assorted visitation sequences according to plant type (within-bout flower constancy). That is, if the overstrike-effect on short-term memory is the primary determinant of plant choice, then bees will fly to a type-L plant after visiting a type-L plant even if they predominantly visit type-H plants and vice versa. Next, I investigated individual bumblebees' visitation sequences at a patch of artificial inflorescences with a set-up similar to that assumed in the model. Two types of inflorescences were arranged on a Cartesian grid. Assorted visitation sequences according to inflorescence type were observed, depending on the distances among inflorescences. This result supports the hypotheses that bees fly to the same plant type as that last visited because short-term memory is displaced (overstruck) with information about the most recently visited plant type. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","analysis of bumblebee visitation sequences within single bouts: implication of","Pollinators whose foraging habitats consist of several plant types (species"

One explanation for flower constancy is that pollinators use the search image of a specific flower type to efficiently find flowers because they are often cryptic. The so-called search image hypothesis predicts that temporal specialization to 1 flower type by an individual pollinator declines as flower conspicuousness increases because if flowers are conspicuous, pollinators can divide their attention among different flower types. To test this prediction, we investigated visitation sequences of individual bumble bees (Bombus ignitus) to a patch of blue and yellow artificial flowers. We used different flower sizes and interflower distances as independent determinants of flower visual size and noisiness of the background and, thus, of flower crypsis. Flower color selectivity and flower search time decreased and subsequently increased with visual size of the nearest flowers, with a minimum of approximately 15 degrees of the visual angle. Within-bout constancy, measured as the tendency of flying to the same flower types in succession compared with the expectation of a given flower selectivity within a bout, increased with visual size of the nearest flowers. Flower selectivity and within-bout constancy did not differ among arrays that shared the same floral visual angle, indicating that visual size, rather than flight distance or flower size itself, had a substantial effect on flower choices. Our results suggest that flower visual size and background noisiness affect flower crypsis and constancy, providing support for the search image hypothesis.","effect of flower visual angle on flower constancy: a test","Pollinators often sequentially visit 1 flower type while bypassing other"

Each bee species has long been reported to exhibit unique foraging patterns and time, and it is very likely that bee foraging activities play a significant role in the phenolic composition of honeys. This work aims to justify the potential relationship between species-specific foraging activities and phenolic composition of honeys, to distinguish polyphenolic profiles and to identify possible floral markers in each type of Malaysian honey studied. Seventeen samples of Malaysian gelam, acacia, nenas, tualang, and kelulut honeys were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Total phenolic contents ranged from 1.92 to 14.84 mg/g of honey, in nenas and gelam honey, respectively. Fifteen phenolic compounds were identified, probably affected by the bee foraging preference. The highest number was seen in kelulut honey (Trigona spp.) while the lowest were in tualang honey (10 compounds, Apis dorsata). Apis cerana indica showed the highest phenolic acid and flavonoid contents (8.74 mg/g honey) compared to the other bee species, probably due to less selective floral preference, longer duration and early foraging time as well as small body size that influence their foraging activity. Similarity in two dominant polyphenols from polyhenolic profiles between acacia and tualang honeys (naringenin and ellagic acid), and between gelam and kelulut honeys (ellagic acid and benzoic acid) suggesting that the floral source of unifloral honey is an equally important food source for the analyzed multifloral honey, was confirmed by PCA analysis. This work assumes that competition between bee species for nectar and pollen might exist, affecting honey production and total polyphenolic content. From the results, some polyphenolic profiles could be regarded as possible floral markers of Malaysian unifloral honeys, with very consistent profiles observed in nenas honeys.","apini and meliponini foraging activities influence the phenolic content of","Malaysian honeys are produced by two main bee genera: Apis"

Pollen colour in Campanula americana is variable and displays a longitudinal cline from prevalence of deep purple in western populations to white and light-purple pollen in eastern populations. While selection for thermal tolerance probably underlies darker pollen in the west, factors contributing to the predominance of light pollen in eastern populations and the maintenance of colour variation within populations throughout the range are unknown. Here we examine whether pollinators contribute to the maintenance of pollen colour variation in C. americana. • Methods In a flight cage experiment, we assessed whether Bombus impatiens foragers can use pollen colour as a reward cue. We then established floral arrays that varied in the frequency of white- and purple-pollen plants in two naturally occurring eastern populations. We observed foraging patterns of wild bees, totalling >1100 individual visits. • Key Results We successfully trained B. impatiens to prefer one pollen colour morph. In natural populations, the specialist pollinator, Megachile campanulae, displayed a strong and consistent preference for purple-pollen plants regardless of morph frequency. Megachile also exhibited a bias toward pollen-bearing male-phase flowers, and this bias was more pronounced for purple pollen. The other main pollinators, Bombus spp. and small bees, did not display pollen colour preference. • Conclusions Previous research found that Megachile removes twice as much pollen per visit as other bees and can deplete pollen from natural populations. Taken together, these results suggest that Megachile could reduce the reproductive success of plants with purple pollen, resulting in the prevalence of light-coloured pollen in eastern populations of C. americana.

In plants, selection towards early flowering is commonly observed. Pollinator-mediated selection is hypothesized to be a pervasive evolutionary force acting directionally on flowering time. However, pollinator-mediated mechanisms have rarely been tested in realistic field conditions, especially in perennial plants visited by a diversity of generalist insect pollinators. We examined pollinator visitation in eight Echinacea angustifolia populations in western Minnesota, USA, to gauge the potential for pollinator-mediated selection. Echinacea is a common prairie perennial that persists in isolated remnant populations. Echinacea is self-incompatible and is pollinated by a diversity of generalist solitary bees. A previous study found that early flowering Echinacea plants have higher seed set and their reproduction is less pollen-limited than late flowering plants. Twelve times throughout a flowering season, we quantified pollinator visitation rates and pollinator community composition. In three sites, we also estimated the quality of pollinator visits by examining the composition of pollinators' pollen loads brought to Echinacea plants. We found that three aspects of pollination dramatically decreased over the course of the flowering season. 1) Pollinators visited early flowering plants more frequently than late flowering plants. 2) The pollinator community was also less diverse late in the flowering season and became dominated by a single species of small bee, Augochlorella aurata. 3) Pollinators visiting Echinacea late in the season carried proportionally less conspecific pollen compared to pollinators visiting Echinacea early in the flowering season. Understanding within-season dynamics of pollination helps predict the prevalence of inbreeding, phenological assortative mating, and reproductive failure, especially in fragmented plant populations.","pollinator-mediated mechanisms for increased reproductive success in early flowering plants","Mating activities change within a season in many animal and"

The native bee fauna of New Zealand is composed of short-tongued solitary bees in the families Colletidae and Halictidae. Long-tongued social bees were introduced 150 years ago, and Apis mellifera and Bombus species are now widespread. We analysed floral resource utilization by introduced bees (mainly Bombus terrestris) and native bees in relation to resource abundance across elevations in montane to alpine grassland communities. We modelled resource utilization and overlap between bee taxa using a novel index of floral resource availability, developed to more accurately describe floral density. Additionally, we sought to quantify the impact of honey bees by introducing hives, however, low densities in study plots prevented direct conclusions from being drawn. Native and introduced bees did, however, have distinctly different floral preferences over the flowering season with more niche overlap within, rather than between, native and introduced groups. Introduced bees showed a preference for introduced species in the family Fabaceae which native bees could not access. Native bees heavily utilized introduced Asteraceae as well as native floral resources that introduced bees did not prefer. The limited resource overlap between bee taxa indicated that bee communities in New Zealand may have reduced potential for competition, owing to the different resource requirements of solitary versus social bees and their differing abilities to access floral resources.

Their zygomorphic flowers have been the object of numerous studies in morphology, ecology, and developmental genetics, and new phylogenetic insights make it timely to synthesize knowledge about their evolution. Key features of Delphinieae flowers are unusual nectaries consisting of paired organs of the inner perianth whorl that are completely enclosed by a single dorsal organ of the outer whorl. We investigated the floral development of five annual, unicarpellate species of Delphinium, focusing on perianth organization. The results show that the nectar-storing organ in these species results from the postgenital fusion of two primordia of the internal perianth whorl. Eleven floral traits traced on a phylogeny of Delphinieae reveal only two homoplasies in the perianth, namely, the nightcap shape of the dorsal organ of the external perianth whorl and the reduction of the internal perianth whorl to two organs, traits that each evolved once in Aconitum and once in Delphinium. The length of the inner spur(s), the type of pollinator (bees, hummingbirds, hawkmoths), and species altitudinal ranges are unrelated, but most species are exclusively bumblebee adapted, and bee tongue lengths may match the internal nectar spur lengths. The paired inner spurs present in most Delphinieae require a back-and-forth movement of the tongue while the pollinator is inside the flower or hovering close to it. A new evolutionary scenario reconciles the diversity of perianth organization in Delphinieae with the tribe's conserved pollination mechanism.","spurs in a spur: perianth evolution in the delphinieae (ranunculaceae)","Delphinieae (Ranunculaceae) comprise; 650 species of temperate herbs in Eurasia,"

In the present study, the floral composition and diversity, flowering spectrum and availability of food resources in natural and man-made habitats in four rural municipalities in Lublin Upland, SE Poland were evaluated. The connection between pollinator-friendly biotopes was also determined and some suggestions are made on creation/supplementation of bee pastures adapted to the arable land structure in eastern Poland (mean acreage 7.65 ha). RESULTS: Forage species richness (S) differed among vegetation types: the highest S value was found in field margins, while mixed forests represented the lowest species richness (mean ± standard deviation = 37.8 ± 9.5 vs 16.5 ± 2.3). In all habitats, the most abundant flowering was recorded in May. Then the blooming abundance decreased until a complete decline at the end of summer. The mean distance between pollinator-friendly biotopes is 2.4 ± 1.53 km, which is out of the flying range/foraging distance of most pollinators. CONCLUSION: Shortages of nectar and pollen resources in the agricultural landscape of SE Poland are evident.

However, it is unclear whether foragers tune their excitatory and inhibitory signalling according to food value and predation risk. We therefore studied the signals that honeybee foragers perform before and after being attacked by live predators (wasps and spiders) or a robo-predator at a nectar source. Predator attacks significantly reduced recruitment dancing and increased stop signalling, which inhibits dancing for the dangerous resource. Attack equally reduced dancing for all sucrose concentrations. However, foragers factored travel costs into their positive signalling. At the feeder with greater travel cost (100. m), bees danced less when they responded more severely to attacks. At the low travel cost feeder (1. m), there was no significant effect of attack response severity upon dancing. Attacks increased inhibitory signal production. Live and robo-predator attacks elicited 131-fold more stop signals from foragers as compared to control treatments of freshly dead predators that did not attack. However, food profitability, distance and sucrose concentration did not alter stop signalling. We suggest that this pattern may generally characterize excitatory/inhibitory signal pairs in group foraging.

We focused on its reproductive biology and pollinator behavior to explain its reproductive success. We performed manual pollination and germination experiments, and monitored the behavior of C. retusa's main pollinators in monospecific plots, and in mixed plots where C. retusa occurred together with two congeners, Crotalaria pallida and Crotalaria lanceolata. Crotalaria retusa is self-compatible and capable of automatic selfing. Inbreeding depression was expressed at the level of percent seed germination, but not seed set. Few insects visited the inflorescences. Legitimate pollinators were two large carpenter bees, Xylocopa frontalis and Xylocopa grisescens which, together, accounted for more than 90 percent of the visits. The former foraged on C. retusa exclusively and has low pollen spread potential. The latter flew longer distances between plants and visited fewer flowers per inflorescence, potentially increasing the extent of pollen carryover, but at the risk of increasing heterospecific pollen transfer, because it visits other Crotalaria species during the same foraging bout. The different foraging strategies, allied to morphological disadvantages represented by pollen overlap on X. grisescens' body, may partially explain the much lower seed germination observed in C. pallida and C. lanceolata. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a reduction in flower constancy may significantly depress viable seed set by increasing the chances of self-pollination.","pollination biology of the exotic rattleweed crotalaria retusa l.

Primula vulgaris is a native perennial herb with a very wide distribution in the British Isles. In many lowland areas it is essentially a plant of woodlands and hedgerows, although in the west it can occur abundantly in grasslands and other communities such as heaths. In northern and western Britain and Ireland, it may be frequent in open and even exposed habitats. Its distribution is linked with soil moisture and atmospheric humidity. It is shade tolerant, but it ?owers most profusely in canopy gaps. 3. Primula vulgaris is a rosette hemicryptophyte that reproduces mainly through seeds. Vegetative spread is restricted and only occurs within very short distances from the mother plant through the production of lateral rosettes. Although individual rosettes may die, plants are relatively long-lived (life expectancy of a newborn individual: 48.3 years). The mean age at ?rst ?owering was 20 months. 4. Pollination is mainly by bumblebees and other bees, but other long-tongued pollinators including syrphids, bee-?ies and even butter?ies may be locally important. P. vulgaris is an obligate outbreeder, with two genetically determined self-incompatible morphs (pin and thrum). A third morph (homostyle or long homostyle), with a stigma like that of pin but anthers like that of thrum, has been found in Somerset and North Dorset. In years when pollinators are scarce, homostyles have higher reproductive success than pins and thrums, suggesting that reproductive assurance could have had a profound effect on the evolution of homostyly in P. vulgaris. 5. Seeds are dispersed by ants and rodents. Dispersal is usually restricted to a few centimetres or decimetres from maternal plants, resulting in signi?cant ?ne-scale spatial genetic structure and small neighbourhood sizes.

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Spiranthes spiralis (L.) Chevall. that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Spiranthes spiralis is a long-lived orchid species that is widely distributed in the southern part of the British Isles, southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is native to Britain. Its most characteristic habitats are unimproved, well-grazed grasslands on dry calcareous soils, particularly chalk and limestone, cliff-tops and grassy coastal dunes. It can also be found in garden lawns and, less frequently, in slightly acidic heathland habitat. It occurs on both dry and wet soils, but it does not tolerate heavy shading. 3. Spiranthes spiralis is a non-bulbous geophyte regenerating by sexual reproduction and by vegetative spread, although the latter is limited. Vegetative reproduction involves the growth of a lateral bud on the underground stem. The new plant forms its own tubers, and eventually the connection between the mother plant and the vegetatively produced daughter plant withers away. 4. The main perennating organ is a tuberous root. In most years, the tuber generates a rosette of expanded leaves, and at the end of every year of the plant's life, the tuber is completely replaced. In some cases, however, only part of the reserves is exhausted in flowering and, when this happens, a tuber may survive for several years. Vegetative adult dormancy - the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a growing season, followed by reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic plants in subsequent seasons - has been observed. It most commonly lasts for only 1 year, but sometimes plants can remain dormant for several years. 5. The species is not autogamous and pollinators - mainly bumblebees and bees - are necessary for successful pollination and fruit set. Natural levels of fruit set are usually <50%. Hand-pollination increases fruit set to c. 75%, indicating that reproduction is to some extent pollen-limited. Sexual reproduction comes at a cost, and few individuals flower for two or more consecutive years. Within fruits many very small seeds are produced, but most are dispersed to a distance of less than a few dm from maternal plants, leading to strongly aggregated distribution patterns and significant spatial genetic structuring within natural populations. 6. Spiranthes spiralis has suffered significant declines in distribution in Britain and other European countries. In Britain, populations were lost from many sites before 1930, when many pastures were re-sown or converted to arable land. Losses of populations due to agricultural intensification (ploughing of old fields and fertilization) still occur and are the major causes of the decline of the species. Conservation of remnant populations primarily requires the maintenance of a short turf by grazing, most often by sheep.

To fill this gap in pollinator decline censuses and to provide a broad picture of the current status of honeybees across their natural range, we used microsatellite genetic markers to estimate colony densities and genetic diversity at different locations in Europe, Africa, and central Asia that had different patterns of land use. Genetic diversity and colony densities were highest in South Africa and lowest in Northern Europe and were correlated with mean annual temperature. Confounding factors not related to climate, however, are also likely to influence genetic diversity and colony densities in honeybee populations. Land use showed a significantly negative influence over genetic diversity and the density of honeybee colonies over all sampling locations. In Europe honeybees sampled in nature reserves had genetic diversity and colony densities similar to those sampled in agricultural landscapes, which suggests that the former are not wild but may have come from managed hives. Other results also support this idea: putative wild bees were rare in our European samples, and the mean estimated density of honeybee colonies on the continent closely resembled the reported mean number of managed hives. Current densities of European honeybee populations are in the same range as those found in the adverse climatic conditions of the Kalahari and Saharan deserts, which suggests that beekeeping activities do not compensate for the loss of wild colonies. Our findings highlight the importance of reconsidering the conservation status of honeybees in Europe and of regarding beekeeping not only as a profitable business for producing honey, but also as an essential component of biodiversity conservation. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.","estimating the density of honeybee colonies across their natural range","Although pollinator declines are a global biodiversity threat, the demography"

Despite the ecological and economic importance of wild bees and the fact that several species are now managed for pollination services worldwide, little is known about how land use and beekeeping practices jointly influence gene flow. Using stingless bees as a model system, containing wild and managed species that are presumed to be particularly susceptible to habitat degradation, here we examine the main drivers of tropical bee gene flow. We employ a novel landscape genetic approach to analyse data from 135 populations of 17 stingless bee species distributed across diverse tropical biomes within the Americas. Our work has important methodological implications, as we illustrate how a maximum-likelihood approach can be applied in a meta-analysis framework to account for multiple factors, and weight estimates by sample size. In contrast to previously held beliefs, gene flow was not related to body size or deforestation, and isolation by geographic distance (IBD) was significantly affected by management, with managed species exhibiting a weaker IBD than wild ones. Our study thus reveals the critical importance of beekeeping practices in shaping the patterns of genetic differentiation across bee species. Additionally, our results show that many stingless bee species maintain high gene flow across heterogeneous landscapes. We suggest that future efforts to preserve wild tropical bees should focus on regulating beekeeping practices to maintain natural gene flow and enhancing pollinator-friendly habitats, prioritizing species showing a limited dispersal ability. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","beekeeping practices and geographic distance, not land use, drive gene","Across the globe, wild bees are threatened by ongoing natural"

Landscape genomics offers powerful tools to assess the influence of landscape modifications on genetic diversity and functional connectivity, and to identify adaptations to local environmental conditions that could facilitate future bee survival. Here, we assessed range-wide patterns of genetic structure, genetic diversity, gene flow, and local adaptation in the stingless bee Melipona subnitida, a tropical pollinator of key biological and economic importance inhabiting one of the driest and hottest regions of South America. Our results reveal four genetic clusters across the species’ full distribution range. All populations were found to be under a mutation–drift equilibrium, and genetic diversity was not influenced by the amount of reminiscent natural habitats. However, genetic relatedness was spatially autocorrelated and isolation by landscape resistance explained range-wide relatedness patterns better than isolation by geographic distance, contradicting earlier findings for stingless bees. Specifically, gene flow was enhanced by increased thermal stability, higher forest cover, lower elevations, and less corrugated terrains. Finally, we detected genomic signatures of adaptation to temperature, precipitation, and forest cover, spatially distributed in latitudinal and altitudinal patterns. Taken together, our findings shed important light on the life history of M. subnitida and highlight the role of regions with large thermal fluctuations, deforested areas, and mountain ranges as dispersal barriers.

No previous study has reported such a finding in adult insect locomotion. We used behavioural tracking to study walking Bombus terrestris in an arena under different training environments. Trajectories analysed from this tracking show the speed-curvature power law holds robustly at the population level, displaying an exponent close to two-thirds. This exponent corroborates previous findings in human movement patterns, but differs from the three-quarter exponent reported for Drosophila larval locomotion. There are conflicting hypotheses for the principal origin of these speed-curvature laws, ranging from the role of central planning to kinematic and muscular skeletal constraints. Our findings substantiate the latter idea that dynamic power-law effects are robust, differing only through kinematic constraints due to locomotive method. Our research supports the notion that these laws are present in a greater range of species than previously thought, even in the bumblebee. Such power laws may provide optimal behavioural templates for organisms, delivering a potential analytical tool to study deviations from this template.

Individuals that performed other tasks did not maintain a predictable distance to the centre, and there was no evidence that spatial preferences changed over time. Instead, spatial patterns may result from inherent differences between individuals in terms of activity level, and may be a self-organized sorting mechanism that influences division of labour among workers.","spatial organization and division of labour in the bumblebee bombus","Individuals in many types of animal groups show both reproductive"

However, workers in ant or bee colonies often vary in behaviour and morphology even when genetic variation is low. Bumblebees provide a unique opportunity to explore the consequences of such variation: colonies have a wide range of worker body sizes compared to other social bee species, and workers also vary in response thresholds (i.e. stimulus levels at which workers respond by performing a task), in spite of queens being singly mated (and thus, low genetic variation). Here we test how body size and response threshold diversity affect colony performance in two unrelated in-nest tasks (thermoregulation and undertaking). We manipulated worker diversity using worker removals to restrict threshold or body size variation within the colony. We also quantified the degree of intracolony variation across colonies and related this to colony performance. In general, colonies took longer to cool the nest after bees were removed, but there was no significant effect of treatment on fanning or undertaking success. Furthermore, when intracolony variation was analysed as a continuous variable, we found no effect on colony-level thermoregulation or undertaking performance. Instead, average threshold was a more useful predictor of thermoregulation success, and colonies with a narrower range of size variation had more success at undertaking. These results emphasize the importance of understanding how different types of variation (e.g. behavioural, morphological, etc.) contribute to colony performance.

Nevertheless, specialized thieves of the Neotropical ant, Ectatomma ruidum, also known as the thieving ant', regularly enter and steal resources from distinct, neighboring colonies. Here, we examine the mechanisms and consequences of thievery in a population of E.ruidum. We show that (1) individuals from nearby colonies were accepted more often than those from farther colonies; (2) rejection rates decreased as individuals interacted more with non-nestmates from the same source colony; and (3) colonies that were experimentally treated to reduce thievery rates had improved productivity. The boost in productivity with thievery reduction was greater in low density populations than in high density populations. We conclude that, as in other species, thievery has negative fitness costs to E.ruidum. However, greater acceptance of neighbors than non-neighbors and increased acceptance after habituation to non-nestmates suggest a proximate explanation for the presence of thievery. Moreover, lower fitness costs of thievery at high nesting density, combined with observations of extraordinarily high densities of E.ruidum throughout its range, suggest there is little selection pressure among these ants to guard against thieves, thus providing an ultimate explanation why thievery persists among litter-foraging ants.

A model was built using attractivity and productivity formulae based upon the flowering periods, the distances to the apiary, and the density and specific nectar productivity of the floral species surrounding the apiary. Honey harvests of 12 apiaries in Wallonie, Belgium (Fig. 1), were recorded from 1998 to 2000. The plant species, location and absolute percentage of cover of nectar-producing (melliferous) plants within a radius of two km of each apiary were surveyed during the summer 2000. These data were encoded and geo-referenced with a Geographical Information System (GIS). This software used tables containing data from field survey and the theoretical melliferous potentials of encountered plants (Tab. I). The model brought out the listing of foraged flowers and their potential honey productivity during flowering periods for each foraging area studied (e.g. Fig. 3). The predictions of honey production (kg/hive/year) were compared to the actual production and the model explained 60% of the variance of the observations (F1,10 = 37.76; P &lt; 0.001; r2 = 0.60; Fig. 2). Some tests of the sensitivity of the results to changing parameters showed the importance of a minimal 2-km radius to model the foraging range (Tab. II). Taking into account landscape diversity, the abundance of areas containing dense melliferous flora was also essential. This work improves our understanding of the melliferous value of the landscape around an apiary. This model represents an interesting tool for beekeepers that would like to evaluate the potential honey production of an area and represents progress in the cartography of regional beekeeping potential. © INRA/DIB-AGIB/ EDP Sciences, 2006.","prediction of the potential honey production at the apiary scale","The objective of this work was to develop a method"

Ascosphaera apis is the causative agent of the chalkbrood disease, a pathology affecting honey bee larvae that significantly harms population growth and colony productivity. In this study, we detected the presence of A. apis in adult worker honey bees by PCR-amplification of the intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS1) of the ribosomal gene (rDNA). We first optimized the DNA extraction by testing different protocols in individual and pooled (colony level) adult honey bee samples. Subsequently, the presence of the fungus A. apis was assessed in both stationary and migratory colonies (subjected to small scale regional level movements) to determine the effect of migratory practices on the dispersal of this pathogen. Results confirmed a higher prevalence of A. apis in migratory apiaries when compared to stationary ones, indicating that migratory colonies are more likely to develop chalkbrood disease.

Despite significant positive correlations between head size and both cutting and harvesting rates, the intensity of lateralization was better explained by cutting and harvesting rates than by head size. Specifically, the most lateralized foragers were the slowest and harvested the smallest leaf area per second.

Moreover, species' responses to land-use change may differ depending on their life history traits such as dispersal ability, trophic level, or sociality. We assessed species richness and life history traits of wild bees in 32 calcareous grasslands in central Germany that differ in size, connectivity, resource availability and landscape context. Declining habitat area and, to a lesser degree, reduced diversity of the surrounding landscape were the key factors negatively influencing species richness. In the community-wide analysis, small body size and solitary reproduction were traits that made species particularly vulnerable to habitat loss. Contrary to our expectations, cleptoparasitic species were not more affected by reduced habitat area and landscape diversity than nest-building species. We performed further detailed trait analyses within the family Halictidae to prevent possible confounding effects due to trait correlations across families. Here, social as opposed to solitary species were more affected by habitat loss. We conclude that the opposite pattern observed for all social bees was mainly caused by large-sized social bumblebee species with high mobility and large foraging distances.

Yet, whether or not pollinators disperse from semi-natural habitat elements into the adjacent agricultural matrix may to a large extent depend on the quality of this matrix and the corresponding pollinator-specific life history traits. To investigate the effects of matrix quality on the distance decay of wild bees and hoverflies, six transects along vegetated field tracks originating at a large semi-natural main habitat and leading into the adjacent agricultural matrix were established in the Wetterau Region, central Hesse, Germany. Species richness of wild bees did not change with distance from the main habitat in landscapes with sufficient grassland cover in the surrounding landscape, but significantly declined when semi-natural grasslands where scarce and isolated in the adjacent agricultural matrix. Abundance of wild bees declined with distance regardless of matrix quality. Species richness of hoverflies did not decline with increasing distance in any landscape. Abundance even increased with distance to the main habitat independently of matrix quality. Thus, our data show that taxa of the pollinator guild may perceive landscapes quite differently. Because of their differing dispersal modes and resource requirements as compared to wild bees, hoverflies may play an important role in maintaining pollination services in agricultural landscapes unsuitable for bee species. Our results highlight the need for considering these taxon-specific differences when predicting the effect of landscape structure on pollinators. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","pollinator dispersal in an agricultural matrix: opposing responses of wild","Semi-natural habitats provide essential resources for pollinators within agricultural landscapes"

Here we report an experiment using the plant Antirrhinum majus and the bumblebee Bombus terrestris to investigate how prior learning experience may affect pollinator preferences between floral types when these are presented together. We trained naive bumblebees to forage freely on flowering individuals of either A. majus pseudomajus (magenta flowers) or A. majus striatum (yellow flowers) in a flight cage. We then used a Y-maze device to expose trained bumblebees to a dual choice between the floral types. We tested the influence of training on their choice, depending on the type of plant signals available (visual signals, olfactory signals, or both). Bumblebees had no innate preference for either subspecies. Bumblebees trained on the yellow-flowered subspecies later preferred the yellow type, even when only visual or only olfactory signals were available, and their preference was not reinforced when both signal types were available. In contrast, bumblebees trained on the magenta-flowered subspecies showed no further preference between floral types and took slightly more time to make their choice. Since pollinator constancy has been observed in wild populations of A. majus with mixed floral types, we suggest that such constancy likely relies on short-term memory rather than acquired preference through long-term memory induced by prior learning. © 2015 Jaworski et al.

To identify spatial and temporal variation in foraging behaviour at the individual level, we studied at two nests the solitary foragers of the Australian jack jumper ant Myrmecia croslandi TAYLOR, 1991. These ants are strictly diurnal and active only between October and April. Foragers of Myrmecia croslandi have a long life span (about a year) and we took advantage of this to determine the variation in their time of activity and foraging paths over a two-year period. By tracking the outbound paths of foraging ants using a Differential GPS we discovered that: (a) individual ants use very different routes to reach the same destination; (b) distance travelled by foragers was longest (up to 15 m) when they travelled to nest-specific eucalypt trees on which they foraged either for prey or tended to sap-sucking insects; (c) and ants made short forays (< 2 m) into non-tree sectors where they exclusively hunted for prey. Individual foragers exhibited temporal fidelity based on their nest departure times, and could be classified as those active (a) all day, (b) only within eight hours after sunrise and (c) only after eight hours after sunrise.

Using search coils with radii of 8.75 and 15.5 mm in a continuous 6-day trial of the prototype device, presence of a 25 mg tag was correctly recorded 126 times, with a single false positive. However, interference between channels prevented more than three channels from being active at once, and temperature dependences of the detectors prevented them from being used outside of a relatively narrow temperature range estimated to be approximately +/-7degreesC about the temperature at which the detectors were tuned. Suggestions were made for improving the stability, sensitivity, and temperature compensation of the detectors for future prototypes. (C) 2003 Silsoe Research Institute.

The conservation of native honey bees, such as the European black bee (Apis mellifera mellifera), therefore, requires large isolated areas to prevent hybridisation with other subspecies, such as A. m. ligustica or A. m. carnica, which may have been introduced by beekeepers. This study used DNA microsatellite markers to determine the mating range of A. m. mellifera in two adjacent semi-isolated valleys (Edale and Hope Valley) in the Peak District National Park, England, in order to assess their suitability for native honey bee conservation and as isolated mating locations. Three apiaries were set up in each valley, each containing 12 colonies headed by a virgin queen and 2 queenright drone producing hives. The virgin queens were allowed to mate naturally with drones from the hives we had set up and with drones from hives owned by local beekeepers. After mating, samples of worker larvae were taken from the 41 queens that mated successfully and genotyped at 11 DNA microsatellite loci. Paternity analyses were then carried out to determine mating distances and isolation. An average of 10.2 fathers were detected among the 16 worker progeny. After correction for non-detection and non-sampling errors, the mean effective mating frequency of the test queens was estimated to be 17.2, which is a normal figure for honey bees. Ninety percent of the matings occurred within a distance of 7.5 km, and fifty percent within 2.5 km. The maximal mating distance recorded was 15 km. Queens and drones did occasionally mate across the borders between the two valleys, showing that the dividing mountain ridge Losehill does not provide complete isolation. Nevertheless, in the most isolated part of Edale sixty percent of all matings were to drones from Edale hives. The large majority of observed mating distances fell within the range of Hope Valley, making this site a suitable location for the long term conservation of a breeding population of black bees. © Springer 2005.","quantifying honey bee mating range and isolation in semi-isolated valleys","Honey bee males and queens mate in mid air and"

This, in turn, could increase fitness by reducing inbreeding depression in progeny and promoting pollen export. The few previous investigations of this hypothesis have all involved bee-pollinated orchids and some have given contradictory results. We studied the effects of adding artificial nectar (sucrose solution) to the spurs of a non-rewarding long-proboscid fly-pollinated orchid, Disa pulchra. Addition of nectar significantly increased the number of flowers probed by flies (2.6-fold), the time spent on a flower (5.4-fold), the number of pollinia removed per inflorescence (4.8-fold) and the proportion of removed pollen involved in self-pollination (3.5-fold). The level of self-pollination increased dramatically with the number of flowers probed by flies. Experimental self-pollination resulted in fruits with only half as many viable seeds as those arising from cross-pollination. Pollinators were more likely to fly long distances (>40 cm) when departing from non-rewarding inflorescences than when departing from rewarding ones.

Bumble bees are one of the most effective pollinators in both natural and cultivated landscapes, but are often the first to be extirpated in human-altered habitats. Yet, little is known about the role of natural and human-altered habitats in promoting or limiting bumble bee gene flow. In this study, I closely examine the genetic structure of the yellow-faced bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, across the southwestern US coast and find strong evidence that natural oceanic barriers, as well as contemporary human-altered habitats, limit bee gene flow. Heterozygosity and allelic richness were lower in island populations, while private allelic richness was higher in island populations compared to mainland populations. Genetic differentiation, measured for three indices across the 1000 km study region, was significantly greater than the null expectation (FST = 0.041, F'ST = 0.044 and Dest = 0.155) and correlated with geographic distance. Furthermore, genetic differentiation patterns were most strongly correlated with contemporary (2011) not past (2006, 2001) resistance maps calibrated for high dispersal limitation over oceans, impervious habitat and croplands. Despite the incorporation of dramatic elevation gradients, the analyses reveal that oceans and contemporary human land use, not mountains, are the primary dispersal barriers for B. vosnesenskii gene flow. These findings reinforce the importance of maintaining corridors of suitable habitat across the distribution range of native pollinators to promote their persistence and safeguard their ability to provide essential pollination services. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","contemporary human-altered landscapes and oceanic barriers reduce bumble bee gene","Much of the world's terrestrial landscapes are being altered by"

We demonstrate extensive crosshabitat gene flow by native bees, with pollination events spanning more than 1,800 m. Pollen was carried twice as far within shade coffee habitat as in nearby forest, and trees growing within shade coffee farms received pollen from a far greater number of sires than trees within remnant forest.

Specifically, little is known about the collection of pollen, an essential component of larval and adult bee food, and whether pollen collection patterns change across habitats, spatial scales, and/or native and non-native floral resource distributions. In this study, the pollen collection patterns and preferences of the yellow-faced bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, were examined across a gradient of natural and human-altered sites. Three hypotheses were investigated: (i) landscape-scale (2km) but not local-scale (250m) floral and habitat composition factors are most predictive of bee-collected pollen composition; (ii) collection of native pollen is greater in sites with greater proportions of natural habitat at landscape scales; and (iii) bees exhibit greater 'preference' for native versus non-native pollen. Bombus vosnesenskii collected more species of pollen when landscape-scale riparian forest cover was low but local- and landscape-scale floral species richness was high. Also, B.vosnesenskii collected pollen from a wide range of plant families and did not exhibit a significant preference for native versus non-native species. Finally, preference analysis indicated that the only significant preference exhibited by B.vosnesenskii during the study period was for Heteromeles arbutifolia, a native shrub.

However, city planners often lack knowledge to identify how well different parts of the green infrastructure are connected, and tools to estimate the accessibility to important habitats for different species in urban areas are strongly needed. We compared the ability of three measures of available food resources, with increasing complexity, for explaining species richness and abundance of bees and wasps at 23 locations in an urban landscape in Sweden. Specifically, we tested (1) the summed amount of food habitat within a buffer circle, (2) the amount of food habitat weighted by distance, and (3) the summed amount of food habitat within an area created by cost-weighted distance based on the surrounding landscape friction. We tested two spatial scales (200 and 400 m). The results show that both the summed (1) and the weighted measures (2) were very poor in explaining species richness and abundance regardless of spatial scale, while we found significant relationships for both species richness and abundance with the friction-based measure (3) at both scales. For the friction-based measure, the relationships with both response variables were strongest at the smallest spatial scale (200 m). We conclude that bees and wasps are sensitive to barriers such as large roads and built-up areas when foraging in urban environments. This is important to consider when assessing the functionality of urban green infrastructure in order to not overestimate the available amount of habitat and how well different parts of the landscape are connected for these important pollinators. © 2018 The Authors.","estimates of accessible food resources for pollinators in urban landscapes","Maintaining biodiversity in urban landscapes requires a well-functioning green infrastructure"

In this research, we examine the separate and combined effects of wing area and wing area asymmetry on maximum load-lifting capability in bumble bees Bombus impatiens Cresson, 1863. Individual bees with experimentally induced forewing wear (0%-24% forewing area loss, 0%-38% forewing area asymmetry) were harnessed with a string to which small bead groups were attached and tested in a flight chamber to measure the maximum weight that they could lift incrementally. Wing wear significantly decreased load-lifting ability: the higher the mean wing area loss, the less mass a bee could lift (2.66 mg load reduction per 1% forewing area loss, which represents ~1.6% of mean body mass or ~5.2% of expected mean nectar load). However, wing area asymmetry, both alone and in combination with area loss, had no detectable effect on maximum lift. The clear cost of wing wear for bumble bees is a linear reduction in weight-lifting capability through loss of wing area. This relatively strong diminution of load lifting by wing wear, observed over the range of wing area losses naturally accrued by wild bees, provides a potential mechanism for declining foraging ability and survivorship of worker bees with wing wear. What remains to be explained is the utter insensitivity of maximum load lifted to forewing asymmetry.","wing wear, but not asymmetry in wear, affects load-lifting capability","Wing wear is widespread in flying insects, but its effects"

Similar to individual immune defenses, social immunity, that is antiparasite defenses mounted for the benefit of individuals other than the actor, is predicted to be altered in social groups. The eusocial honey bee (Apis mellifera) secretes glucose oxidase (GOX), an antiseptic enzyme, throughout its colony, thereby providing immune protection to other individuals in the hive. We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the effects of group density on social immunity, specifically GOX activity, body mass and feeding behavior in caged honey bees. Individual honeybees caged in a low group density displayed increased GOX activity relative to those kept at a high group density. In addition, we provided evidence for a trade-off between GOX activity and body mass: Individuals caged in the low group density had a lower body mass, despite consuming more food overall. Our results provide the first experimental evidence that group density affects a social immune response in a eusocial insect. Moreover, we showed that the previously reported trade-off between immunity and body mass extends to social immunity. GOX production appears to be costly for individuals, and potentially the colony, given that low body mass is correlated with small foraging ranges in bees. At high group densities, individuals can invest less in social immunity than at low densities, while presumably gaining shared protection from infection. Thus, there is evidence that trade-offs at the individual level (GOX vs. body mass) can affect colony-level fitness. © 2018 The Authors.

These changes are rapidly induced by pollination, but will also occur much more slowly without pollination. Orange flowers typically lack nectar and pollen. We examined the reproductive success of these plants to test the hypothesis that retention of orange flowers increases pollinator visitation rate and fruit set while reducing costs to the pollinators. All of the common species of bee pollinators that visited deer weed easily distinguished between yellow and orange flowers at close range and preferentially probed yellow flowers. Retention of orange flowers by these plants resulted in a higher frequency of pollinator visits and a higher fruit set per flower than plants that lacked orange flowers. The number of flowers visited by each pollinator was lower on plants with a mixture of yellow and orange flowers, suggesting that the presence of orange flowers may reduce selfing.

Consequently, pollinators are more likely to encounter predators when visiting the most rewarding flowers. I present a model of how different pollinator species can maximize lifetime resource gains depending on the density and distribution of predators, as well as their vulnerability to capture by predators. For pollinator species that are difficult for predators to capture, the optimal strategy is to visit the most rewarding flowers as long as predator density is low. At higher predator densities and for pollinators that are more vulnerable to predator capture, the lifetime resource gain from the most rewarding flowers declines and the optimal strategy depends on the predator distribution. In some cases, a wide range of floral rewards provides near-maximum lifetime resource gains, which may favor generalization if searching for flowers is costly. In other cases, a low flower reward level provides the maximum lifetime resource gain and so pollinators should specialize on less rewarding flowers. Thus, the model suggests that predators can have qualitatively different top-down effects on plant reproductive success depending on the pollinator species, the density of predators, and the distribution of predators across flower reward levels.","optimal foraging when predation risk increases with patch resources: an","Pollinators and their predators share innate and learned preferences for"

In previous work, we developed an assured fitness returns 'brood-fostering model' that predicts that in cooler environments mothers in multiple-female colonies will have a selective advantage over solitary female nests. According to the model, at cool sites the rate of juvenile maturation is slowed, increasing the probability that the mother will die before the brood reaches independence. In her absence, other females would foster her brood. We tested this hypothesis by manipulating colony size and by monitoring the reproductive success of naturally occurring solitary and multifemale colonies in cold and warm temperature environments. Our results indicate that while multiple-female colonies have higher fitness at cool sites, the solitary female nests achieve higher fitness at warmer sites. The higher reproductive success of multifemale colonies at cold sites further reflects the total failure of solitary female nests at these sites. Solitary female nests that survived generally had higher reproductive success than multifemale colonies at all temperatures. In natural colonies, fitness was highest for smaller multifemale colonies in the colder environments and decreased in the larger colonies.

One potential method of mitigating these effects is creating flower strips. Most previous studies have shown higher pollinator abundances in flower strips, but none have been able to demonstrate increased pollinator abundances at larger spatial scales, in the surrounding agricultural landscapes. We assessed local and landscape-wide effects of flower strips on pollinator abundances, using 18 carefully selected study landscapes in southern Sweden, distributed along independent gradients of landscape heterogeneity and farming intensity. We found that flower strips were more attractive than field borders in general to bumblebees, whereas hoverflies were only attracted to flower strips from nearby field borders. Solitary bees declined with increasing distance from flower strips, but only in complex landscapes. As one of the first studies investigating effects of flower strips on pollinators across the wider landscape, we found increased abundance of bumblebees, but not solitary bees, in field borders outside the flower strips in floristically enhanced landscapes as compared with control landscapes. However, we found that higher quality and/or larger total area of flower strips within a farm was important for both bumblebees and solitary bees. Hoverfly abundance was enhanced on farms with flower strips in simple landscapes. Our results demonstrate that flower strips with rewarding plants do not only attract pollinators locally, but in addition have the potential to increase pollinator abundances across entire landscapes, and particularly in landscapes dominated by farmland.

In this context, we examined the effect of heterogeneous landscapes surrounding and including commercial apple orchards on pollinator visitation and foraging distance during bloom period from 2011 to 2013 in Pennsylvania. Our results showed that the frequency of feral honeybees and solitary bee visits within an apple orchard depends on the proximity of the orchard to an unmanaged habitat (primarily comprised of forest). At the landscape scale, we found that the Mean Proximity Index, the Largest Patch Index, and the Number of Patches positively correlated with the visitation rate of dominant bee taxa (Apis mellifera, Bombus spp., and solitary bees) visiting apple flowers at low spatial scales (up to 500 m around the orchards). The Mean Proximity Index at 500 m was related to bee visitation patterns, especially for solitary bees and A. mellifera. Bees in all our study sites preferred to forage in areas with large homogenous patches up to 500 m around an apple orchard. This effect can be attributed to the mass flowering of apples that formed the largest proportion of the 500 m spatial scale. The Number of Patches at 250 m spatial scale was positively correlated with bee visitation, especially Bombus spp., probably because these areas had more habitats and more resources required by these bees. We conclude that retaining unmanaged habitats closer to commercial apple orchards will maintain biodiversity within the landscapes and insure pollination services to apples. © 2016 Joshi, Otieno, Rajotte, Fleischer and Biddinger.","proximity to woodland and landscape structure drives pollinator visitation in","Landscapes of farms and adjacent areas are known to influence"

Initial observations showed that not all of the bees that appear to be dance followers behave the same. Some bees maneuver themselves behind the dancer, while others do not. The paths of a single dancer, trained to an artificial food source, and her followers were traced during the waggle runs. The success of these dance followers was compared to their position relative to the dancer.

Predictions based on maximisation of rate of energy gain, defined as net energy gained per unit time foraging, are significantly different from observed behaviour (Schmid-Hempel et al. 1985). In this paper we consider the effect of varying travel times in addition to flow rate. The predictions of an extended version of our theoretical model are confronted with experimental results obtained by Núñez (1982). Núñez found that bees filled their crops more fully for higher flows and longer travel times. We show that when the cost of carrying a load is considered, this trend can be predicted by maximising either energetic efficiency or net rate of gain. Figure 1 shows, however, that maximisation of net rate of gain can only produce an acceptable quantitative fit if unreasonably high costs are assumed to result from carrying the load. Energetic efficiency instead generates a good quantitative fit for acceptable assumptions about this cost (Fig. 2). © 1986 Springer-Verlag.","central-place foraging in honey bees: the effect of travel time","Crop-filling by honeybees foraging at sources of variable nectar flow"
"3381","Kacelnik, A; Bateson, M","risky theories - the effects of variance on foraging decisions",1996,"AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST","","This paper concerns the response of foraging animals to variability in rate of gain, or risk. Both the empirical and theoretical literatures relevant to this issue are reviewed. The methodology and results from fifty-nine studies in which animals are required to choose between foraging options differing in the variances in the rate of gain available are tabulated, We found that when risk is generated by variability in the amount of reward, animals are most frequently risk-averse and sometimes indifferent to risk, although in some studies preference depends on energy budget. In contrast, when variability is in delay to reward, animals are universally risk-prone. A range of functional, descriptive and mechanistic accounts for these findings is described, none of which alone is capable of accommodating all aspects of the data. Risk-sensitive foraging theory provides the only currently available explanation for why energy budget should affect preference. An information-processing model that incorporates Weber's law provides the only general explanation for why animals should be risk-averse with variability in amount and risk-prone with delay. A theory based on the mechanisms of associative learning explains quantitative aspects of risk-proneness for delay; specifically why the delay between choice and reward should have a stronger impact on preference than delays between the reward and subsequent choice. It also explains why animals should appear to commit the ''fallacy of the average,'' maximising the expected ratio of amount of reward over delay to reward when computing rates rather than the ratio of expected amount over expected delay. We conclude that only a fusion of functional and mechanistic thinking will lead to progress in the understanding of animal decision making.","risky theories - the effects of variance on foraging decisions","This paper concerns the response of foraging animals to variability"

Measurements of nectar accumulation in experimentally emptied flowers indicated that this time interval is an accurate predictor of nectar volumes in flowers. We found that nectar rewards influence the probability of departure from individual plants, as well as distances of movements within plants. The probability of departure from individual plants was negatively related to the amount of reward received at the two lastvisited flowers. This result indicates that the bees used a probabllistic departure rule, rather than a simple threshold departure rule, and that rewards from both the current and the previously visited flower were important in determining departure points. Distances of inter-flower movements within plants were negatively related to the amount of reward received at the current flower.

It has been hypothesized that sun-basking behaviour may contribute to nest heating because of both heat carriage into the nest by sun-basking workers, and catabolic heat production from the mobilization of the workers' lipid reserves. We investigated sun-basking behaviour in laboratory colonies of F. polyctena exposed to an artificial heat source. Observations on identified individuals revealed that not all ants bask in the sun. Sun-basking and non-sun-basking workers did not differ in body size nor in respiration rates. The number of sun-basking ants and the number of their visits to the hot spot depended on the temperature of both the air and the hot spot. To investigate whether sun basking leads to a physiological activation linked with increased lipolysis, we measured respiration rates of individual workers as a function of temperature, and compared respiration rates of sun-basking workers before and two days after they were allowed to expose themselves to a heat source over 10 days, at self-determined intervals. As expected for ectothermic animals, respiration rates increased with increasing temperatures in the range 5 to 35 degrees C. However, the respiration rates of sun-basking workers measured two days after a long-term exposure to the heat source were similar to those before sun basking, providing no evidence for a sustained increase of the basal metabolic rates after prolonged sun basking. Based on our measurements, we argue that self-heating of the nest mound in early spring has therefore to rely on alternative heat sources, and speculate that physical transport of heat in the ant bodies may have a significant effect.","sun basking in red wood ants formica polyctena (hymenoptera, formicidae):","In early spring, red wood ants Formica polyctena are often"

Most resting wasps were ectothermic or only slightly endothermic (thoracic temperature excess against abdomen < 0.6 degrees C). In the investigated temperature range (T-a = 2.9-42.4 degrees C) mean CO2 production rate of resting wasps increased steeply according to an exponential function, from 5.658 mu l g(-1) min(-1) at 8.3 degrees C to 8.504 mu l g(-1) min(-1) at 20.2 degrees C, 58.686 mu l g(-1) min(-1) at 35.3 degrees C and 102.84 mu l g(-1) min(-1) at 40 degrees C.

The respiratory CTmax did not differ significantly from the activity CTmax of 44.9 degrees C. CTmax values were considerably below that of honeybees (48.9 and 49.0 degrees C for respiration and activity, respectively). This allows honeybees to kill wasps by heat-balling.

Yet when plants and pollinators co-evolve, it is not clear if this will also result in frequent cospeciation. Here, we investigate the mutual evolutionary history of South African oil-collecting Rediviva bees and their Diascia host plants, in which the elongated forelegs of female Rediviva have been suggested to coevolve with the oil-producing spurs of their Diascia hosts. After controlling for phylogenetic nonindependence, we found Rediviva foreleg length to be significantly correlated with Diascia spur length, suggestive of co-evolution. However, as trait correlation could also be due to pollinator shifts, we tested if cospeciation or pollinator shifts have dominated the evolution of Rediviva–Diascia interactions by analysing phylogenies in a cophylogenetic framework. Distance-based cophylogenetic analyses (PARAFIT, PACo) indicated significant congruence of the two phylogenies under most conditions. Yet, we found that phylogenetic relatedness was correlated with ecological similarity (the spectrum of partners that each taxon interacted with) only for Diascia but not for Rediviva, suggesting that phylogenetic congruence might be due to phylogenetic tracking by Diascia of Rediviva rather than strict (reciprocal) co-evolution. Furthermore, event-based reconciliation using a parsimony approach (CORE-PA) on average revealed only 11–13 cospeciation events but 58–80 pollinator shifts. Probabilistic cophylogenetic analyses (COALA) supported this trend (8–29 cospeciations vs. 40 pollinator shifts).

Patellapis doleritica is a recently described communally nesting halictid bee of conservation concern because it is rare and endemic to the Succulent Karoo of South Africa. Moreover, its dispersal is considered to be restricted by its specialised nesting requirements and inclement weather conditions during its limited annual flight period, traits which may be common to other bee species of the region. We hypothesised that gene flow in P. doleritica was low, leading to marked genetic differentiation. Using 7 microsatellites, we investigated its mating and population genetic structure in 258 individuals (171 females and 87 males) from 7 populations spanning most of its known range.

However, it is still not adequately understood how the local resource quality and landscape composition influence pollinators, and if and how the effects vary in space and time. We analysed the influence of landscape- (2 km radius) and local scale- (50 m transects) resources on bumblebee species richness and abundance during two years in South-eastern Norway, where agriculture is highly modernised but landscapes still show limited spatial homogenization. Local flower density and species richness were strongly positively associated with bumblebee densities and species richness, but higher landscape-level flower species richness were linked to lower local bumblebee abundances. Early and late mass flowering crops had clear, but contrasting, effects. The total area of early flowering crops had a consistent negative impact on bumblebee density and species richness throughout the season, while late flowering crops had a positive impact in the beginning of the season before their bloom, suggesting a carry-over effect from previous years. The negative effects of early flowering crops could be due to competition of bumblebees with honey-bees, which are widely used in these crops. Bumblebee density and species richness were clearly negatively correlated with the total area of forest and flower-poor land use areas, including grass fields and cereals. In contrast, bumblebees were positively associated with most linear elements in the landscape (especially pasture and cropland verges), except for roads, which negatively affected bumblebee densities, possibly due to increased mortality, since the quality of the flower resources did not differ from other linear elements. Our results show that the quality and the spatial and temporal distribution of flower resources within the landscape are important drivers for bumblebees, but can create counterintuitive distribution patterns depending on the temporal and spatial resolution of the survey. Increasing flower resources in linear elements and the amount of late mass-flowering crops may be viable management measures to improve conditions for bumblebees in moderately intensified landscapes.

Although, as most techniques are based on the image histogram to be segmented, MT approaches only include the occurrence frequency of particular intensity range disregarding each spatial information. Energy curve-based contextual information can help to improve the quality of the thresholded image as it computes not only the value of the pixel but also its vicinity. Therefore, the energy curve is intended to carry spatial information into a curve with the same properties as the histogram. In this paper, classical Otsu’s method (between-class variance) is combined with energy curve for multilevel thresholding to perform segmentation of colored images. The energy curve-based Otsu (Energy-Otsu) uses an exhaustive search process to determine the optimal threshold values. However, due to the multidimensionality and multimodal nature of the color images, it becomes challenging and highly complex to obtain optimal thresholds. Therefore, the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm is coupled with Otsu thresholding criteria to perform MT over the energy curve. The proposed Energy-Otsu-CS method produces better-segmented results as compared to other well-known optimization algorithms such as differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, firefly algorithm, bacterial foraging optimization, and artificial bee colony algorithm.

Indirect estimates of the number of migrants per generation (Nm = 3.00, calculated from GST; Nm=3.57, calculated from the frequency of nine alleles unique to single populations) indicate that gene flow has been extensive in H. hakuunensis.

In social insects, reproductive success and survival of the colony critically depend on the colony's ability to efficiently allocate workers to the various tasks which need to be performed. In bumblebees, workers show a large variation of body size within a colony. Large workers tend to leave the nest and forage for nectar and pollen, whereas small workers stay inside the nest and fulfill nest duties. It was speculated that size-related differences of the sensory system might contribute to alloethism found in bumblebee colonies. 2. In the first part, we investigated how body size determines eye morphology. We measured several eye parameters of Bombus terrestris workers and drones. In both, workers and drones, larger individuals had larger eyes with larger facet diameters, more ommatidia and larger ocelli. At similar body size, drones exhibited larger eyes and ocelli compared to workers. Due to theoretical considerations, we predict that large individuals with large eyes should be better able to operate in illumination conditions of lower intensity than small individuals, since ommatidial sensitivity is proportional to the square of facet diameter. 3. In the second part, we tested this prediction. In a behavioural experiment, we first caught bumblebees of various sizes in the field and then determined the lowest light intensity level at which they are just able to fly under controlled laboratory conditions. We tested workers of B. terrestris and B. pascuorum, and workers and drones of B. lapidarius. Large bumblebees were able to fly under lower light levels compared to small bees, with light intensity thresholds ranging from 1.1 to 5.5 lux. 4. Our results indicate that the increased light sensitivity of the visual system of large bumblebees allows them to fly under poor light conditions, for example, very early in the morning or late at dusk. This is of potential benefit to the survival of a bumblebee colony since flowers that open early in the morning usually have accumulated a relatively high amount of nectar and pollen throughout the night, and large bumblebees can utilize these resources earlier than most other bees. Thus, our findings have important implications for the understanding of the functional significance and evolution of alloethism in bumblebee colonies.","bigger is better: implications of body size for flight ability","1.

Imidacloprid doses, ranging from 1/5 to 1/50 of the reported LD50, were fed to bees orally. The study consisted of three experimental parts performed sequentially without interruption. In Part 1, both flower colors contained a 4 mu L 1 M sucrose solution reward. Part 2 offered bees 4 mu L of 1.5 M sucrose solution in blue flowers and a 4 mu L 0.5 M sucrose solution reward in white flowers. In Part 3 we reversed the sugar solution rewards, while keeping the flower color consistent. Each experiment began 30 min after administration of the pesticide. We recorded the percentage of experimental bees that returned to forage after treatment. We also recorded the visitation rate, number of flowers visited, and floral reward choices of the bees that foraged after treatment. The forager return rate declined linearly with increasing imidacloprid dose. The number of foraging trips by returning bees was also affected adversely. However, flower fidelity was not affected by imidacloprid dose. Foragers visited both blue and white flowers extensively in Part 1, and showed greater fidelity for the flower color offering the higher sugar solution reward in Parts 2 and 3. Although larger samples sizes are needed, our study suggests that imidacloprid may not affect the ability to select the higher nectar reward when rewards were reversed. We observed acute, mild effects on foraging by honey bees, so mild that storage of imidacloprid tainted-honey is very plausible and likely to be found in honey bee colonies.","sublethal imidacloprid effects on honey bee flower choices when foraging","Neonicotinoids, systemic neuro-active pesticides similar to nicotine, are widely used"

Honey samples (N = 33) were collected from beehives of Estonia during 2013 and 2014, and analysed for residues of 47 currently used agricultural pesticides using the multiresidue method with HPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS and a single residue method for glyphosate, aminopyralid and clopyralid. Residues of eight different active ingredients with representatives from all three basic pesticide classes were determined. Although no correlation was detected between the cumulative amount of pesticide residues and percent of oilseed crops in the foraging territory, most of the residues are those allowed for oilseed rape treatments. Among all pesticides, herbicide residues prevailed in 2013 but not in 2014. Despite the relatively small agricultural impact of Estonia, the detected levels of pesticide residues sometimes exceeded maximum residue level; however, these concentrations do not pose a health risk to consumers, also acute toxicity to honey bees would be very unlikely. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","are pesticide residues in honey related to oilseed rape treatments?","Pesticide treatments before and during the flowering of honey bee"

Maximising individual work effort is limited by the physical constraints on foraging outside the nest. Previous studies of factors influencing activity in social insects suggest that light intensity, ground and air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and/or rainfall may be important. This study aimed to determine which environmental factors influence foraging in an invasive social insect, Vespula germanica, which has been introduced to Australia, where it experiences a hotter and drier climate than in its native range. Activity was measured in terms of foraging traffic, with nests from a range of locations being monitored. Results indicate that the onset of rain reduces activity by approximately 30%, but foraging returns to previous levels immediately after rain stops. Foraging time is correlated with duration of daylight, with wasp daily activity being on average 22 min longer than the time between sunrise and sunset. Low light was found to restrict wasp activity, as were low and high temperatures. A linear mixed-effects model developed to explain the influence of these variables on numbers of foragers was highly significant. Under hot conditions, V. germanica individuals thermoregulate their body temperature by regurgitating water. They also use water in evaporative cooling to keep nests at optimum temperatures. Thus, in this species, hot temperatures increase the need for water, and so populations may be severely impacted in seasonally hot regions where water is limited. © 2008 Birkhaeuser.","environmental factors influencing daily foraging activity of vespula germanica (hymenoptera,","In social insects, workers forego reproduction in favour of foraging"

After training, the bees were exposed to side-light flashes on their homing route in the arena. The flight paths were recorded on video and analyzed frame by frame with reference to the the main parameters, the course angle, the yaw angle and the ground velocity of the bee. The responses to side light flashes were evaluated with respect to 'on' and 'off' and to the level of coupling between the orienting subsystems (course, yawing and speed control). Bees behave differently on feeding and homing flight: it seems that honeybees respond much more by phototaxis and less by pattern-orientation on their homing rout when disturbed by side light flashes. Two categories of responses, early and late light switch reactions, are traced in both ocellar states (fully sighted and ocelli-occluded). They reveal opposite polarities and can be observed in all main parameters investigated in free flight. Usually, the orienting subsystems seem to be more or less coupled. Under arousal by light disturbance, a kind of servo-control of flight direction by the orientation of the body can be postulated. But the subsystems also operate loosely, making a recurrent change of the visual orientation strategies possible. This principle, however, can be modified and even cancelled in ocelli-occluded bees. Observed on the individual level, the orienting systems might behave undamped causing resonance effects and overdriving. Observed on supraindividual level, the orienting subsystems are coupled more strongly in ocelli-occluded bees. This forces them to stick to prefixed programmes more than fully sighted bees. Therefore, light disturbance can push ocelli-occluded bees outside the biologically sensible range more easily than fully sighted bees.","the ocellar control of orienting subsystems in homing honeybees, investigated","Fully sighted honeybees and bees with all ocelli occluded were"

Each colony was selected as reportedly 'aggressive', 'intermediate' or 'docile' and consisted of about 10,000 bees. We applied three stimulation regimes (mechanical disturbance, exposure to alarm pheromones, and the combination of both) and measured their behaviours by tracking the rates of outflying bees at the entrance sites of the test hives. We provided evidence that for mechanical disturbances the test colonies resolved into two response types, if the 'immediate' defence response, assessed in the first minute of stimulation, was taken as a function of foraging: 'releaser' colonies allocated flying guards, 'retreater' colonies reduced the outside-hive activities. This division was observed irrespective of the subspecies membership and maintained in even roughly changing environmental conditions. However, if pheromone and mechanical stimulation were combined, the variety of colony defensiveness restricted to two further types irrespective of the subspecies membership: six of nine colonies degraded their rate of flying defenders with increasing foraging level, three of the colonies extended their 'aggressiveness' by increasing the defender rate with the foraging level. Such 'super-aggressive' colonies obviously are able to allocate two separate recruitment pools for foragers and flying defenders.","aggressive and docile colony defence patterns in apis mellifera. a","Colony defence in Apis mellifera involves a variety of traits"

Male flowers have longer and more frequently white corona scales which may mimic the projecting white styles of female flowers. Male and female flowers were observed to secrete similar quantities of nectar sugar on the first morning of opening, but female flowers secreted more than males subsequently, and the total volumes of nectar secreted by female flowers were considerably greater. Male plants varied more than females in the total quantity of nectar sugar secreted per flower. Nectar concentration was nearly always greater in male flowers than in female flowers. Bumblebees, particularly Bombus hortorum (L.), B. pascuorum (Scop.) and B. terrestris (L.), were the most important visitors to the. flowers of S. dioica in the study sites, with some honeybees [Apis mellifera (L.)], butterflies (mainly Pieridae) and hoverflies (Syrphidae). Some visitors, including those that were most numerous at some sites, made most or all of their visits illegitimately. In the field in 1980 many visitors were observed to discriminate in favour of male flowers, which were much more numerous than female flowers. In the experimental population in 1981, many visitors discriminated in favour of female flowers, which were more numerous than in the field populations but were still substantially outnumbered by male flowers. Some individual bumblebees showed a change in preferences during the day, disciminating in favour of female flowers only during the afternoon, when the nectar resources available from female flowers were proportionately greater. The total numbers of visits that were observed to female and male flowers in the experimental population corresponded closely with the total quantities of nectar sugar available from each sex.

Dispersal pathways between Africa and Australia during that time are problematic, with several studies suggesting dispersals via the now largely submerged Kerguelen and Crozet Plateaus.

The flowers were randomly mixed and all three flower types offered equal nectar volumes. Visited flowers were refilled with probability 0.5. Flight distances, flight durations and nectar probing durations were determined and related to the bees' recent experiences. The naive bees exhibited area-restricted search behavior, i.e., flew shorter distances following visits to rewarding flowers than after visits to empty flowers. Additionally, flight distances during flower-type transitions were longer than flight distances between flowers of the same type. The two movement titles operated together: flight distances were longest for flights between flower types following non-rewarding visits, shortest for within-type flights following rewarding visits. An increase in flight displacement during flower-type shifts was also observed in a second experiment, in which all three types were always rewarding. In this experiment, flower-type shifts were also accompanied by an increase in flight duration.

Therefore, the objective of the study was to develop species-specific allometric equations for O. europaea L. subsp. cuspidata using semi-destructive method and evaluate allometric models for estimating the aboveground biomass (AGB). Results and Discussions: After all the necessary biomass calculations were done, seven AGB equations were developed. These regression equations relate AGB with diameter at breast height (DBH), height (H), and density (rho) individually and in combination. Out of seven, four allometric equations were chosen based on goodness-of-fit statistics and three were rejected. The selected models were tested for accuracy based on observed data. The best models selected have higher R-2-adj and lower residual standard error and Akaike information criterion than rejected equations. The relations for all selected models are significant (p < 0.000), which showed strong correlation of AGB with selected dendrometric variables. Accordingly, the AGB was strongly correlated with DBH and was not significantly correlated with wood density and height individually in O. europaea L. subsp. cuspidata allometric equation development. In combination, AGB was strongly correlated with DBH and height; DBH and wood density; and the combination of DBH, height, and wood density.

These displays sometimes express discrete polymorphisms; however, the adaptive drivers of such variation are not well understood. Here, we explore a previously unknown color polymorphism in the orb-web spider Gasteracantha fornicata. We discovered that in North Queensland, Australia, female spiders exhibit dorsal bands appearing (to the human observer) either white or yellow and characterized by sigmoidal spectral curves centered on approx. 447 and 496nm, respectively. Based on sensory drive theory, we hypothesized that morphs may be alternatively favored by the switch in ambient viewing conditions engendered by sunny vs. cloudy skies. We addressed this hypothesis indirectly by studying morph frequencies across a approx. 200km geographic gradient of solar exposure (a surrogate for cloudiness), and by investigating the phenotypic signature of catch success via a resource stress experiment and in wild spiders. Our data indicate substantial geographic variation in morph frequency, with white morphs dominating at more cloudy northern locations. Rather than a gradual cline, morph frequency inverted mid-way along this range and was closely fit by a logistic relationship with latitude. Experimentally restricted access to larger prey caused spiders to lose more mass than size and to exhibit less bright dorsal markings. Wild-sampled spiders from two localities of divergent morph frequency indicated no differences in residual mass, but intriguingly, the white morph was larger and heavier (than the yellow morph) where it was relatively rare. Our data hint at negative frequency dependence, but remain broadly consistent with a sensory drive explanation based on cloudiness, and we suggest these as worthy avenues for closer investigation.","color polymorphism in spiny spiders (gasteracantha fornicata): testing the adaptive","Many sit-and-wait predators use conspicuous displays of color to attract"

Resultant fragmentation and loss of suitable foraging habitats, combined with pesticide exposure, may increase demands on foraging, specifically the ability to collect or reach sufficient resources under such stress. Understanding effects that pesticides have on flight performance is therefore vital if we are to assess colony success in these changing landscapes. Neonicotinoids are one of the most widely used classes of pesticide across the globe, and exposure to bees has been associated with reduced foraging efficiency and homing ability. One explanation for these effects could be that elements of flight are being affected, but apart from a couple of studies on the honeybee (Apis mellifera), this has scarcely been tested. Here, we used flight mills to investigate how exposure to a field realistic (10 ppb) acute dose of imidacloprid affected flight performance of a wild insect pollinator—the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris audax. Intriguingly, observations showed exposed workers flew at a significantly higher velocity over the first ¾ km of flight. This apparent hyperactivity, however, may have a cost because exposed workers showed reduced flight distance and duration to around a third of what control workers were capable of achieving. Given that bumblebees are central place foragers, impairment to flight endurance could translate to a decline in potential forage area, decreasing the abundance, diversity, and nutritional quality of available food, while potentially diminishing pollination service capabilities. © 2019 The Authors.

We carried out paternity analysis based on six DNA microsatellite markers on a total of 277 mature trees forming four spatially distinct subpopulations in a 70 ha area, and 147 and 188 2-year-old seedlings originating from seeds produced in 1996 and 1998 (cohorts 96 and 98, respectively). Outcrossing rates (0.93 and 0.96 for cohorts 96 and 98, respectively) did not differ between years. Mean dispersal distances (222 and 192 m) were not significantly different between the 2 years but marginally more biased to long distance in 1996. The mean relatedness among cross-pollinated seedlings sharing the same mothers in cohort 96 was lower than that in cohort 98. This can be attributed to the two facts that the proportion of inter-subpopulations pollen flow among cross-pollination events was marginally higher in cohort 96 (44%) than in cohort 98 (33%), and that mature trees within the same subpopulations are genetically more related to each other than those between different subpopulations. We conclude that D. tempehes maintained effective pollen dispersal in terms of outcrossing rate and pollen dispersal distance in spite of the large difference in foraging characteristics between two types of pollinators.

The floral phenology including flowering synchrony in the populations, anthesis, anther dehiscence, stigma receptivity, pollinators visitation frequency, and mating system including index of self-incompatibility were worked out in Schima wallichii according to the ear-marked standard methods given by various scientists for each parameter. Results. The flowering period in Schima wallichii varied from 33 to 42 days with mean synchrony of 0.54 to 0.68 between the populations. The stigma was receptive up to 2.5 days only and showed slightly protandrous type of dichogamy. Average pollen production ranged between 6.90 × 107 pollen per tree in 2007 and 15.49 × 108 pollen per tree in 2011. A three-year masting cycle was noticed in this species. The frequency of visitation of honey bees was fairly high (5.2 ± 1.12 visits/flower/hour) as compared to other pollinators. The hand pollination revealed maximum fruit (74.2 ± 5.72%) and seed (70.8 ± 7.46%) settings. Conclusions. The variation in flowering phenology and pollen yield individually and annually along with temporal separation in anther dehiscence and pollinator's visitation cause pollen limited reproduction, which ultimately influences the reproductive success in Schima wallichii. © 2013 Vinod Prasad Khanduri et al.","annual variation in flowering phenology, pollination, mating system, and pollen","Background.

Honey bees use visual attributes of the targeted food source, such as its color, shape, size, direction and distance from the hive, and the landmarks around it to navigate during foraging. They transmit the location information of the food source to other bees if it is highly rewarding. To investigate the relative importance of these attributes, we trained bees to feeders in two different experiments. In the first experiment, we asked whether bees prefer to land on (a) a similar feeder at a different distance on the same heading or on (b) a visually distinct feeder located at the exact same location. We found that, within a short foraging range, bees relied heavily on the color and the shape of the food source and to a lesser extent on its distance from the hive. In the second experiment, we asked if moving the main landmark or the feeder (visual target) influenced recruitment dancing for the feeder. We found that foragers took longer to land and danced fewer circuits when the location of the food source, or a major landmark associated with it, changed. These results demonstrate that prominent visual attributes of food sources and landmarks are evidently more reliable than distance information and that foraging bees heavily utilize these visual cues at the later stages of their journey. © 2018 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","influence of visual targets and landmarks on honey bee foraging","Animals use diverse sensory stimuli to navigate their environment and"

The daily courses of these two components are strongly correlated with each other, and also correlated with the daily variation in misdirection (""Mißweisung"") in the bees' dances, and thus with the periodic variations of the intensity of the earth's magnetic field (Figs. 3 to 5). Thus, the variations in the sounds produced represent at the same time the daily course of misdirection. Although individual bees produce sounds of different basic pitches (Basistonlagen) - with maximum wavelengths of the two components mentioned - the absolute range of change is about the same for all dancing bees (single pulses: 0.3 ms/10° misdirection, sequences of vibrational pulses: 2.0 ms/10° misdirection). Amplification of natural field strength by a factor of about 3 to 5 does not abolish the strong correlations existing between the two sound components and misdirection; the range of changing, on the contrary, increases with the amplification of field strength (Figs. 6 and 7). Under conditions that eliminate misdirection, e. g. compensation for the magnetic field (Figs. 8 and 9) or dancing on a horizontal comb - regardless of whether the observations are done under natural field strength (Fig. 10) or following artificial amplification of field intensity (Fig. 11) - the dancing bees produce their basic pitches throughout the day. On the vertical comb, the same phenomenon is noticed at the socalled zeropoints, under conditions of both normal and increased field strength. If bees are foraging far away from their hive, the sounds they produced when they return always start from their individual basic pitches and adapt, within a few minutes, to the wavelengths characteristic of the prevailing situation as regards field strength and dancing angle (Fig. 12). In general, the organization of the sounds essentially confirms former results, although their mean frequency range is somewhat higher (278 Hz for the single pulse and 33 Hz for the sequence of vibrational pulses resp.). A peculiar feature of the dance of only two bees is described, the so-called ""continuous sound"". These two bees produced sounds both during the tail-wagging run and the return half cycle.

Further, more abundant and diverse communities of bees were found nesting at farms with patches of natural habitat near by than farms that were far away from natural habitat. Species responded differently to soil conditions created by farming practices, but the variability in nesting bee abundance was lower in farms near natural habitat than farms far from natural habitat.

However, mouse sperm lacking PH-20 were still capable of penetrating the cumulus mass despite a delayed dispersal of cumulus cells. Intriguingly, a 55-kDa hyaluronan-hydrolyzing protein was abundantly present in wild-type and PH-20-deficient mouse sperm. In this study, we purified the 55-kDa mouse protein from soluble protein extracts released from epididymal sperm by acrosome reaction and identified as a hyaluronidase, HyaI5. HyaI5 was exclusively expressed in the testis and formed a 160-kbp gene cluster together with HyaIp1, HyaI4, and Ph-20 on mouse chromosome 6. HyaI5 was a single-chain hyaluronidase present on the plasma and acrosomal membranes of sperm presumably as a GPI-anchored protein. Moreover, hyaluronan zymography revealed that HyaI5 is enzymatically active in the pH range 5-7 and inactive at pH 3 and 4. Both HyaI5-enriched PH-20-free soluble protein extracts and PH-20-deficient mouse sperm were capable of dispersing cumulus cells from the cumulus mass. Cumulus cell dispersal was strongly inhibited by the presence of a hyaluronidase inhibitor, apigenin. These results suggest that in the mouse, HyaI5 may function principally as a ""cumulus matrix depolymerase"" in the sperm penetration through the cumulus mass and in the local hyaluronan hydrolysis near or on the surface of the egg zona pellucida to enable the proximal region of sperm tail to move freely.

Although entomologists have used direct observation and mark-and-recapture techniques as tracking methods, there are drawbacks such as low recapture rates in the case of marking techniques. The objective of this study was to quantitatively examine adhesive bond strength between radar tag and insect body and to evaluate the effect of tag attachment on flight behavior and capacity of five economically important insect species, including three pest species, Riptortus pedestris (Hemiptera: Alydidae), Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae), and Ricania sp. (Hemiptera: Ricaniidae) and two pollinators, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae). The adhesive bond strength was substantially different among these five insect species, but the strength was sufficiently strong for operational use in harmonic radar tagging except in Ricania sp. Bond strength on B. terrestris was 817 +/- 43.65 g-forces, which was the strongest among the five species tested, while that on Ricania sp. was 1.7 +/- 0.20 g-forces, which was the weakest. For all insects, no significant correlation between bond strength and insect body size was observed. The radar tag attachment affected the flight behavior and capacity of five insect species in different ways. The radar tag attachment did not significantly affect the propensity of R. pedestris, L. delicatula, or B. terrestris to takeoff compared to untagged individuals. However, the takeoff propensities of A. mellifera and Ricania sp. were negatively affected by the radar tag attachment. Flight capacities of R. pedestris, A. mellifera, and B. terrestris were not affected by the tag attachment compared to untagged individuals, but the flight capacity of Ricania sp. was negatively affected by the tag attachment. The results of this study indicate that the radar technique has promising potential for R. pedestris, L delicatula, and B. terrestris. However, this technique may have limited potential for A. mellifera and Ricania sp. because the radar tag can significantly affect their flight behavior.

In mammals, by contrast, this process can take place through purely idiothetic (mainly proprioceptive and vestibular) signals. However, without any stable external reference for measuring direction, path integration is highly affected by cumulative errors and thus has been considered so far as valid only for short-distance navigation. Here we show through two path integration experiments (homing and shortcut finding) that the blind mole rat assesses direction both through internal signals and by estimating its heading in relation to the earth's magnetic field. Further, it is shown that the greater the circumvolution and length of the traveled path, the more the animal relies on the geomagnetic field. This path integration system strongly reduces the accumulation of errors due to inaccuracies in the estimation of rotations and thus allows the mole rat to navigate efficiently in darkness, without the help of any landmark, over both short and long distances.","a subterranean mammal uses the magnetic compass for path integration","Path integration allows animals to navigate without landmarks by continuously"

Each pasture was exposed to one of four cattle stocking rates for two years and grazing intensity was quantified by measuring utilization. We measured soil and vegetation characteristics related to floral and nesting resources as well as several metrics of the bee community. Increased grazing intensity significantly reduced vegetation structure, soil stability, and herbaceous litter and significantly increased soil compaction and bare ground. Native bees responded with changes in abundance, richness, diversity, and community composition. Responses varied with taxa and time of season. Bumble bees were sensitive to grazing intensity early in the season, showing reduced abundance, diversity, and/or richness with increased intensity, potentially because of altered foraging behavior.

It was found that although visitor profiles were sometimes consistent with classic pollination syndromes, these syndromes were unreliable predictors of floral visitors. Very few flowers were exclusively bird-pollinated, and none were strictly fly-, beetle-, wasp-, or butterfly-pollinated. The majority of flowering plants were unspecialized in their morphology, and consequently hosted a diverse array of visitors. In addition, visitor profiles to congeners with similar floral morphologies, and even to conspecifics, differed between habitats. Altitude was a major factor in determining visitors, with flies being the most abundant visitors above 700 m. However, congeners in several genera of Epacridaceae, as well as the genus Correa, which differed in floral morphology also differed in visitor profiles. Tubular flowers were associated with birds, while flowers with more accessible nectar were visited by insects. The only taxa exhibiting a bee-pollination syndrome that were largely visited by bees were the Fabaceae and Goodenia ovata Sm. Several species with purple or pink flowers were also predominantly visited by bees, but did not strictly conform to the melittophilous syndrome. In contrast, other flowers exhibiting an ostensibly mellitophilous syndrome hosted very few bees.

Bumble bees occupy a wide range of habitats from the Nearctic to the Tropics in which they play an important role as pollinators. However, little is known about how a bumble bee colony regulates pollen collection. We manipulated protein quality and colony pollen stores in lab-reared colonies of the native North American bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. We debut evidence that bumble bee colony foraging levels and pollen storage behavior are tuned to the protein quality (range tested: 17-30% protein by dry mass) of pollen collected by foragers and to the amount of stored pollen inside the colony. Pollen foraging levels (number of bees exiting the nest) significantly increased by 55%, and the frequency with which foragers stored pollen in pots significantly increased by 233% for pollen with higher compared to lower protein quality. The number of foragers exiting the nest significantly decreased (by 28%) when we added one pollen load equivalent each 5 min to already high intranidal pollen stores. In addition, pollen odor pumped into the nest is sufficient to increase the number of exiting foragers by 27%. Foragers directly inspected pollen pots at a constant rate over 24 h, presumably to assess pollen levels. Thus, pollen stores can act as an information center regulating colony-level foraging according to pollen protein quality and colony need. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","manuscript in preparation for behavioral ecology and sociobiology bumble bee","The regulation of protein collection through pollen foraging plays an"

We previously used a novel immediate early gene, termed kakusei, to demonstrate that the neural activity of a specific mushroom body (MB) neuron subtype is preferentially enhanced in the forager brain. The sensory information related to this MB neuron activity, however, remained unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we used kakusei to analyze the relationship between MB neuron activity and types of foraging behavior. The number of kakusei-positive MB neurons was higher in the round dancers that had flown a short distance than in the waggle dancers that had flown a long distance. Furthermore, the amount of kakusei transcript in the MBs inversely related to the waggle-phase duration of the waggle dance, which correlates with the flight distance. Using a narrow tunnel whose inside was vertically or axially lined, we manipulated the pattern of visual input, which is received by the foragers during flight, and analysed kakusei expression. The amount of kakusei transcript in the MBs was related to the foraging frequency but not to the tunnel pattern. In contrast, the number of kakusei-positive MB neurons was affected by the tunnel patterns, but not related to foraging frequency. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that the MB neuron activity depends on the foraging frequency, whereas the number of active MB neurons is related to the pattern of visual input received during foraging flight. Our results suggest that the foraging frequency and visual experience during foraging are associated with different MB neural activities.","dance type and flight parameters are associated with different mushroom","Background: Honeybee foragers can transmit the information concerning the location"

When species have become rare such studies are complicated because particular behavior or life history traits may be the cause but also the result of the decline of a species. We approached this problem by studying species' characteristics on specimens that were collected before the onset of their decline and preserved in natural history museums. In northwestern Europe, some bumble bee species declined dramatically during the 20th century whereas other, ecologically similar, species maintained stable populations. A long-standing debate focuses on whether this is caused by declining species having stricter host plant preferences. We compared the composition of pollen loads of five bumble bee species with stable populations and five with declining populations using museum specimens collected before 1950 in Belgium, England, and The Netherlands. Prior to 1950, the number of plant taxa in pollen loads of declining species was almost one-third lower than that in stable species even though individuals of stable and declining species generally originated from the same areas. There were no systematic differences in the composition of pollen loads between stable and declining species, but the plant taxa preferred by declining species before 1950 had experienced a stronger decline in the 20th century than those preferred by stable species. In 2004 and 2005, we surveyed the areas where bumble bees had been caught in the past and compared the composition of past and present pollen loads of the stable, but not of the by now locally extinct declining species. The number of collected pollen taxa was similar, but the composition differed significantly between the two periods. Differences in composition reflected the major changes in land use in northwestern Europe but also the spread of the invasive plant species Impatiens glandulifera. The main question now is why declining species apparently were not able to switch to less preferred food plants when stable species were. This study shows that natural history collections can play an important role in improving our understanding of the ecological mechanisms driving species population change. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","a retrospective analysis of pollen host plant use by stable","Understanding population declines has been the objective of a wide"

Declining pollinator populations have caused concern about consequences for food production, and have initiated an increasing number of initiatives that aim to mitigate pollinator loss through enhancement of floral resources. Studies evaluating effects of mitigation measures generally demonstrate positive responses of pollinators to floral resource enhancement. However, it remains unclear whether this represents landscape-level population effects or results from a spatial redistribution of individuals from otherwise unaffected populations. 2. Here, we present a method for estimating landscape-level population effects using data from commonly used standardized pollinator transect surveys. The approach links local density responses of pollinators in both mitigation sites and surrounding landscape elements to the area these habitats occupy in mitigation landscapes as well as control landscapes to obtain landscape-level population estimates. 3. We demonstrate the method using data from a 2-year study examining the effects of experimental wildflower enhancements on wild bumblebees and solitary bees in Dutch agricultural landscapes. The results show that conclusions based on local responses may differ significantly from those based on landscape-level responses. 4. Wildflower enhancements significantly enhanced landscape-level abundance of both bumblebees and solitary bees. Bumblebees showed a pronounced positive local density response in mitigation sites and the surrounding landscape that was in line with significant landscape-level increases in abundance. However, solitary bees showed no local response to mitigation sites, and the landscape-level increases in abundance only became apparent when the area of bee habitat was taken into account. 5. Incorporating the area of both newly created and pre-existing pollinator habitats into effect estimates accounts for density-dependent processes such as dilution, spillover and local concentration of individuals. It, therefore, results in more reliable estimates of the response to mitigation measures of pollinators, as well as other mobile arthropod groups that are often being surveyed using transect surveys.","scaling up effects of measures mitigating pollinator loss from local-","1.

Most animals have to bridge some distances in space and time to provide all resources necessary for survival. Little is known about how the local and regional management of tropical agroforestry systems, differing in the availability of food resources and suitable nesting sites, determine foraging trip duration and density of bees and wasps (Hymenoptera Aculeata). 2. In this study, foraging trip duration and brood-cell density (in trap nests exposed for a 15-month period) were analysed for three species, which represent three guilds in 24 agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia): the pollinator Heriades sp. aff fulvescens (Apidae), the cacao caterpillar-hunting predator Rhynchium haemorrhoidale umeroatrum (Eumenidae) and the spider-hunting predator Auplopus levicarinatus (Pompilidae). The agroforestry systems were characterized by plant species richness, blossom cover of herbs, light intensity and distance from the nearest natural forest. 3. The correlation of foraging time to bee and wasp density showed the relative importance of food and nest-site availability for the pollinator and the spider-hunting predator, because both parameters are correlated with light intensity in the agroforestry systems. In contrast, foraging time and nest density of the eumenid predator were not correlated because of the distance between high quantities of food resources (in sites with dense cacao plants) and nesting sites (in adjacent natural forests). 4. The eumenid response to local and regional agroforestry management illustrates that species may survive only in landscapes that permit access to a multiple set of resources. Accordingly, habitat evaluations using only foraging time may lead to wrong conclusions, as key drivers of population dynamics may not be inside but outside the local systems, emphasizing the need for a landscape approach.","foraging trip duration and density of megachilid bees, eumenid wasps","1.

Post Pleistocene movements of most plants and animals into the region have generally followed East and North Greenland coastal routes, and the majority of the plants have North American affinities. Climatic change, bringing about reduction in the extent of sea ice adjacent to the coast and changes in seasonality and associated precipitation and air movements, influences patterns of activity, growth, reproduction, and dispersal of all life forms present. Climate-associated changes in the biotic communities of the region are altering inter-species interactions, notably pollination, seed dispersal and plant-herbivore relations. Sexual reproduction and dispersal of propagules, primarily seeds, are essential processes underlying maintenance of genetic diversity in plant communities in Northeast Greenland. Wind and water transport of seeds are primary methods by which plants disperse and become established in the High Arctic, particularly at shorter distances. Birds and mammals are also involved and may be of particular significance to long-distance seed dispersal. In Northeast Greenland, dispersal of viable seeds may frequently occur by passage through the guts of geese and musk oxen. Research at Zackenberg on the role of insects in pollination of flowering plants has shown that Diptera species, primarily flies, dominate among the insect species visiting flowers each summer. Diptera, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Hymenoptera (bumble bees and small wasps), and one Hemiptera (true bugs) species have constituted the primary pollinators at Zackenberg. Arctic willow Salix arctica, white arctic bell heather Cassiope tetragona, and mountain avens Dryas octopetala are the primary species represented in the pollen present on pollinating insects at Zackenberg. The effects of climate warming that may enhance environmental conditions for plant growth in Northeast Greenland and accelerate invasion of new species will also be tied to the relationship of specific plant species to their insect pollinators. Those plants that are self-pollinated may have an initial advantage in an environment where insects and their plant relationships are being altered by the changing climate. An increase in growth and dispersal of shrubs in the Arctic is occurring as a consequence of climate warming. Increases in shrubs with more upright growth form, especially willows, will generate microhabitats not previously present in the High Arctic. The new habitats will make possible the invasion of new insect, mammal, and bird herbivores, as well as their parasites and predators. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Within groups, plants with high and low NPR receive similar numbers of approaches. Plants with high NPR increase the average number of approaches to all plants in the group; therefore, plants with low NPR benefit from nectar-rich plants nearby.

Normally, the path integrator is reset to the zero state whenever the ant returns to the starting point of its foraging journey, the nest. We investigated whether the landmark panorama characterizing the nest entrance suffices to reset the path integrator. We designed an experimental paradigm in which the position where the ants' path integrator was at the zero state (PI position) did not coincide with the position of the nest as marked by the familiar landmark panorama (LM position). Once the ants displaced from the training area to a distant test field had arrived at the PI position, the artificial landmark array defining the nest site was installed at the LM position. The ants immediately headed towards the LM position and searched there persistently. However, upon removal of the landmarks they returned to the PI position. Hence, they ignored information from their path integrator while they concentrated their search at the landmark-defined nest position, but they again relied on their continually updated path integrator as soon as the landmarks had been removed. Although their concentrated search at the LM position showed that the ants had used the landmarks as reliable cues for the position of their nest, this landmark-induced search for the nest entrance did not reset the ant's path integrator. In general, this might mean that geocentric visual cues in themselves are not sufficient to recalibrate the egocentric path integrator. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Naturally occurring wild flowers (i.e. agricultural weeds) offer a free, sustainable, and often underappreciated resource for pollinators, however, they may compete with crop flowers for visits. To understand the extent to which floral resources mediate pollinator visitation to courgette flowers and courgette fields, plant community and pollinator visitation data were collected at two spatial scales: field scale (in margins, and in the cropped area) and farm scale (500 m and 2000 m radii) for nine courgette fields across the UK. Apis mellifera (honeybees) and Bombus spp. (bumblebees) were the only pollinators observed to visit courgette flowers. Bumblebees were significantly more abundant on courgette flowers in fields with a greater species richness of wild flowers in the crop, whilst honeybees were significantly more abundant on courgette flowers in areas with less semi-natural habitat. For both honeybees and bumblebees, their abundance in field margins did not significantly reduce their abundance on courgette flowers, suggesting that wild flowers were not competing with courgette flowers for pollinator visitation. Although solitary bees were not observed to visit courgette flowers, their abundance and species richness in courgette fields were significantly greater with more semi-natural habitat and a greater species richness of wild flowers. Therefore, allowing uncultivated areas around the crop to be colonised by species-rich wild flowers is an effective way of boosting the abundance of bumblebees, which are important visitors to courgette flowers, as well as the abundance and species richness of solitary bees, thereby benefitting pollinator conservation.

Knowledge of their ecology is vital for the design of effective management and conservation strategies but key aspects remain poorly understood. Here we employed microsatellite markers to estimate and compare foraging range and nest density among four UK species: Bombus terrestris, Bombus pascuorum, Bombus lapidarius, and Bombus pratorum. Workers were sampled along a 1.5-km linear transect across arable farmland. Eight or nine polymorphic microsatellite markers were then used to identify putative sisters. In accordance with previous studies, minimum estimated maximum foraging range was greatest for B. terrestris (758 m) and least for B. pascuorum (449 m). The estimate for B. lapidanus was similar to B. pascuorum (450 m), while that of B. pratorum was intermediate (674 m). Since the area of forage available to bees increases as the square of foraging range, these differences correspond to a threefold variation in the area used by bumblebee nests of different species. Possible explanations for these differences are discussed. Estimates for nest density at the times of sampling were 29, 68, 117, and 26/km2 for B. terrestris, B. pascuorum, B. lapidarius and B. pratorum, respectively.

Combining the needs of agricultural production with enhancing biodiversity requires a landscape-scale approach since the geographic scale at which most non-farmed species operate is unconstrained by farm boundaries. Bumblebees are a key component of farmland biodiversity as pollinators of both crops and wild flora. However, the factors determining their densities in such landscapes remain poorly understood. 2. Using a combination of remote-sensed landscape data and molecular markers, we quantify the effects of land use (oilseed rape, field beans and non-cropped areas, all of which provide suitable bumblebee forage), at various spatial scales to find the best predictor of colony density for the bumblebee Bombus pascuorum Scopoli in an arable landscape. 3. Estimated colony density was positively correlated with the area of all habitat categories within 1000 m of the sample site. No significant relationships were found for greater or lesser distances. This concurs with earlier estimates of the foraging range of this species. We found no evidence that nest sizes increased with forage availability, although our data do not allow us to categorically exclude this possibility. 4. It has long been suspected that forage availability limits bee abundance in agricultural landscapes but there is little direct evidence for this. Here we report a direct relationship between floral abundance and bumblebee nest density within a notionally fixed area. Importantly, we suggest that the forage availability within the previously published estimated foraging distance for this species at this location is a good predictor of the scaleof impact of forage provision on nesting density.© 2009 The Royal Entomological Society.","bumblebee nest density and the scale of available forage in","1.

At a volume of 200 l/ha, the initial deposit on Galium was found to be 35 times higher than on Avena. As a modell, three target-specific ranges of water volume are described. With increasing volume, the first range is limited to the volume where runoff begins on the first individuum of the target population. The second range ends when runoff can be observed on all of the targets. Above this volume, the third range represents water volumes that exceed the retention capacity.

We conducted a cost-benefit analysis to assess how managing blue orchard bees (Osmia lignaria Say [Hymenoptera: Megachildae]) alongside honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus [Hymenoptera: Apidae]) can affect profits for almond growers in California. Specifically, we studied how adjusting three strategies can influence profits: (1) number of released O. lignaria bees, (2) density of artificial nest boxes, and (3) number of nest cavities (tubes) per box. We developed an ecological model for the effects of pollinator activity on almond yields, validated the model with published data, and then estimated changes in profits for different management strategies. Our model shows that almond yields increase with O. lignaria foraging density, even where honey bees are already in use. Our cost-benefit analysis shows that profit ranged from -US$1,800 to US$2,800/acre given different combinations of the three strategies. Adding nest boxes had the greatest effect; we predict an increase in profit between low and high nest box density strategies (2.5 and 10 boxes/acre). In fact, the number of released bees and the availability of nest tubes had relatively small effects in the high nest box density strategies. This suggests that growers could improve profits by simply adding more nest boxes with moderate number of tubes in each. Our approach can support grower decisions regarding integrated crop pollination and highlight the importance of a comprehensive ecological economic framework for assessing these decisions.","ecology and economics of using native managed bees for almond","Native managed bees can improve crop pollination, but a general"

Interestingly, no scientific data are available, neither about the past nor the present status of naturally nesting honeybee colonies. We expected near-natural beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests to provide enough suitable nest sites to be a home for feral honey bee colonies in Europe. Here, we made a first assessment of their occurrence and density in two German woodland areas based on two methods, the tracing of nest sites based on forager flight routes (beelining technique), and the direct inspection of potential cavity trees. Further, we established experimental swarms at forest edges and decoded dances for nest sites performed by scout bees in order to study how far swarms from beekeepermanaged hives would potentially move into a forest. We found that feral honey bee colonies regularly inhabit tree cavities in near-natural beech forests at densities of at least 0.11-0.14 colonies/km2. Colonies were not confined to the forest edges; they were also living deep inside the forests. We estimated a median distance of 2,600 m from the bee trees to the next apiaries, while scout bees in experimental swarms communicated nest sites in close distances (median: 470 m).We extrapolate that there are several thousand feral honey bee colonies in German woodlands. These have to be taken in account when assessing the role of forest areas in providing pollination services to the surrounding land, and their occurrence has implications for the species' perception among researchers, beekeepers and conservationists.

Honeybees (genus Apis) are unique in that they communicate the spatial information of resources using a symbolic 'language', the waggle dance. Different honeybee species differ in foraging ecology but it remains unknown whether this shaped variation in the dance. We studied distance dialects-interspecific differences in how waggle duration relates to flight distance-and tested the hypothesis that these evolved to maximize communication precision over the bees' foraging ranges. We performed feeder experiments with Apis cerana, A. florea and A. dorsata in India and found that A. cerana had the steepest dialect, i.e. a rapid increase in waggle duration with increasing feeder distance, A. florea had an intermediate, and A. dorsata had the lowest dialect.

The inverse correlation between foraging range and dialect was corroborated when comparing six (sub)species across the geographical range of the genus including previously published data.

Over the last decades, biodiversity in agricultural landscapes has declined drastically. Initiatives to enhance biodiversity, such as agri-environment schemes, often have little effect, especially in intensively farmed landscapes. The effectiveness of conservation management may be improved by scheme implementation near high-quality habitats that can act as a source of species. We evaluated up to what distance high-quality habitats (nature reserves and artificially created flower-rich patches) affect the diversity of forbs and pollinators in intensively farmed landscapes of the Netherlands. 2. We surveyed forbs, inflorescences, bees and hover flies and estimated pollination services in transects along ditch banks extending 300 m from four nature reserves forming small islands in landscapes dominated by agriculture. 3. In a separate experiment, we surveyed inflorescences, bees and hover flies in 1500 m long transects on farmland adjacent to five newly introduced flower-rich patches and in five control transects. 4. Species density of forbs declined over the first 75 m and species density and abundance of hover flies declined over the first 125 m beyond the nature reserves. Beyond these distances, no further declines were observed. The effects of flower-rich patches were spatially limited. The species density and abundance of bees and hover flies were significantly enhanced in the flower-rich patch, but only the abundance of hover flies was enhanced up to 50 m beyond the patch. 5. Synthesis and applications. In intensively farmed areas, remnant high-quality habitats sustain more abundant and diverse pollinator and forb communities than the surrounding countryside. They do enhance biodiversity on nearby farmland but increases are spatially restricted (< 150 m) and relatively small. These habitats may therefore function only as dispersal sources for ecological restoration sites or agricultural fields under extensification schemes that are located in close proximity. Habitat restoration in intensively used farmland should therefore be implemented preferentially in the immediate vicinity of high-quality habitats. In the short term, newly created flower-rich habitats are no alternative to pre-existing seminatural habitats for the promotion of pollinators on nearby farmland. © 2007 The Authors.","at what spatial scale do high-quality habitats enhance the diversity","1.

Comprehensive analyses focusing on the differential expression profiles of genes between the brains of nurse bees and foragers, or in the mushroom bodies-the brain structure related to learning and memory, and multimodal sensory integration-has identified candidate genes related to honey bee behaviors. Despite accumulating knowledge on the expression profiles of genes related to honey bee behaviors, it remains unclear whether these genes actually regulate social behaviors in the honey bee, in part because of the scarcity of genetic manipulation methods available for application to the honey bee. In this review, we describe the genetic methods applied to studies of the honey bee, ranging from classical forward genetics to recently developed gene modification methods using transposon and CRISPR/Cas9. We then discuss future functional analyses using these genetic methods targeting genes identified by the preceding research. Because no particular genes or neurons unique to social insects have been found yet, further exploration of candidate genes/neurons correlated with sociality through comprehensive analyses of mushroom bodies in the aculeate species can provide intriguing targets for functional analyses, as well as insight into the molecular and neural bases underlying social behaviors.","genetics in the honey bee: achievements and prospects toward the","The European honey bee is a model organism for studying"

In particular, SLCA does not require the estimation of allele frequency in a population. It is difficult to conduct large-scale sampling when studying wild populations, and hence we cannot accurately estimate allele frequency. Therefore, SLCA would solve various problems in estimating social structure, mating behavior, and the dispersal range of wild insect populations, for which the collection of large amounts of data is prohibitive. To illustrate our algorithm, we used two types of actual microsatellite data collected from wild populations of Bombus ardens and Bombus diversus.

Species communities of calcareous grasslands, which are among Europe's most diverse habitats, are severely threatened by the cessation of appropriate traditional management, loss of habitat connectivity and simplification of the surrounding landscape. However, our understanding of these often interrelated factors remains limited, in particular for trait-mediated responses across taxa. Here, we test the independent effects of local management (grazing, mowing and abandonment), habitat connectivity (measured by a connectivity index) and landscape complexity (indicated by the percentage of arable land) on nine taxa: plants, butterflies, bees, grasshoppers, hoverflies, spiders, true bugs, rove beetles and leafhoppers on small semi-natural calcareous grassland remnants (<1ha). LocationCentral Germany. MethodsWe use a joint analysis across taxa to identify general and trait-mediated responses (body size and Red List status) in species richness, abundance and community composition. ResultsWe identified three key drivers of local diversity patterns: First, an increasing proportion of arable land from 10% to 80% led to a 29% loss of overall species richness. Second, despite differences between taxa, increasing habitat connectivity generally enhanced species richness. Connectivity effects were more accentuated in the large species per taxon, which can be expected to be good dispersers. Finally, grazing reduced species richness and abundance much more than annual mowing or short-term abandonment (5-15years), in particular for red-listed species. We attribute this to plant resource removal through overgrazing and trampling. Main conclusionsFor the conservation management of small calcareous grasslands, we advocate an alternating strategy of mowing or lenient grazing and short-term abandonment, prioritizing connected fragments surrounded by diverse landscapes. Despite taxon-specific responses, our study across nine taxa demonstrates universal, trait-mediated effects of management, landscape complexity and connectivity on local biodiversity in fragmented communities.","local and landscape management drive trait-mediated biodiversity of nine taxa","AimBiodiversity across the globe is heavily eroded by intensified management"

Flowers uniform in colour to humans, however, can appear patterned to insects due to spatial variation in UV reflectance on petals. A UV 'bullseye' pattern that is common among angiosperms - UV-absorbing petal bases and UV-reflective apices - purportedly functions as a nectar guide, enhancing pollinator orientation and experimental evidence suggests that UV reflectance increases floral apparency to pollinators. We test the pollinator-attracting and pollinator-orienting functions of floral UV pattern and UV reflectance under natural conditions. Specifically, we address whether UV reflection alone, or UV pattern influences small bee and syrphid fly attraction rates (approaching, landing and foraging visits), foraging rates, and likelihood of foraging and orienting to the centre of flowers, using Argentina anserina, a species whose flowers exhibit variability in the size of the UV bullseye. We manipulated UV properties while maintaining uniformly yellow petals to create three phenotypes - uniformly UV-absorptive, uniformly UV-reflective, and inversed bullseye (reflective bases and absorptive apices) and compared insect visitation and behaviour to control flowers with the common UV bullseye phenotype. The presence of UV pattern increased attraction rates by both bees and syrphid flies relative to either fully UV reflective or absorptive flowers. However, only in the inverse array did the bullseye phenotype elicit higher foraging rates than the test flower. Neither the presence of pattern, nor the reversal of the common pattern influenced the likelihood of pollinator foraging or orientating to the flowers' centre during a visit. We provide some of the first evidence to suggest that flowers with spatial variation in UV reflectance may be more conspicuous to insects than those with petals that uniformly absorb or reflect UV, all of which are naturally occurring phenotypes. Further, we verify that the most common UV pattern in nature increases insect attraction and foraging rate relative to the inverse pattern. Results confirm a distance apparency function of the UV bullseye, but we argue for reconsideration of the notion that pollinators benefit from this ubiquitous floral motif through enhanced foraging efficiency. © 2013 British Ecological Society.","dissecting pollinator responses to a ubiquitous ultraviolet floral pattern in","Summary: Colour patterns on flowers can increase pollinator visitation and"

In spring, M. persicus arrived a few days later and laid up to 2 weeks later than M. apiaster. Spatial distributions of the two species were positively associated. They were sympatric and syntopic: more than half of the local breeding ranges overlapped, and many birds bred within sight and sound of the congener. Intraspecific conflict was frequent, but in mixed colonies interspecific conflict was rare. Most M. apiaster nest burrows were dug into cliffs and most M. persicus ones into level ground, but dense mixed colonies occurred only in cliffs. Burrow architecture differed specifically. Diets were qualitatively similar at insect family level but different at the species level, partly because of local variation in availability and partly because of distinct preferences of M. apiaster for small beetles, ants and termites and of M. persicus for large dragonflies and cicadas. Merops persicus was less specialized than M. apiaster and had an airborne insect prey spectrum nearly twice as broad. Diets were more alike where the two birds foraged together than where they foraged separately. There was a high incidence of egg and nestling loss by predation and starvation. We speculate that each species may prove to breed more successfully in mixed than in monospecific colonies. We propose that the two bee-eaters do not compete for nest sites but may compete for food and coexist unaggressively by trading off food competition against improved breeding success in mixed colonies.","competition and coexistence of the european bee-eater merops apiaster and","Studies were conducted over a 10-year period on the supposedly"

However, WSNs system designers must fulfill the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements imposed by the applications (and users). Very harsh and dynamic physical environments and extremely limited energy/computing/memory/communication node resources are major obstacles for satisfying QoS metrics such as reliability, timeliness, and system lifetime. The limited communication range of WSN nodes, link asymmetry, and the characteristics of the physical environment lead to a major source of QoS degradation in WSNsthe hidden node problem. In wireless contention-based medium access control (MAC) protocols, when two nodes that are not visible to each other transmit to a third node that is visible to the former, there will be a collisioncalled hidden-node or blind collision. This problem greatly impacts network throughput, energy-efficiency and message transfer delays, and the problem dramatically increases with the number of nodes. This paper proposes H-NAMe, a very simple yet extremely efficient hidden-node avoidance mechanism for WSNs. H-NAMe relies on a grouping strategy that splits each cluster of a WSN into disjoint groups of non-hidden nodes that scales to multiple clusters via a cluster grouping strategy that guarantees no interference between overlapping clusters. Importantly, H-NAMe is instantiated in IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee, which currently are the most widespread communication technologies for WSNs, with only minor add-ons and ensuring backward compatibility with their protocols standards. H-NAMe was implemented and exhaustively tested using an experimental test-bed based on off-the-shelf technology, showing that it increases network throughput and transmission success probability up to twice the values obtained without H-NAMe.

During nectar and pollen foraging in a temperate climate, honeybees are exposed to a broad range of ambient temperatures, challenging their thermoregulatory ability. The body temperature that the bees exhibit results from endothermic heat production, exogenous heat gain from solar radiation, and heat loss. In addition to profitability of foraging, season was suggested to have a considerable influence on thermoregulation. To assess the relative importance of these factors, the thermoregulatory behaviour of foragers on 33 flowering plants in dependence on season and environmental factors was investigated. 2. The bees (Apis mellifera carnica Pollman) were always endothermic. On average, the thorax surface temperature (Tth) was regulated at a high and rather constant level over a broad range of ambient temperatures (Tth = 33.7-35.7°C, Ta = 10-27°C). However, at a certain Ta, Tth showed a strong variation, depending on the plants from which the bees were foraging. At warmer conditions (Ta = 27-32°C) the Tth increased nearly linearly with Ta to a maximal average level of 42.6 °C. The thorax temperature excess decreased strongly with increasing Ta (Tth-Ta = 21.6 - 3.6°C). 3. The bees used the heat gain from solar radiation to elevate the temperature excess of thorax, head, and abdomen. Seasonal dependance was reflected in a 2.7 °C higher mean Tth in the spring than in the summer. An anova revealed that season had the greatest effect on Tth, followed by Ta and radiation. 4.

The endothermic temperature excess (difference of Tbody-Ta of living and dead bees) was used to assess the endogenously generated temperature elevation as a correlate of energy turnover. Up to a Ta of ∼30°C bees used solar heat gain for a double purpose: to reduce energetic expenditure and to increase Tth by about 1-3°C to improve force production of flight muscles. At higher Ta they exhibited cooling efforts to get rid of excess heat. A high Tth also allowed regulation of the head temperature high enough to guarantee proper function of the bees' suction pump even at low Ta.

Measurements included total, small and large bee species richness and abundance; stability of total species richness and abundance (coefficient of variation, CV); the nitrogen content of fertilizers; the number of insecticide applications; within-field location; species richness and abundance of insect-pollinated plants; and the percentage of semi-natural areas in a 500-m radius circle around the fields under study.

We focused on two shrub species (hawthorn Crataegus spp., dog rose Rosa canina) and adjacent herb flowering in forest edges, connected hedges, and isolated hedges in Lower Saxony, Germany. We selected 35 landscape circles of 1 km radius, differing in the amount of oilseed rape; 18 were adjacent to oilseed rape and 17 to cereal fields, and we quantified bee density via pan traps at all sites. Adjacent oilseed rape positively affected fruit mass and seed number per fruit of simultaneously flowering hawthorn (no effect on dog rose, which flowers after the oilseed rape bloom). At the landscape scale, oilseed rape had a negative effect on bumble bee density in the hedges during flowering due to dilution of pollinators per unit area and the consequently intensified competition between oilseed rape and wild shrubs, but a positive effect after flowering when bees moved to the hedges, which still provided resources. In contrast, positive landscape-scale effects of oilseed rape were found throughout the season in forest edges, suggesting that edges support nesting activity and enhanced food resources. Our results show that oilseed rape effects on bee abundances and pollination success in seminatural habitats depend on the spatial and temporal scale considered and on the habitat type, the wild plant species, and the time of crop flowering. These scale-dependent positive and negative effects should be considered in evaluations of landscape-scale configuration and composition of crops.

However, frequent tillage results in the degradation of habitat quality and the provision of biodiversity-based ecosystem services. Wild bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants and depend on both, floral resources and suitable nesting sites, which are influenced by the landscape configuration. We examined effects of field and landscape parameters on wild bee species’ richness, abundance and functional traits in Austrian vineyards over two years using Generalised Linear Mixed models, Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Random Forests. Alternating tillage was compared with no tillage in two inter-rows per vineyard. Forage availability in these inter-rows was estimated by flower coverage at each sampling date, and landscape features were analysed within a radius of 750 m around the vineyards. Across all vineyards we found 84 wild bee species with a mean abundance (±SD) of 29 (±16.6). Forage availability had the strongest positive effect on wild bee diversity and abundance. In comparison to no tillage, alternating tillage slightly increased wild bee diversity and abundance. Eusocial wild bees were more abundant in untilled inter-rows, whereas solitary wild bees were more closely associated with alternating tilled vineyards. At the landscape scale, the percentage of artificial areas (mostly villages) and distance to semi-natural elements raised wild bee diversity and abundance. The proportion of woodland increased the abundance of wild bees, in particular of eusocial taxa. Solitary wild bee abundance was enhanced by the number of solitary trees. Pollination provided by wild bees in viticultural areas can be enhanced by maintaining a diversity of different soil management strategies to improve forage availability in vineyards. Furthermore, semi-natural elements such as fallows or solitary trees providing floral resources and nesting habitat should be preserved within viticultural landscapes. © 2018 The Authors","tillage intensity or landscape features: what matters most for wild","Vineyard inter-rows can provide habitats for a range of plant"

Wild bees depend on floral resources and suitable nesting sites which may be found in vineyard inter-rows or in viticultural landscapes. Inter-row vegetation is managed by mulching, tillage, and/or herbicide application and results in habitat degradation when applied intensively. Here, we hypothesize that lower vegetation management intensities, higher floral resources, and landscape diversity affect wild bee diversity and abundance dependent on their functional traits. We sampled wild bees semi-quantitatively in 63 vineyards representing different vegetation management intensities across Europe in 2016. A proxy for floral resource availability was based on visual flower cover estimations. Management intensity was assessed by vegetation cover (%) twice a year per vineyard. The Shannon Landscape Diversity Index was used as a proxy for landscape diversity within a 750 m radius around each vineyard center point. Wild bee communities were clustered by country. At the country level, between 20 and 64 wild bee species were identified. Increased floral resource availability and extensive vegetation management both affected wild bee diversity and abundance in vineyards strongly positively. Increased landscape diversity had a small positive effect on wild bee diversity but compensated for the negative effect of low floral resource availability by increasing eusocial bee abundance. We conclude that wild bee diversity and abundance in vineyards is efficiently promoted by increasing floral resources and reducing vegetation management frequency. High landscape diversity further compensates for low floral resources in vineyards and increases pollinating insect abundance in viticulture landscapes.","response of wild bee diversity, abundance, and functional traits to","Agricultural intensification is a major driver of wild bee decline."

To study the effect of food profitability on the foraging process, we trained foragers to artificial feeders containing different food qualities and studied the individual foraging process with respect to food uptake, foraging cycles, as well as food transfer to nestmates. Our results indicate that foragers of P. hildebrandti adjust foraging behaviors according to the food profitability in a way that may increase colony's efficiency. Furthermore, we studied the influence of different food qualities on the vibrational signals produced by foragers during food transfer. Signal duration, pulse duration, and duty cycle appear to be adjusted according to the food quality, i.e., profitability.

Management of mobile organisms contributing to ecosystem services requires consideration not only of the local scale where services are delivered, but also the distribution of resources at the landscape scale, and the foraging ranges and dispersal movements of the mobile agents. We develop a conceptual model for exploring how one such mobile-agent-based ecosystem service (MABES), pollination, is affected by land-use change, and then generalize the model to other MABES. The model includes interactions and feedbacks among policies affecting land use, market forces and the biology of the organisms involved. Animal-mediated pollination contributes to the production of goods of value to humans such as crops; it also bolsters reproduction of wild plants on which other services or service-providing organisms depend. About one-third of crop production depends on animal pollinators, while 60-90% of plant species require an animal pollinator. The sensitivity of mobile organisms to ecological factors that operate across spatial scales makes the services provided by a given community of mobile agents highly contextual. Services vary, depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources surrounding the site, and on biotic interactions occurring locally, such as competition among pollinators for resources, and among plants for pollinators. The value of the resulting goods or services may feed back via market-based forces to influence land-use policies, which in turn influence land management practices that alter local habitat conditions and landscape structure.

To extend understanding of how shifts in area, biomes, and pollinators impact diversification in plants, we examined the relationships of these shifts to diversification across the mega-genus Salvia. Methods: A chronogram was developed from a supermatrix of anchored hybrid enrichment genomic data and targeted sequence data for over 500 of the nearly 1000 Salvia species. Ancestral areas and biomes were reconstructed using BioGeoBEARS. Pollinator guilds were scored, ancestral pollinators determined, shifts in pollinator guilds identified, and rates of pollinator switches compared. Key Results: A well-resolved phylogenetic backbone of Salvia and updated subgeneric designations are presented. Salvia originated in Southwest Asia in the Oligocene and subsequently dispersed worldwide. Biome shifts are frequent from a likely ancestral lineage utilizing broadleaf and/or coniferous forests and/or arid shrublands. None of the four species diversification shifts are correlated to shifts in biomes. Shifts in pollination system are not correlated to species diversification shifts, except for one hummingbird shift that precedes a major shift in diversification near the crown of New World subgen.

Only a subset of potential pollinators, mainly large bees, learn to successfully forage on such flowers. Thus, complexity may comprise a morphological filter that restricts the range of visitors and thereby increases food intake for successful foragers. Such pollinator specialization, in turn, promotes flower constancy and reduces cross-species pollen transfer, providing fitness benefits to plants with complex flowers. Since visual signals associated with floral morphological complexity are generally honest (i.e., indicate food rewards), pollinators need to perceive and process them. Physiological studies show that bees detect distant flowers through long-wavelength sensitive photoreceptors. Bees effectively perceive complex shapes and learn the positions of contours based on their spatial frequencies. Complex flowers require long handling times by naive visitors, and become highly profitable only for experienced foragers. To explore possible pathways towards the evolution of floral complexity, we discuss cognitive mechanisms that potentially allow insects to persist on complex flowers despite low initial foraging gains, suggest experiments to test these mechanisms, and speculate on their adaptive value. © 2018 by the authors.

Male flowers provide pollen rewards for an extended period of time while female flowers are rewardless and both sexes are visited by generalist insects, mainly by honeybees and stingless bees.

Using a model of honeybee color vision, we found the distance between the color loci of male and female flowers and based on minimum visual angle subtended by these flowers, we suggest that the two floral sexes cannot be discriminated by bees.

However, the routes of exposure have remained largely undefined. We used LC/MS-MS to analyze samples of honey bees, pollen stored in the hive and several potential exposure routes associated with plantings of neonicotinoid treated maize. Our results demonstrate that bees are exposed to these compounds and several other agricultural pesticides in several ways throughout the foraging period. During spring, extremely high levels of clothianidin and thiamethoxam were found in planter exhaust material produced during the planting of treated maize seed. We also found neonicotinoids in the soil of each field we sampled, including unplanted fields. Plants visited by foraging bees (dandelions) growing near these fields were found to contain neonicotinoids as well. This indicates deposition of neonicotinoids on the flowers, uptake by the root system, or both. Dead bees collected near hive entrances during the spring sampling period were found to contain clothianidin as well, although whether exposure was oral (consuming pollen) or by contact (soil/planter dust) is unclear. We also detected the insecticide clothianidin in pollen collected by bees and stored in the hive. When maize plants in our field reached anthesis, maize pollen from treated seed was found to contain clothianidin and other pesticides; and honey bees in our study readily collected maize pollen. These findings clarify some of the mechanisms by which honey bees may be exposed to agricultural pesticides throughout the growing season.

Here we have sequenced and characterized a full-length cDNA encoding a putative iron-binding transferrin (AmTRF) in the honeybee. AmTRF shows high level of sequence identity with transferrins in both vertebrates and insects (26-46%) suggesting that the primary function of the predicted 712 amino acid protein is binding and transporting of iron. AmTRF is expressed ubiquitously, but particularly high levels of its mRNA are found in the central brain and in the compound eye. Using northern blotting and a microarray based approach we have examined the levels of AmTRF mRNA by expression profiling under a wide range of conditions including developmental stages, septic injury and juvenile hormone treatment. Increased expression of AmTRF is seen during early pupal stages, in the brain of mature foragers and in the abdomen of virgin queens, whereas treatment with juvenile hormone leads to a decrease of AmTRF levels in the abdomen. We show that a transcriptional response of transferrin to septic injury with E. coli is relatively moderate as compared to a dramatic up-regulation of an antibacterial polypeptide, Hymenoptaecin, under similar conditions. We conclude that major fluctuations of AmTRF mRNA in time and space are consistent with context-dependent functional significance and suggest broader multifunctional roles for transferrin in insects.","transcriptional profiling reveals multifunctional roles for transferrin in the honeybee,","Transferrins belong to a family of iron-binding proteins that have"

Flower visitation frequency and foraging behavior differed between queen bumblebees and workers. Queens exhibited less frequent flower visits, longer flight distances between inflorescences, and a smaller number of sequential inflorescence visits within patches than did worker bees. Flowering in early-snowmelt populations occurred in June, when only overwintered queens were available, while flowering in late-snowmelt populations occurred from late July to August, when frequent visits by workers were common. The fruit to flower ratio per inflorescence was lower in early-snowmelt populations due to quantitative pollen limitation, while the seed to ovule ratio per fruit was lower in late-snowmelt populations. This is because geitonogamous pollination by workers was common later in the season, which resulted in a high abortion rate of self-pollinated seeds, that is, qualitative pollen limitation. Thus, pollination efficiency, or the type of pollen limitation, shifts during the flowering season, reflecting the seasonal life cycle of bumblebees in the ecosystem.

When the synchrony of flowering and pollinator emergence is disturbed by climate change, seed production may be restricted due to insufficient pollination success. We revealed the mechanism of phenological mismatch between a spring ephemeral (Corydalis ambigua) and its pollinator (overwintered bumblebees), and its impact on plant reproduction, based on 19 years of monitoring and a snow removal experiment in a cool-temperate forest in northern Japan. Early snowmelt increased the risk of phenological mismatch under natural conditions. Seed production was limited by pollination success over the 3 years of the pollination experiment and decreased when flowering occurred prior to bee emergence. Similar trends were detected on modification of flowering phenology through snow removal. Following snowmelt, the length of the pre-flowering period strongly depended on the ambient surface temperature, ranging from 4 days (at greater than 7 degrees C) to 26 days (at 2.5 degrees C). Flowering onset was explained with an accumulated surface degree-day model. Bumblebees emerged when soil temperature reached 6 degrees C, which was predictable by an accumulated soil degree-day model, although foraging activity after emergence might depend on air temperature. These results indicate that phenological mismatch tends to occur when snow melts early but subsequent soil warming progresses slowly. Thus, modification of the snowmelt regime could be a major driver disturbing spring phenology in northern ecosystems.","when spring ephemerals fail to meet pollinators: mechanism of phenological","The flowering phenology of early-blooming plants is largely determined by"

Fixation indices indicated almost complete panmixia within populations, and spatial autocorrelations showed that genotypes were randomly distributed within sites, most likely the result of water dispersal of seeds. Allele frequencies were significantly different among sites, and estimated F-ST indicated moderate genetic differentiation (theta = 0.062). Genetic differences between populations were mostly explained by a gene Bow model that accounted for the location of populations relative to the tidal stream. The importance of hydrochory in affecting spatial genetic structure was thus suggested both within and among H. moscheutos populations.","microgeographic genetic structure and gene flow in hibiscus moscheutos (malvaceae)","Microgeographic genetic variation in populations of a wetland macrophyte, Hibiscus"

We examined the propensity of mites to leave their hosts and to move onto new bee hosts. We also examined their preference for bees of different age and hive function. Mites were standardized by selecting mites from newly emerged worker bees (NEWs). In closed jars, 50% of Varroa left NEWs irreversibly when no physical path was present for the mites to return to the NEWs; about 90% of mites left newly emerged drones in identical assays. In petri dish arenas, mites were rarely seen off NEW hosts when monitored at 15-min intervals for 4 h; this was the case for single NEWs with one mite (NEWs+) and when a NEW+ and a NEW- (no mites) were placed together in a petri dish. When a NEW+ was held with either a nurse bee or a pollen forager, 25% of the mites moved to the older bees. When both a nurse and a pollen forager were placed in a petri dish with a NEW+, about 50% of the mites transferred to older bees; nurse bees received about 80% of these mites, whereas pollen foragers received significantly fewer mites (about 20%. P < 0.05). Most mite transfers occurred during the first 30 min after combining NEWs+ and test bees. When NEWs+ were combined with bees of known ages, rather than function, mites transferred more often to young bees than to older bees (1- and 5-day-old bees vs. 25-day-old bees, P < 0.05; 1-day-old vs. 13- and 25-day-old bees; P < 0.05). No differences in proportions of transferring mites were seen when the range of bee ages was ≤ 8 days (P > 0.05), implying that the factors mediating the mites' adult-host preference change gradually with bee age. A possible chemical basis for host choice by Varroa is indicated by their greater propensity to move onto freezer-killed nurse bees than onto freezer-killed pollen foragers (P < 0.05) and by their lower movement onto heat-treated bees than onto control bees (P < 0.05). Bee age, hive function, and directional changes in cuticular chemistry are all correlated. Movements of newly emerged mites in relation to these variables may provide insights into their reproductive success in Apis mellifera colonies.","transfers of varroa mites from newly emerged bees: preferences for","Movements of the parasitic honey bee mite, Varroa jacobsoni (Oud.)"

The foraging studies, more particularly in litchi flowering season, have given an indication that a minimum range of 5 to 10 honey bee colonies per ha of litchi cultivation should be provided. This study is based on the tentative number of visits of honey bees per panicle in litchi orchards having 144 litchi plants/ha at a spacing of 8.0 m. The extent of pollination and fruit set exclusively by honey bees has been recorded under controlled pollination experiments. The assessment of fruit yield and quality attributes have shown quite encouraging results confirming the significant role of honeybees in planned bee pollination. The response of cross- versus selfpollination through controlled pollination has been found distinct in litchi ('Shahi') fruit production. No fruit set in the case of controlled pollination under cages indicated sterile flowers in the same tree. The present study clearly spelled the need for an abundance of insect pollinators in a planned way for pollen transfer to complete the process of cross pollination and fruit set to achieve potential yield and quality.

Psithyrus females cohabited with host bees for several weeks following their introduction. They did not behave aggressively towards either host queens or workers, although they showed a head-rubbing behaviour, which we interpreted as dominance behaviour, possibly related to pheromone transfer.

Diversity, abundance, and richness of floral resources were also significantly less in ruderal grasslands than in native prairies, indicating that poor floral resource levels may substantially depauperate their bee communities. Common bees dominated the composition of the ruderal grasslands; only one rare species in this study was found at a ruderal site, indicating that high-quality prairie remnants are important reservoirs of bee diversity. Abundance of flowering ramets of a plant species was a significant predictor of the abundance of bees found on that plant. There was also a preference for human-yellow flowers after adjusting for ramet abundance and there were significantly more bees caught in yellow pan traps than blue or white ones.

Several aspects determining pollen flow are measured during the flowering season of the rare plant species Phyteuma nigrum. This self-incompatible species flowers during three weeks in May and June and is mainly pollinated by bumblebees, queens and workers. Visitation rate decreased from early flowering till the end of flowering. Pollen flow is estimated from pollinator foraging distances, measured as inter-inflorescence distance and the overall distance between the first and eleventh inflorescence visited. Special attention is paid to the amount of large distances, the tail of the dispersal graph and the amount of intra-plant movements. Flown distances followed the mean inter-inflorescence distances. However, maximum distances of inter inflorescence movements and of overall distances were larger during early flowering than during peak flowering; during late flowering distances were even smaller than during peak flowering. Observations on individually marked bumblebees appeared to be useful in the explanation of these differences.

The species is self-compatible and largely self-pollinating. Seeds of P. vulgaris have an elaiosome attached to one end and were taken readily by the ant, Lasius niger, which carried the seeds into their nests, often ejecting them again after mutilating the elaiosome. The ants carried the seeds up to 2m. No other adaptations for seed disperal are apparent, but occasional long distance dispersal, eg by wind or on the feet of grazing animals, may have an important effect on the genetic structure of the populations. The large monomorphic groups seem to have established at Oxwich as a result of substantial recolonization from disturbance after 1945. At Whiteford many small recolonizations must follow frequent covering with blown sand leading to a mosaic of small monomorphic patches.

The most important bird dispersers were tui, bellbirds and silvereyes. These birds appear to provide reasonably good quality dispersal: fruits were swallowed whole and the seeds later defecated in germinable condition; birds tended to visit plants for only 1-2 minutes and eat a few mistletoe fruits each time. Germinability of seeds ranged between species from moderate to high (17-96%). None of the study species of mistletoe germinated successfully unless the fruit skin (exocarp) was removed, by hand or by passage through a bird gut. While hand removal of the exocarp gave the same or higher percentage germination as bird removal, in the field bird dispersal is the only effective method of exocarp removal and is therefore essential. Dispersal was limiting at one of three sites studied (Craigieburn), suggesting that reductions in bellbird densities by introduced carnivores or competition for honeydew food sources may be indirectly affecting mistletoe reproduction. Establishment and survival of seedlings on host branches was low (15-28% depending on species to production of first independent leaves, 0-14% after two years). Survival of adults over one year of the study was 80% for Tupeia and 91-95% in the other species, showing that frequent establishment of seedlings is necessary for population maintenance. While disperser limitation does not seem to currently be a major threat to mistletoe survival, it must be considered as a possible factor both historically and in the future.","dispersal, germination and survival of new zealand mistletoes (loranthaceae): dependence","The dispersal, germination and establishment of the New Zealand Loranthaceae"

This behaviour is adaptive because remaining undiscovered is the termite's primary defence against predators such as ants. However, being cryptic severely limits the ability of termites to explore their environment and assess potential food sources. Despite being blind and hidden, termites can assess a piece of wood swiftly after contacting only a small part of it (sometimes as little as a few square millimetres). Such ability has been a mystery. Unlike bees and ants, which have been found to use a range of visual, chemical and vibrational cues for communication, how information is collected and transmitted between termites is poorly known. In addition, the use of chemical communication by termites has been shown to be very limited compared to other social insects. While previous research showed that termite soldiers produce vibratory alarm signals to warn conspecific workers, the role of vibrations in termite foraging behaviour has scarcely been explored. Recent results are presented to demonstrate termites' ability to detect vibration signals and to use the information contained in these signals to make foraging decisions.","vibrations: the key to unlocking the secrets of termite foraging","Termites are notoriously cryptic: infestations in houses are often discovered"

Followers showed similar initial attraction to and tracking of dancers.

The study examined whether foragers can utilize shape (three-dimensional form) information alone as the basis for a complex foraging strategy, and if they can, which strategy is used (e.g., energy maximization, risk aversion, individual constancy)? Horizontal two-dimensional, Vertical two-dimensional, and L-Shape three-dimensional flowers were used in dimorphic artificial flower patches. When rewards were identical in flower morphs, bees showed no uniform preference. Some bees foraged randomly, while other bees had flower morph preferences, but not all to the same flower type. When rewards differed between flower morphs, bees utilized flower form to restrict flower visitation to the morph offering the greater caloric reward. Forager behavior thus conformed only to expectations of the energy maximization model. Forager ''error'' rate (choice of the flower morph offering the lower caloric reward) within flower-form dimorphic patches, however, was approximately three times that observed when only a color dimorphism existed. Bees changed flower morph preference usually on their first visit to the flower patch after rewards were altered, often after visiting just one flower with the lower caloric reward. Increasing accuracy in choosing the more rewarding flower morph on return trips was not generally observed, as might be expected with gradual learning or a prolonged conditioning response.","honey bee (apis mellifera) use of flower form in making","Honey bee forager use of flower pigment patterns (patterns) was"

Six species also undergo minor morphometric changes which discourage visitation. In all species, colour change is non‐inducible by pollinators, taking 2–30 days to complete. In three protandrous species, all available pollen may be removed in the first visit, requiring transport of non‐self pollen to rewardless flowers during the 10 h period of the yellow phase. These species are highly floriferous and occur in dense patches. Since only a small proportion of flowers may be receptive at any one time, it is concluded that retention of flower parts essentially serves to enhance long‐distance attraction, while colour change maximizes pollination and foraging efficiency.

Bombus ephippiatus, a widespread species mostly found in mountains in the Neotropics, seems to use the highlands as island, and deforested lowland areas may represent barriers to their dispersal, leading to isolation and potentially loss of genetic diversity. Yet, lack of knowledge of its population structure does not allow adequate management and conservation. To fill this knowledge gap, we assessed the population structure and inferred dispersion of B. ephippiatus in two mountain-ranges in Guatemala (Volcanic Chain and Sierra de las Minas). This region is characterized by high topographic variation and considerable deforestation strain. We analyzed the effects of elevation and land-use on genetic differentiation of B. ephippiatus populations and inferred its demography in the region. Our results suggest that B. ephippiatus is able to disperse long distances across most landscape types, reflected by its high genetic diversity, high effective population size, considerable gene flow, low population differentiation, as well as the lack of isolation by distance. Hence, B. ephippiatus may be a resilient species for the provision of pollination services. However, we detected a subtle divergence of B. ephippiatus into two clusters, of which Sierra de las Minas has been identified as a regional hotspot of genetic and species endemism. Yet, differentiation is very recent and hence likely caused by lowland deforestation. The combined effects of current forest cover and elevation partially explain the observed subtle patterns of differentiation suggesting that the maintenance of suitable habitat is crucial to ensure population connectivity of this keystone pollinator. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","recent low levels of differentiation in the native bombus ephippiatus","Recent anthropogenic fragmentation has led to population differentiation threatening viability"

Traditional tropical agriculture often entails a form of slash-and-burn land management that may adversely affect ecosystem services such as pollination, which are required for successful crop yields. The Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico has a >4000year history of traditional slash-and-burn agriculture, termed milpa'. Hot Habanero' chilli is a major pollinator-dependent crop that nowadays is often grown in monoculture within the milpa system. 2. We studied 37 local farmers' chilli fields (sites) to evaluate the effects of landscape composition on bee communities. At 11 of these sites, we undertook experimental pollination treatments to quantify the pollination of chilli. We further explored the relationships between landscape composition, bee communities and pollination service provision to chilli. 3. Bee species richness, particularly species of the family Apidae, was positively related to the amount of forest cover. Species diversity decreased with increasing proportion of crop land surrounding each sampling site. Sweat bees of the genus Lasioglossum were the most abundant bee taxon in chilli fields and, in contrast to other bee species, increased in abundance with the proportion of fallow land, gardens and pastures which are an integral part of the milpa system. 4. There was an average pollination shortfall of 21% for chilli across all sites; yet the shortfall was unrelated to the proportion of land covered by crops. Rather, chilli pollination was positively related to the abundance of Lasioglossum bees, probably an important pollinator of chilli, as well indirectly to the proportion of fallow land, gardens and pastures that promote Lasioglossum abundance. 5. Synthesis and applications. Current, low-intensity traditional slash-and-burn (milpa) agriculture provides Lasioglossum spp. pollinators for successful chilli production; fallow land, gardens and pasture therefore need to be valued as important habitats for these and related ground-nesting bee species. However, the negative impact of agriculture on total bee species diversity highlights how agricultural intensification is likely to reduce pollination services to crops, including chilli. Indeed, natural forest cover is vital in tropical Yucatan to maintain a rich assemblage of bee species and the provision of pollination services for diverse crops and wild flowers.","sweat bees on hot chillies: provision of pollination services by","1.

Aerial digital imagery with 10. cm. pixel size and Smartphone captures in the field were used for reference data collection. The flowering species were grouped into functional flowering plant groups. Linear spectral unmixing and Change Vector Analysis (CVA) were used on the bi-temporal AISA/Eagle data to produce a hard cover map showing the spatial distribution, abundance and short-term flowering cycle of melliferous plants. Overall accuracies were slightly higher in the February 2013 imagery at the prime flowering period; all flowering plant groups together (""All"") could be mapped with an overall accuracy of 83% (. n=. 512). The ""White forbs"" flowering plant group was most accurately mapped in both AISA/Eagle acquisition dates. Based on Duncan's inter-class similarity test, the ""White forbs"" group was also most distinct from other flowering plant groups. There is a need to investigate the effect of spectral endmember variability and upscaling options for space-borne monitoring of the floral cycle at key sites in Africa.

We studied forest bee communities in Delaware and Pennsylvania, USA, to better understand how forest bee community structure varies with changing land use and microhabitat quality among small, urban and suburban forest fragments in the mid-Atlantic United States. Our hypotheses were that (1) microhabitat quality would affect relative abundance of bee taxa, (2) surrounding landscape composition would drive local patch colonization-extinction dynamics, and (3) forest patch size would not affect community structure and composition. We found a lack of spatial autocorrelation among forest patches, indicating the importance of individual fragments in the autonomous generation and/or maintenance of bee communities. Community analyses revealed the importance of both landscape context and microhabitat quality in defining forest bee communities. By partitioning beta diversity into its constituent components, we also found that landscape composition drove changes in the relative abundance of taxa, while both landscape and microhabitat characteristics significantly influenced species turnover. Neither landscape composition nor quality of the microhabitat influenced initial site occupancy or colonization-extinction dynamics. Bisected by highways, suburban neighborhoods, agricultural lands, and urban development, many urban and suburban forest patches in the eastern United States are similar in composition to our study sites. As many native forest bees have limited capacity for long-range movement between forest patches, these remaining forest fragments are critical to the conservation of unique and speciose forest bee communities.","local landscapes and microhabitat characteristics are important determinants of urban-suburban","Despite their diversity and abundance, the importance of native, forest"

However, we do not yet know the extent to which bee habitat in the form of urban gardens might contribute to pollination services in surrounding crops. We explored whether gardens might provision pollinators to adjacent agricultural areas by sampling bees from gardens in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area, and estimating typical foraging distances in the context of commercialand residential-scale pollination-dependent crops up to 1000 m from garden study sites. We estimate that garden bees could forage outside of the garden in which they were collected, and that when pollination-dependent crops (commercial-scale or residential-scale) are nearby, 30-50% of the garden bee community could potentially provide pollination services to adjacent crops, if urban bees readily cross boundaries and forage among habitat types. Urban gardens might thus be well-positioned to provision neighboring farms and food gardens with pollination services, or could serve as a refuge for pollinators when forage is scarce or crop management practices are inhospitable. The actual capacity of gardens to serve as a refuge for pollinators from agricultural fields depends upon the extent to which bees forage across habitat types. However, relatively little is known about the degree to which bees move among habitat patches in heterogeneous landscapes. We thus propose a research agenda that can document the extent to which gardens contribute to pollinator health and pollination services at the interface of urban, peri-urban, and rural landscapes. In particular, more data is needed on how landscape context impedes or promotes garden bee movement between habitat types. © 2018 by the authors.","garden pollinators and the potential for ecosystem service flow to","Hedgerows, flowering strips, and natural areas that are adjacent to"

Although, communal gardens were primarily intended to provide fresh, regional food to denizens, these green islands also host a surprisingly high number of wild bee species. The gardens were characterized based on structural elements such as flower frequency, the relative percentage of lawn, trees, shrubs, planted crops and infrastructure (e.g. seating possibilities or garden houses). Further, the effects of different landscape structures surrounding the gardens and distance to the city center were analyzed on the total wild bee species richness and functional traits. Focusing on these putative influencing factors, statistical analyses calculating random decision forests along with generalized linear mixed models were applied. With 113 observed wild bee species, communal gardens provide habitat for a quarter of all known species in Vienna. In conclusion, results revealed that only elements within the gardens had an effect on species richness, with flower frequency as the major positive driver.

To determine site characteristics that influence bee success on reclamation lands, we monitored growth and reproduction of 24 commercially reared bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) colonies placed on 12 former coal mines (aged 2 to 30+ years post-reclamation) in Ohio, U.S.A. Twenty colonies survived the duration of the experiment (May-August 2014). All colonies produced both new queens (mean 21.0 +/- 37.0 SD) and males (36.5 +/- 36.5), in proportion to overall colony size. Results of generalized linear models indicate that colony growth and reproduction increased with floral diversity and species turnover, and declined with site area and the proportion of forest in the surrounding landscape. The sex ratio of reproductive offspring was significantly more male-biased on sites with low flower diversity, underscoring the importance of floral diversity for meeting the higher resource demands of queen production. Floral resource composition and consistency were influenced by site age and surrounding landscape. Older sites had higher floral diversity and species turnover throughout the season than younger sites, and included high-quality native bee forage plants.

The aim of this study was to investigate the habitat use, nesting phenology, and key food plants of spring bumble bee queens. Through 108 nonlethal surveys of bumble bee queens in spring 2018, researchers observed 451 nest seeking and 555 foraging queens of nine species in Ohio, U.S.A. Spring queen activity began in mid-April and peaked in mid -May, although nest seekers were observed into late June. Nest seeking queens favored woody transitional habitats over open habitats. In accordance queen abundance and diversity increased with the proportion of forest in the surrounding landscape. The proportion of row crops and urban areas negatively influenced queen diversity and the number of nest seekers, respectively. Through a literature review, the earliest emergence dates for each species were compared for 12 datasets to establish an order of species emergence in northeastern North America.

In Missouri, where less than 1% the historical prairie remains, prairies are being reconstructed from agricultural or wooded land. Invertebrates are often assumed to colonise reconstructions if native vegetation returns; however, the limited mobility of many invertebrates, the isolation of many tallgrass remnants, and the difficulty in establishing prairie plants raise serious questions as to whether invertebrate communities on reconstructed prairies are and will be equivalent to those found on remnant prairies. Grasshoppers (Acrididae) display a range of dispersal capabilities and may be valuable for assessing the success of prairie restoration for invertebrates. Our first objective was to compare grasshopper communities on reconstructed and remnant prairies and, if differences existed, identify species or functional groups associated with each habitat type. The second objective was to evaluate the effect of time because prairie reconstruction on grasshopper communities to determine if communities on reconstructions are converging with communities on remnants. Our results suggest that prairie reconstructions in Missouri do not support the same communities of grasshoppers as prairie remnants. Grasshopper diversity was generally greater on remnants. Many species had not colonised nearby reconstructions. Communities on prairie reconstructions were characterised by a few long-winged, generalist species that are typically successful in agroecosystems.

We examined factors influencing pollen limitation in Rhexia virginica (Melastomataceae), a species in which pollen transfer depends on bumblebees capable of buzz pollination. Experimental studies were conducted in two populations at Lake Matchedash, southern Ontario, Canada, where the species occurs at the edge of its familial range. 2 Supplemental hand pollination of flowers increased their probability of fruit set compared with open-pollinated control flowers by an average of 57.6%. Pollen limitation was assessed on a per flower basis because the median floral display size at Lake Matchedash was one flower. Pollen limitation was prevalent throughout the 34-week blooming period in one population, whereas in the other it was only evident at the beginning of flowering, despite their close proximity. 3 Bumblebee visits (primarily Bombus impatiens) to R. virginica flowers were infrequent and variable in their occurrence. Visitation was recorded on 14 days during flowering. The median number of visits was 0.65 bees per hour; on 6 days there was virtually no bee activity, but on 2 days visitation rates were high. Variation in pollinator activity was apparently unrelated to local weather conditions. 4 Field experiments demonstrated that the poricidal anthers of R. virginica dispense pollen gradually, with only 10.2% of pollen removed from flowers during a single bumblebee visit. This level of pollen removal is lower than reported in other flowering plants. On average, 47.3% of pollen remained in anthers at the end of anthesis. 5 Investigation of the relation between pollen dispersal and pollen limitation demonstrated a significant negative correlation between the proportion of pollen removed from anthers on a given day and the intensity of pollen limitation. It appears that the pollen-dispensing mechanism of R. virginica and infrequent visitation by bumblebees compromise pollen dispersal, causing pollen limitation in Ontario populations.","the ecology of pollen limitation in buzz-pollinated rhexia virginica (melastomataceae)","1 Pollen limitation of female fertility has often been documented"

Several mathematical models have been put forward as energetically optimal foraging strategies when the food environment is sparse (i.e., the distance between food patches in the environment is much larger than the distance from which the forager can perceive food). In particular, Levy walks with a power law exponent approaching 1 are considered optimal for destructive foragers. However, these models have yet to explore the role of sensory perception in foraging success as the distance between food patches approaches the distance from which the forager can perceive food. Here, we used an agent-based modeling approach to address this question. Our results concur that lower values of the power law exponent (i.e. values approaching 1) result in the most food found, but in contrast to previous studies, we note that, in many cases, lower exponents are not optimal when we consider food found per unit distance traveled. For example, higher values of the exponent resulted in comparable or higher foraging success relative to lower values when the forager's range of sensory perception was restricted to an angle 30 from its current heading. In addition, we find that sensory perception has a larger effect on foraging success than the power law exponent. These results suggest that a deeper examination of how animals perceive food sources from a distance may affect longstanding assumptions regarding the optimality of Levy walk foraging patterns, and lend support to the developing theoretical shift towards models that place increasing emphasis on how organisms interact with their environments.","sensory perception plays a larger role in foraging efficiency than","Animals must balance their rates of energetic intake and expenditure"

V. velutina represents a serious threat to native pollinators. It is known to be a fierce predator of honey bees, but can also hunt wild bees, native wasps, and other flying insects. When V. velutina colonies are developed, many hornets capture foraging bees which are coming back to their hives, causing an increase in homing failure and paralysis of foraging thus leading to colony collapse. The hornets may enter weak beehives to prey on brood and pillage honey. Unlike Apis cerana, Apis mellifera is unable to cope with the predation pressure of V. velutina. Monitoring the spread of an invasive alien species is crucial to plan appropriate management actions and activities to limit the expansion of the species. In addition, an early detection of V. velutina in areas far away from the expansion front allows a rapid response aimed to remove these isolated populations before the settlement of the species.

The study was carried out in a fragmented rainforest landscape in north Queensland and movements were determined by radio-telemetry. Bars carried 6 times more pollen than birds, but were less frequent visitors to S. cormiflorum, suggesting that the quantity of pollen distributed by the two groups may not differ greatly. However. pollen quality (the geographic genetic distance moved) may be a more important factor in determining pollinator effectiveness. Bats were very mobile in the fragmented landscape, with home ranges varying from 12 to 1796 ha and often encompassing more than one forest fragment. Bats usually moved along strips of vegetation, but were found to fly; up to 5.8 km (mean = 1 km) across cleared land. This mobility led to similar numbers of S. australis being caught in small (< 50 ha) forest fragments and continuous forest. At the scale of individual trees, bats fed for an average of 1.2 min per tree, compared to 5.0 min for birds. Short foraging rimes per tree and frequent movements of > 200 m should increase the opportunity for movement of pollen between individual trees. Collectively, these observations suggest that S, australis carry pollen of high quality. Although they fly across cleared land, fragmentation may impact bat populations by allowing increased owl predation in open country and by increasing the reliance of bats on flower resources in the agricultural matrix. On the Atherton Tablelands, the latter is provided mostly by cultivated bananas (Musa sp.), which produce nectar but not pollen. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

One conspicuous threat to bumble bees is their unintended exposure to trace residues of systemic neonicotinoid pesticides, such as imidacloprid, which are ingested when bees forage on the nectar and pollen of treated crops. However, the demographic consequences for bumble bees of exposure to dietary neonicotinoids have yet to be fully established. To determine whether environmentally realistic levels of imidacloprid are capable of making a demographic impact on bumble bees, we exposed queenless microcolonies of worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, to a range of dosages of dietary imidacloprid between zero and 125 μg L -1 and examined the effects on ovary development and fecundity. Microcolonies showed a dose-dependent decline in fecundity, with environmentally realistic dosages in the range of 1 lg L-1 capable of reducing brood production by one third. In contrast, ovary development was unimpaired by dietary imidacloprid except at the highest dosage. Imidacloprid reduced feeding on both syrup and pollen but, after controlling statistically for dosage, microcolonies that consumed more syrup and pollen produced more brood. We therefore speculate that the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on fecundity emerge principally from nutrient limitation imposed by the failure of individuals to feed. Our findings raise concern about the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations.

After that, the pollen host selection and pollen foraging activity of the bee species were also determined. The average daily harvest of pollen loads per honey bee colony was 8.5 g to 127.2 g. The pollen flow through the colonies was the highest during spring, followed by winter and summer, whereas during the monsoon it was the lowest. The weight of a single pollen load ranged from 3.22 mg to 11.73 mg and greatly varied within each season, but seasonal average values do not statistically differ. Families that contributed major amount of biomass were Arecaceae, Myrtaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Pedaliaceae and Apiaceae. Taxa providing large amounts of biomass were Brassica nigra, Eucalyptus globulus, Borassus flabellifer, Sesamum indicum, Acacia auriculiformis, Coriandrum sativum, Cocos nucifera, Phoenix sylvestris and Mikania scandens (Asteraceae). As the bee species foraged on 26.32% (80 plant taxa) of the local angiosperm flora, the broad polylecty category was inferred. The pollen host selection by the bee species significantly depends on the flower availability index (FAi) and pollen availability index (PAi) rather than on an individual flower's pollen quality (in term of pollen morphological characteristics and crude protein content) and pollen quantity (number of pollen grains/flower and amount of pollen biomass/flower).

Solitary bees were caught with colored pan traps in 15 margins of OSR fields and 35 margins of non-OSR fields. We found that solitary bee abundance and species richness were higher in margins of OSR fields than in margins of non-OSR fields, showing that early spring-flying species widely use this mass flowering crop. However the high number of rare species in margins of non-OSR fields (21 species recorded exclusively in these margins) highlighted the importance of these margins for the conservation of solitary bee diversity. The influence of the landscape context on solitary bees showed contrasted results according to the type of margin and the spatial scale. At the finest spatial scale, abundance in margins of OSR fields increased with increasing proportion of non-flowering crops (cereals and temporary grasslands) in the current year. At large spatial scales, solitary bee abundance in margins of non-OSR fields was positively affected by the proportion of long-term grasslands. Moreover, the proportion of fields only sown with cereals during the last 5 years negatively affected abundance and species richness at the large scales whereas the proportion of mixed fields (at least 1 year of grassland in the rotation) had a positive effect on species richness. We showed that accounting for the cumulative effects of field cover and management through the crop rotations is relevant for studying solitary bee communities. The introduction of less intensive covers, such as temporary grasslands, in cereal rotations positively influences these communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The degree of connectivity implies using alternative conservation prioritizations based on the appropriate spatial scale for management units. In species with low population connectivity, it is important to preserve local populations in order to maintain the species throughout its range. In contrast, species with high connectivity require extensive management aiming at preserving gene flow through the entire species range. Here we examine at the continental scale the relationship between inter-population/inter-individual genetic and geographical distances to study the isolation-by-distance (IBD) pattern within the European range of nine wild bee species. We then assess the suitability of multi-local or extensive conservation to ensure their long-term survival. Results based on inter-population differences show only two out of nine species with significant IBD. European bee populations seem quite connected when their IBD is compared to IBD of other phyla. However, our results based on inter-individual distances show that eight out of nine species display significant IBD. These different results are presumably a consequence of potential limitations of the inter-population approach. Therefore, we speculate that the inter-population approach could result in inaccurate IBD estimations. This approach should therefore be replaced by the inter-individual approach in order to provide strong supported conservation guidelines. We support multi-local conservation programs based on our analysis of inter-individual distances.","conservation genetics of european bees: new insights from the continental","Population connectivity is an important source of information for planning"

The foraging behaviour of these pollinators was observed in two environment types to determine their patch-leaving decisions. The rich environment was composed of male-fertile flowers, offering pollen and nectar, and the poor one of male-sterile flowers, offering little nectar and no pollen. The experimental design consisted of a patch system in which inflorescences were evenly arranged in two rows (1 m distance). Residence times of foragers inside inflorescences and rows were analysed by a Cox proportional hazards model, taking into account recent and past experience acquired during the foraging bout. Most of the results showed a decremental motivational mechanism, that is, a reduction in the residence time on the inflorescence or in the row related to exploitation of flowers within inflorescences and inflorescences within rows These results indicate that bumblebees tend to leave the patch using departure rules similar to those found in parasitoids. The results also provide information on the memory, learning and evaluating capabilities of bumblebees especially when rich and poor environments were compared.

They learn about landmarks both when approaching and when leaving the site. Whereas learning on arrival can take place on every visit to the food source, learning on departure is limited to the first few visits, when the bee Turns Back and Looks (TBL) at the feeder in a stereotyped manoeuvre before flying off. We investigated whether one specific function of TBLs is to acquire information about the absolute distance of landmarks from the feeding site. Bees were trained to forage from a feeder which lay at a fixed distance from a cylinder. During training, bees were exposed to the cylinder either only while they approached and landed on the feeder, or only on their departure from it, or at both of these times. Tests on trained bees immediately after the TBL phase revealed that those bees which had viewed the cylinder only on arrival had learnt the apparent size of the cylinder, but not its distance from the feeder. In contrast, bees which saw the cylinder on departure had learnt its absolute distance. They also learnt the cylinder's apparent size, provided that the cylinder was close to the feeder. Bees which had viewed the cylinder on arrival as well as on departure learnt both absolute distance and apparent size. Distance dominated the bees' behaviour in the initial phase of learning, apparent size was more important later on. We suggest that early during learning bees need information about the 3-D structure of the environment so that they can identify those landmarks close to a foraging site which will specify accurately the site's position. This information is acquired during TBLs. Later, landmark guidance can be achieved by 2-D image matching. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","approaching and departing bees learn different cues to the distance","Bees learn both the absolute distance and the apparent size"

The outcome of the comparisons is discussed in the light of anatomical and optical regional specializations found in the bee's peripheral visual pathway, as well as in the light of the foraging bee's natural habits.

The Levy search pattern is inspired by the foraging pattern exhibited by social insects such as honeybees, albatrosses, etc. We consider two Levy-distributed search patterns - a Levy timed search and a Levy looped search, and determine their performance in locating and tracking mobile as well as stationary targets. Our results show that for locating stationary targets, the Levy length for a search leg is strongly correlated with the distance of the target from the location where the search starts. For locating and tracking mobile targets, we find that the search performance improves as the p.d.f. of the Levy distribution is made flatter. The Levy looped search also performs better than the Levy timed search in tracking mobile targets because its looping property helps in relocating targets that have been observed previously.","levy distributed search behaviors for mobile target locating and tracking","We consider the problem, of tracking visually identifiable mobile targets"

We approach this problem through a study of image matching, a navigational strategy in which insects reach a familiar place by moving so that their current retinal image transforms to match a memorized snapshot of the scene viewed from that place. Analysis of how navigating wood ants correct their course when close to a goal reveals a significant part of the mechanism underlying this transformation. Ants followed a short route to an inconspicuous feeder positioned at a fixed distance from a vertical luminance edge. They responded to an unexpected jump of the edge by turning to face the new feeder position specified by the edge. Importantly, the initial speed of the turn increased linearly with the turn's amplitude. This correlation implies that the ants' turns are driven initially by their prior calculation of the angular difference between the current retinal position of the edge and its desired position in their memorized view. Similar turns keep ants to their path during unperturbed routes. The neural circuitry mediating image-matching is thus concerned not only with the storage of views, but also with making exact comparisons between the retinal positions of a visual feature in a memorized view and of the same feature in the current retinal image.","image-matching during ant navigation occurs through saccade-like body turns controlled","Visual memories of landmarks play a major role in guiding"

However, there is some inconsistency in the literature as to how these communities should best be managed. To address this issue, we collected bees from an intensively managed agricultural region in eastern Australia using blue vane traps. Both linear remnants of vegetation, which form part of a larger corridor network, and adjacent fields of native and exotic pastures, wheat, canola, and lucerne were sampled. A total of 3249 individual bees, representing four families and 36 species were collected. Highly modified environments of nectar-bearing crop supported the most species-rich bee assemblages, and the highest abundance of individual bee species. Distance from the remnants did not limit the body size of species occupying fields (up to 400 m). However, richness of bee assemblages also responded positively to the presence of conservation land in nearby areas, or the number of remnant native trees surrounding traps. Linear remnants of native vegetation contributed to assemblage heterogeneity by adding unique species to the regional pool. Our findings indicate that agricultural industries that currently rely on pollination by A. mellifera should ensure that intensive land use is complemented by untilled areas in the form of conservation land, or farm dams and scattered trees in fields, to support wild pollinators that may act as insurance against further future losses of managed hives.

We counted the foragers that a colony allocated to each of nine feeders containing 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 M sucrose solution [31, 43, and 55% sucrose (wt/wt), respectively] at distances of 10, 15, and 20 m from the nest.

At the 10-m feeders, 4.9-fold more foragers visited 2.0 M as compared to 1.0 M sucrose feeders. Colony forager allocation thus responded to both differences in food distance and quality even when the travel cost was negligible compared to normal colony foraging distances (10 m vs. an estimated 800-1 710 m).

Three years of data on the spatio-temporal distributions of 91 bee species show that seasonal patterns of abundance and species richness in human-altered landscapes varied significantly less compared to natural habitats in which floral resources are relatively scarce in the dry summer months. These findings demonstrate that anthropogenic environmental changes in urban and agricultural systems, here mediated through changes in plant resources and water inputs, can alter the temporal dynamics of pollinators that depend on them.

This model predicts size selection in any likely situation and is thus rejected. Instead, the parents appeared to bring food to their young only after having satisfied their own hunger.

Dispersal was measured by taking DNA samples from workers in the spring and summer, and from queens in the following spring, at 14 sites across a landscape. The queens captured in the spring must be full sisters of workers that were foraging in the previous year. A range of sibship reconstruction methods were compared using simulated data sets including or no genotyping errors. The program Colony gave the most accurate reconstruction and was used for our analysis of queen dispersal. Comparison of queen dispersion with worker foraging distances was used to take into account an expected low level of false identification of sister pairs which might otherwise lead to overestimates of dispersal. Our data show that Bombus pascuorum and B. lapidarius queens can disperse by at least 3 and 5 km, respectively. These estimates are consistent with inferences drawn from studies of population structuring in common and rare bumblebee species, and suggest that regular gene flow over several kilometres due to queen dispersal are likely to be sufficient to maintain genetic cohesion of ubiquitous species over large spatial scales whereas rare bumblebee species appear unable to regularly disperse over distances greater than 10 km.

Greater understanding is needed of the effects of secondary metabolites in nectar on the foraging behaviour and performance of pollinators, and on plant-pollinator interactions. We investigated how nectar-feeding birds, both specialist (white-bellied sunbirds Cinnyris talatala) and generalist (dark-capped bulbuls Pycnonotus tricolor and Cape white-eyes Zosterops virens), respond to artificial nectar containing the alkaloid nicotine, present in nectar of Nicotiana species. Preference tests were carried out with a range of nicotine concentrations (0.1-300 M) in two sucrose concentrations (0.25 and 1 M), and for bulbuls also in two sugars (sucrose and hexose). In addition, we measured short-term feeding patterns in white-bellied sunbirds that were offered nicotine (0-50 M) in 0.63 M sucrose. Both nicotine and sugar concentrations influenced the response of bird pollinators to nicotine. The birds showed dose-dependent responses to nicotine; and their tolerance of high nicotine concentrations was reduced on the dilute 0.25 M sucrose diet, on which they increased consumption to maintain energy intake. White-bellied sunbirds decreased both feeding frequency and feeding duration as the nicotine concentration in artificial nectar increased. Of the three species, bulbuls showed the highest tolerance for nicotine, and sugar type (sucrose or hexose) had no effect. The indifference of bulbuls to nicotine may be related to their primarily frugivorous diet. However, the response of white-eyes to nicotine in the dilute sucrose solution was very similar to that of sunbirds, even though white-eyes are generalist nectar-feeders. Additional testing of other avian nectarivores and different secondary metabolites is required to further elucidate whether generalist bird pollinators, which utilise dilute nectars in which secondary metabolites have stronger deterrent effects, are more tolerant of toxic' nectar.","bird pollinators differ in their tolerance of a nectar alkaloid","Although the function of nectar is to attract and reward"

Mass spectrometry prote-omic methods were used to compare the microbial communities in wasp populations in the native (Belgium and England) and invaded range (Argentina and New Zealand). We found no evidence of enemy release, as the number of microbial taxa was similar in both the introduced and native range. However, some evidence of distinctiveness in the microbial communities was observed between countries. The pathogens observed were similar to a variety of taxa observed in honey bees.

New fossil data, comprehensive information on Mesozoic and Cenozoic coastline positions and the availability of phylogenetically informative DNA markers now makes it feasible to test these hypotheses for some groups of bees. This paper presents historical biogeographical analyses of the genus Xylocopa Latreille, based on phylogenetic analyses of species belonging to 22 subgenera using molecular data from two nuclear genes, elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), combined with previously published morphological and mitochondrial data sets. Phylogenetic analyses based on parsimony and likelihood approaches resulted in several groups of subgenera supported by high bootstrap values (>85%): an American group with the Oriental/Palaearctic subgenera Nyctomelitta and Proxylocopa as sister taxa; a geographically diverse group (Xylocopa s.l); and a group consisting of African and Oriental subgenera. The relationships among these three clades and the subgenus Perixylocopa remained unresolved. The Oriental subgenus Biluna was found to be the sister group of all other carpenter bee subgenera included in this study. Using a relaxed molecular clock calibrated using fossil carpenter bees, we show that the major splits in the carpenter bee phylogeny occurred well after the final breakup of Gondwanaland (the separation of South America and Africa, 100 Mya), but before important Miocene fusion events. Ancestral area analysis showed that the genus Xylocopa most likely had an Oriental-Palaearctic origin and that the present world distribution of Xylocopa subgenera resulted mainly from independent dispersal events. The influence of Pleistocene glaciations on carpenter bee distributions is also discussed. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London.","molecular phylogeny and historical biogeography of the large carpenter bees,","The biogeographical history of major groups of bees with worldwide"

As the European landscape is regimented through the introduction of isolation distances and buffer zones, bees and other pollinating insects have become vectors of 'genetic pollution', disrupting the project of cohabitation and purification devised by European authorities. Drawing on the work of Michel Serres on parasitism, this paper traces the emergence of bees as an object of regulatory scrutiny and as an interruptor of the 'coexistence' project.

To determine the relative roles of additive and nonadditive genetic effects (e.g., genetic compatibility, epistasis, and parent-of-origin imprinting effects) on worker behavior, we performed controlled crosses using the Argentine ant Linepithema humile. Three of the measured behaviors (the efficiency to collect pupae, the foraging propensity, and the distance between non-brood-tenders and brood) were affected by the maternal genetic background and the two others (the efficiency to feed larvae and the distance between brood-tenders and brood) by the paternal genetic background. Moreover, there were significant interactions between the maternal and paternal genetic backgrounds for three of the five behaviors. These results are most consistent with parent-of-origin and genetic compatibility effects on division of labor.

We analyzed bee flight movements in an array of four artificial flowers maximizing interfloral distances. Starting from a single patch, we sequentially added three new patches so that if bees visited them in the order in which they originally encountered flowers, they would follow a long (suboptimal) route. Bees' tendency to visit patches in their discovery order decreased with experience. Instead, they optimized their flight distances by rearranging flower visitation sequences. This resulted in the development of a primary route (trapline) and two or three less frequently used secondary routes. Bees consistently used these routes after overnight breaks while occasionally exploring novel possibilities.

Despite being taxonomically widespread, these routing behaviours remain poorly understood due to the difficulty of tracking the foraging history of animals in the wild. Here we examine how bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) develop and optimise traplines over large spatial scales by setting up an array of five artificial flowers arranged in a regular pentagon (50 m side length) and fitted with motion-sensitive video cameras to determine the sequence of visitation. Stable traplines that linked together all the flowers in an optimal sequence were typically established after a bee made 26 foraging bouts, during which time only about 20 of the 120 possible routes were tried. Radar tracking of selected flights revealed a dramatic decrease by 80% (ca. 1500 m) of the total travel distance between the first and the last foraging bout. When a flower was removed and replaced by a more distant one, bees engaged in localised search flights, a strategy that can facilitate the discovery of a new flower and its integration into a novel optimal trapline. Based on these observations, we developed and tested an iterative improvement heuristic to capture how bees could learn and refine their routes each time a shorter route is found. Our findings suggest that complex dynamic routing problems can be solved by small-brained animals using simple learning heuristics, without the need for a cognitive map. © 2012 Lihoreau et al.","radar tracking and motion-sensitive cameras on flowers reveal the development","Central place foragers, such as pollinating bees, typically develop circuits"

This study tested experimentally the effect of variation in worker number (ranging from four to 12 adults) on a microcolony's capacity to regulate brood temperature and recover from acute cold exposure. Microcolonies were provided with ad libitum sugar syrup and minimal insulation and maintained at an ambient temperature of c. 25 degrees C.

However, relatively little is known about the effects of oil palm expansion on biodiversity, especially in key ecosystem-service providing organisms like pollinators. Rapid land use change is exacerbated by limited knowledge of the mechanisms causing biodiversity decline in the tropics, particularly those involving landscape features. We examined these mechanisms by undertaking a survey of orchid bees, a well-known group of Neotropical pollinators, across forest and oil palm plantations in Costa Rica. We used chemical baits to survey the community in four regions: continuous forest sites, oil palm sites immediately adjacent to forest, oil palm sites 2km from forest, and oil palm sites greater than 5km from forest. We found that although orchid bees are present in all environments, orchid bee communities diverged across the gradient, and community richness, abundance, and similarity to forest declined as distance from forest increased. In addition, mean phylogenetic distance of the orchid bee community declined and was more clustered in oil palm. Community traits also differed with individuals in oil palm having shorter average tongue length and larger average geographic range size than those in the forest. Our results indicate two key features about Neotropical landscapes that contain oil palm: 1) oil palm is selectively permeable to orchid bees and 2) orchid bee communities in oil palm have distinct phylogenetic and trait structure compared to communities in forest.

This paper has the objective to review information on the species' geographic distribution, reproductive biology, genetic characteristics and existing conservation practices, and to identify knowledge gaps to orientate future conservation and research focus. The literature review revealed that the species is mainly outcrossed and is pollinated by a diversity of vectors, including bats that allow long-pollen dispersal. When bats are absent, pollination is mainly carried out by honey bees and stingless bees and in such case pollen-mediated gene flow is relatively restricted. Data of a large-scale genetic study based on allozyme markers showing a moderate genetic differentiation among populations were reanalyzed using an inverse distance weighted interpolation function. Three distinctive regions of diversity based on allelic richness and expected heterozygosity were identified. Finally, we discuss future challenges for genetic conservation by emphasizing the need to use both neutral and adaptive markers in future research. © 2018 Silvae Genetica.

To keep track of local time, these clocks use a variety of time cues such as light-dark, temperature, food availability and social interaction cycles. This study assessed the role of social cues in modulating circadian clocks of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Using pair-wise interactions, we first estimated the percentage contribution of each interacting partner on the cumulative rhythmic behaviour of the pairs. Subsequently, we studied the effects of multi-individual (group-wise) interactions on the rhythmic behaviour of the group by estimating phase synchrony between individuals of different strains (having different circadian periods) maintained in both homogeneous and heterogeneous groups. Although it is known that social interactions improve synchrony between interacting individuals, we asked whether such interactions are able to synchronize the circadian rhythms of highly phase-desynchronized flies. We found that, although interactions between fly strains possessing different circadian periods failed to produce synchrony, social interactions among phase-desynchronized flies did enhance the phase synchrony of the interacting individuals. Differently phased individuals living in social groups displayed significantly greater phase synchrony than those living solitarily. Social synchronization is olfaction mediated as group-wise interactions among phase-desynchronized flies possessing compromised olfactory ability (Or83b(0)) did not improve phase synchrony. These results suggest that social cues synchronize the circadian clocks of Drosophila provided that the interacting individuals have similar clock periods.","social synchronization of circadian locomotor activity rhythm in the fruit","Circadian clocks regulate the physiology and behaviour of organisms across"

Pollen-free worker bees either pinned at the hive entrance or released in the hive obtained very little cotton pollen on their bodies from nestmate contacts, although all of them obtained large amounts of pollen from other plant species. Seed set on CMS plants did not decrease significantly with distance from MF plants in 1988 when foraging activity on CMS plants was high relative to that in 1989. In 1989 when there was less foraging activity on CMS flowers, seed set on CMS plants decreased significantly with distance from the MF row.

Worldwide declines in bee populations have raised awareness about the importance of their ecological role in maintaining ecosystem functioning. The naturally strong philopatric behavior that some bee species show can be detrimental to population viability through increased probability of inbreeding. Furthermore, bee populations found in human-altered landscapes, such as urban areas, can experience lower levels of gene flow and effective population sizes, increasing potential for inbreeding depression in wild bee populations. In this study, we investigated the fine-scale population structure of the solitary bee Colletes inaequalis in an urbanized landscape. First, we developed a predictive spatial model to detect suitable nesting habitat for this ground nesting bee and to inform our field search for nests.We genotyped 18 microsatellites in 548 female individuals collected from nest aggregations throughout the study area. Genetic relatedness estimates revealed that genetic similarity among individuals was slightly greater within nest aggregations than among randomly chosen individuals. However, genetic structure among nest aggregations was low (Nei's G<inf>ST</inf> = 0.011). Reconstruction of parental genotypes revealed greater genetic relatedness among females than among males within nest aggregations, suggesting male-mediated dispersal as a potentially important mechanism of population connectivity and inbreeding avoidance. Size of nesting patch was positively correlated with effective population size, but not with other estimators of genetic diversity. We detected a positive trend between geographic distance and genetic differentiation between nest aggregations. Our landscape genetic models suggest that increased urbanization is likely associated with higher levels of inbreeding. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of density and distribution of suitable nesting patches for enhancing bee population abundance and connectivity in human dominated habitats and highlights the critical contribution of landscape genetic studies for enhanced conservation and management of native pollinators. © 2015 López-Uribe et al.","nest suitability, fine-scale population structure and male-mediated dispersal of a","Bees are the primary pollinators of flowering plants in almost"

Palaeoclimatic instability is a major mechanism of lineage diversification in taxa with low dispersal and small geographical ranges in tropical ecosystems. However, the impact of these climatic events remains questionable for the diversification of species with high levels of gene flow and large geographical distributions. In this study, we investigate the impact of Pleistocene climate change on three Neotropical orchid bee species (Eulaema bombiformis, E. meriana and E. cingulata) with transcontinental distributions and different physiological tolerances. We first generated ecological niche models to identify species-specific climatically stable areas during Pleistocene climatic oscillations. Using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear markers, we inferred calibrated phylogenies and estimated historical demographic parameters to reconstruct the phylogeographical history of each species. Our results indicate species with narrower physiological tolerance experienced less suitable habitat during glaciations and currently exhibit strong population structure in the mitochondrial genome. However, nuclear markers with low and high mutation rates show lack of association with geography. These results combined with lower migration rate estimates from the mitochondrial than the nuclear genome suggest male-biased dispersal.

It has been theorized that life-history traits may constrain some species in their dispersal and lead to greater signatures of population genetic structure. In this study, we use a quantitative comparative approach to assess if patterns of population genetic structure in bees are driven by three key species-level life-history traits: body size, sociality, and diet breadth. Specifically, we reviewed the current literature on bee population genetic structure, as measured by the differentiation indices Nei's G(ST,) Hedrick's G '(ST), and Jost's D. We then used phylogenetic generalised linear models to estimate the correlation between the evolution of these traits and patterns of genetic differentiation. Our analyses revealed a negative and significant effect of body size on genetic structure, regardless of differentiation index utilized. For Hedrick's G '(ST) and Jost's D, we also found a significant impact of sociality, where social species exhibited lower levels of differentiation than solitary species. We did not find an effect of diet specialization on population genetic structure. Overall, our results suggest that physical dispersal or other functions related to body size are among the most critical for mediating population structure for bees. We further highlight the importance of standardizing population genetic measures to more easily compare studies and to identify the most susceptible species to landscape and climatic changes.","a trait-based approach to predict population genetic structure in bees","Understanding population genetic structure is key to developing predictions about"

Such trait changes may drastically alter the outcome of pollination mutualisms on plants; however, the direct role of fire on these mutualisms is poorly known. METHODS: Following a pair of fires in the northern California coast range chaparral, we censused floral visitor communities of Trichostema laxum (Lamiaceae), quantified visiting bee behavior, and estimated outcrossing rates using a widespread Mendelian recessive floral polymorphism across a matrix of populations in burned and unburned sites. We also compared pre- and postfire floral visitation in two populations. RESULTS: Outcrossing rates were significantly lower in burned areas; however, our data suggest that the much larger size of plants in burned areas, not burn status itself, drove this pattern. Large-bodied bees dominated floral visitor communities after fire, likely recruiting to the abundant postfire floral resources. These bees visited more flowers per plant than did the smaller bees prevalent before fire and in unburned areas, likely increasing selfing through geitonogamy (within-plant pollination), an effect made possible by the far larger size of plants in burned areas. CONCLUSIONS: Outcrossing rates dropped substantially after wildfires because of changes in the pollinators, plant display size, and their interactions. Reductions in outcrossing following fire may have important implications for population resilience and evolution in a changing climate with more frequent fires.","effects of wildfire on floral display size and pollinator community","PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Wildfire changes the demography, morphology, and"

However, the available data are limited and inconclusive in the case of the frequency of wing beats. Therefore, in this study, the hypothesis that the wing beats convey information about the foraging distance was re-examined. Honeybee dances were recorded using a high-speed camera, and foraging distances were decoded from the duration of waggle phases. Dancing honeybees moved their wings for almost half (47%) of the duration of waggle phases. The number of wing-beating pulses and the combined duration of wing beating were strongly positively correlated with the duration of waggle phases (p <.0014), whereas the mean frequency of wing beats, the mean duration of wing-beating pulses and the mean number of wing beats in one wing-beating pulse were not correlated with the duration of waggle phases (p >.05). Nevertheless, both the mean frequency of wing beats and the mean number of wing beats in one wing-beating pulse were positively correlated with the mean frequency of abdomen waggles (p <.0014). They were also positively correlated with the mean frequency of wing-beating pulses (p <.0014). The correlation matrix revealed that there were two groups of dance components that were positively correlated within groups, but negatively correlated between groups. One of the groups provided information about distance to the food source. We hypothesise that the other group, including the number of wing beats in one pulse, the frequency of wing beats, the frequency of wing-beating pulses and the frequency of abdomen waggles, may provide information about the motivational state of foragers. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","importance of wing movements for information transfer during honey bee","There is growing evidence indicating that dancing honeybees can transfer"

In this study, wing and abdomen movements occurring during social interactions between bees were recorded using a high-speed camera. Wing beating was observed in queens, workers and drones. Some of the observed behaviors were reported earlier, but many of them were described here for the first time including drones moving their wings while leaving the nest for mating flights, workers trying to evict them from the nest or in a colony with drone-laying queen, and workers vibrating their wings in contact with a queen outside of the process of swarming, in turns with a shaking signal or while evicting drones from the nest. Queens moved their wings with significantly higher frequency, performing longer pulses of wing beats than drones and workers. Drones vibrated their wings with the frequency similar to workers, but they performed significantly shorter pulses of wing beating. In workers, the frequency of wing beats and the duration of wing-beating pulses were significantly different among various behaviors. Wing beating was performed by bees relatively often in many social contexts and it differed in frequency and pulse duration, which indicates that wing beating may be used for transferring information. High-speed video recording revealed a wide range of new behaviors which may play an important role in honey bee communication. Therefore, it may be used as an alternative or addition to recordings made with microphones and laser vibrometers.","use of high-speed video recording to detect wing beating produced","Honey bees use many signals to communicate and coordinate different"

Direct effects include mortality, injury, and displacement affecting at most two generations adults and any immature progeny present during the fire. To study the direct effects of fire on bees, two criteria must be met. First, bees must be sampled soon after the fire event, before colonists arrive from outside the burn. Second, sampling locations must be far enough into the burned habitat to ensure that bees observed are survivors, and not foragers nesting outside the burn. 2. Bees were systematically sampled far inside (>7 km) and outside the burn perimeter immediately following a massive wildfire that burned primarily at night in sagebrush steppe habitat. Because adult females sleep in their nests, it was hypothesised that females of species with nests >10 cm underground would be safe from lethal heat. Whereas females with shallow or above-ground nests would be vulnerable. It was also hypothesised that fire would kill proportionately more males, as they typically sleep above ground. 3. Adult bees were present at all burned sample sites 14 and 21 days after the fire started, Many females were observed transporting pollen, indicative of active nest provisioning. Among the guild of bees surveyed at wild sunflowers (the only surviving flowering plant), fewer species were active within the burn. Guild composition was significantly altered, particularly by loss or depletion of several (but not all) sunflower specialists.

In the present work we analyze social communication processes used by V. germanica when exploiting undepleted food sources. For this purpose, we investigated the arrival pattern of wasps at a protein bait and evaluated whether a forager recruited conspecifics in three different situations: foragers were able to return to the nest (full communication), foragers were removed on arrival (communication impeded), or only one forager was allowed to return to the nest (local enhancement restricted). Results demonstrated the existence of recruitment in V. germanica, given that very different patterns of wasp arrivals and a higher frequency of wasp visits to the resource were observed when communication flow between experienced and naive foragers was allowed. Our findings showed that recruitment takes place at a distance from the food source, in addition to local enhancement. When both local enhancement and distant recruitment were occurring simultaneously, the pattern of wasp arrival was exponential. When recruitment occurred only distant from the feeder, the arrival pattern was linear, but the number of wasps arriving was twice as many as when neither communication nor local enhancement was allowed. Moreover, when return to the nest was impeded, wasp arrival at the bait was regular and constant, indicating that naive wasps forage individually and are not spatially aggregated. In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate recruitment in V. germanica at a distance from the food source by modelling wasps' arrival to a protein-based resource. In addition, the existence of correlations when communication was allowed and reflected in tandem arrivals indicates that we were not in the presence of random processes.","social learning in vespula germanica wasps: do they use collective","Vespula germanica is a social wasp that has become established"

In this study, we selected a landscape with mass-flowering tufted vetches to determine the spatial scale of waylaying effect of honey bees as well as the consequence of waylaying effect on vetch pollination service. The spatial scale of waylaying effect was determined by the strongest association between honey bee density and distance, selected from a gradient of nested circular buffers centering on apiaries in three different locations. Linear models were used to predict the influence of flower visitor densities on pollination service. For our landscape, honey bee densities were best associated with distances at spatial scales of 500 m, 1150 m, and 1400 m respectively for the three locations of apiaries. Honey bee was the only pollinator whose density displayed a positive relationship with pollination service. At the scales of effect, honey bee density and pollination service declined along the distance.

The chemical management of pests can affect non-target organisms, including honey bees. Risk assessment is a way to evaluate the cost-benefit of pesticide use to honey bees and involves understanding the exposure routes and hazards posed by each particular pesticide. The effects of insecticides on bees are intuitively recognized, but other types of pesticides can affect honey bees too. Even ""inactive"" ingredients in a pesticide formulation can pose a risk to bees. Bees encounter pesticides as they forage in the environment through direct exposure to pesticide applications, and through contaminated resources such as pollen, nectar, water, comb, and propolis. Pesticides can affect bees in myriad ways. The toxicity of pesticides is highly context-specific, challenging risk assessments. Mortality is the most commonly measured effect of pesticides on bees but sublethal effects range from developmental problems, reduced reproductive fitness, diminished overwintering capacity, and numerous behavioral issues that may not kill the bee outright, but may kill the hives. The pervasiveness of pesticides in the environment means that bees cannot avoid exposure to numerous chemicals. Selecting for bees that are adapted to agrichemical-intensive landscapes may be a short-term solution, but the dynamic evolution of chemical use may prohibit long-term tolerances. Beekeepers and farmers need to work together to create and promote reduced chemical intensive food production systems. This is the only long-term answer for the survival of honey bees and biodiversity in general. Broad scale simplification of the landscape accompanied the rise of industrial-scale food production, and a variety of agrichemicals are used to support these monoculture-based systems. Biodiversity provides substantial resistance to the proliferation of pests in a variety of ways, but this diversity is removed from our food production systems in order to maximize short-term production goals. In the absence of biotic resistance to pest proliferation, land managers rely on pesticides to replace the pest management function provided by diverse biological communities. The downside is these pesticides do not solve the causative problem that produced the pest. Within this context, pests become resistant, and more and new pesticides are required to maintain pests at low densities in a system that is designed for them to excel (i.e., the pesticide treadmill). This is the environment into which honey bees and other pollinators have been inserted, and pesticides inherent in these systems affect pollinators in complex ways. Pesticides are not intended to hurt bees or any other beneficial organisms, but they often do; estimating this harm is called risk assessment. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","predicting both obvious and obscure effects of pesticides on bees","Pesticides are a necessary component of the monoculture-based food production"

The species' compatibility system was determined by carrying out experimental self- and cross-pollinations on bagged inflorescences. Stigma receptivity and pollen viability was determined using the MTT test. • Key Results and Conclusions: Populations of O. debilis in China contain either the mid-style-length morph or the short morph, but not both.

Most animal-pollinated flowering plants offer nectar as a reward for their pollinators. Some 20 000 species, however, offer only pollen and rely on pollen-foraging bees for pollination. This creates a dilemma since pollen grains contain the male gametes and should be protected from becoming bee food. Darwin was the first to hypothesize that a 'division-of-labour' among stamens could solve this dilemma, with some stamens providing pollen as food, others providing pollen for fertilization. This hypothesis can only be tested if pollen grains from the two sets of stamens can be distinguished and their fates determined to the point of attachment on the stigma. 2. We tested Darwin's hypothesis in Melastoma malabathricum (Melastomataceae), a pollen-only flower with conspicuously differentiated stamens, an inner set that is short and yellow and an outer set that is much longer and purple with small yellow spurs. Pollen release is through terminal anther pores. Taking advantage of different exine patterns on the pollen produced by the two sets of stamens, we carried out a series of experimental manipulations to compare pollinator foraging behaviour and pollen pathways from anthers to stigmas. 3. The results demonstrate that in spite of all 10 stamens being buzzed simultaneously by the carpenter bees that pollinate M. malabathricum, pollen from the purple 'fertilization' stamens is dramatically more likely to land on stigmas than pollen from the yellow 'feeding' stamens. Removal experiments showed that the yellow 'feeding' stamens also attracted pollinators from a distance. Flowers that had their anther pores plugged received fewer buzzing bouts per visit, indicating that bees assessed the amount of pollen received per bout. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in pollen loads on stigmas of flowers that had their anthers plugged and stigmas of controls, demonstrating the efficiency of vector-assisted cross-pollination and the lack of vector-assisted self-pollination. 4. The unexpectedly precise placement of pollen grains even with buzz pollination, with a large proportion of the grains deposited out of the bees' grooming reach, helps explain the evolutionary persistence of pollen as a reward in spite of the bees' ability to assess the amount of pollen received during foraging bouts. Together, these results strongly support Darwin's division-of-labour hypothesis. © 2008 The Authors.","why two kinds of stamens in buzz-pollinated flowers? experimental support","1.

Two of these, Bombus terrestris and B. hortorum, are common in Europe whilst two, B. ruderatus and B. subterraneus, have experienced declines, and the latter is now extinct in the UK. The presence of these species in New Zealand presents an opportunity to study their ecology in a contrasting environment. Forage visits made by bumblebees in New Zealand were recorded across a season. Ninety-six percent of visits were to six non-native forage plants (Cirsium vulgare, Echium vulgare, Hypericum perforatum, Lotus corniculatus, Lupinus polyphyllus and Trifolium pratense). All but L. polyphyllus are European plant species, and three are noxious weeds in New Zealand. Several of these plants have decreased in abundance in the UK, providing a potential explanation for the declines of B. ruderatus and B. subterraneus in Britain. In contrast to studies conducted elsewhere, B. ruderatus, B. terrestris and B. hortorum did not differ in diet breadth and overlap in forage use was high, probably due to the reduced diversity of bumblebee forage plants present in New Zealand. Diel partitioning of forage use between the species was observed, with foraging activity of B. hortorum greatest in the morning and evening, B. ruderatus greatest in the middle of the day and B. terrestris intermediate between the two.

The homing ability was assessed by the catch-and-release method, the flight ability was assessed by flight mills, and the learning acquisition and short-term retention were evaluated by the proboscis extension response method. Results: When treated with 10 ppb of TMX, bees had a significantly higher average homing time, mean flight velocity, flying distance, and flying duration than the control, whereas 2.4 ppb concentration did not cause any significant effect on homing or flight ability.

In decentralized systems in which individuals use local cues to decide how to allocate their time amongst multiple tasks, a ""global"" signal detectable over large distances by all members of the group could have a profound effect on task allocation and coordination. Honeybees provide a unique opportunity to study how information transfer modulates behavior because they produce pheromones that can regulate the actions of thousands of individuals in a colony. We used electrophysiological and behavioral assays to compare the transmission modes of 2 larval pheromones to test the hypothesis that larval pheromones can act as ""global"" signals by rapidly regulating behavior throughout a colony without direct physical interactions between individuals. By studying mechanisms of pheromone transmission at the individual and colony level, we provide evidence that larval pheromones act as direct rapid and powerful regulators of behavior, even among individuals too far away from each other to use visual or tactile cues.

These signals are often visually complex with a colour pattern that contrasts between outer and central parts. The significance of this colour complexity for the pollination success of flowers of deceptive orchids has scarcely been investigated. We tested the effects of the colour patterns of the food-deceptive orchid Paphiopedilum micranthum on bumblebee visitation choices and pollination success using behavioural experiments in a community context. Using comparative phylogenetic analysis and a bee vision model, we also compared the colour patterns of P. micranthum with those of its congeners and sympatric food flowers. The probability of both long-range approach and close-up choice by bumblebees to orchids was all enhanced in communities with food flowers similar in colour pattern to the orchid. Probability of long-range approach and close-up choice was negatively correlated with colour distance between orchid and food flowers in floral outer and centre, respectively. Flowers of P. micranthum that were manipulated to reduce visual complexity had reduced male and female pollination success. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the outer floral colour of P. micranthum is apomorphic and thus likely represents an evolutionary innovation, whereas the central colour is plesiomorphic and thus likely to function in the bumblebee pollination system as an exaptation. The contrast between the inner and outer colours appears to exploit visual preferences of bumblebees acquired during foraging on local food plants with similar colour patterns.

The flowering period of R. cyanocarpum ranges from late March to middle May and a single flower can last 8-10 days in its natural habitat. Flowers generally show marked herkogamy and the protruding style encourages pollinator foraging behavior that counteracts self-pollination. Floral scents comprise mostly aliphatics (64.37%) and terpenoids (29.88%), which make the flowers attractive for several insect groups, but a peak at 430 nm in the reflectance spectrum of petals suggest selection for the attraction of bumblebees. The two Bombus species, B. festivus and B. richardsiellus, representing 90% of total recorded visits, were the only insect species that can be considered to effectively pollinate R. cyanocarpum.

Fields managed under AES for cirl buntings (low-input spring barley or permanent pasture without inputs) were contrasted with control fields under conventional management (spring barley without management restrictions and winter cereals, or grazed without management restrictions) to identify such benefits for vascular plants, butterflies, bumblebees, carabid beetles, foliar invertebrates and bats. Activity-density and species richness of carabid beetles were both higher in AES spring barley fields than in control spring barley and winter cereal fields. Forb cover and abundance of butterflies and bumblebees were higher in AES spring barley fields than in winter cereals, but did not differ between AES and control spring barley. No difference was observed in plant species richness between any of the arable field types. Plant species richness and butterfly abundance were higher in AES pasture fields than in controls. Abundance, activity-density and/or species richness of other taxa did not differ between AES and control pastures. Benefits observed in AES spring barley fields arise from management specific to AES agreements, and also, we suggest, from the maintenance of spring-sown barley in the landscape. Benefits in AES pasture fields are ascribed to the absence of fertiliser and pesticide inputs, and reductions in stocking arising from this; there is also likely to have been some pre-selection for older pastures to be entered into AES management agreements. Agri-environment measures for cirl buntings have benefits for a range of taxa beyond the target species, and therefore, largely through reduction of management intensity and maintenance of land-use diversity, improve the overall biodiversity of the farmed landscape where they are present.","effects of agri-environment management for cirl buntings on other biodiversity","Agri-environment scheme (AES) management has increased populations of cirl buntings"

Three application timings, autumn (postbloom), spring (prebloom), and summer (early postbloom), were evaluated to see if taking advantage of differences in the neonicotinoids' systemic mobility and persistence might enable pest control while minimizing transference into nectar.

However, there have been few comparisons of the effectiveness of different types of field-margin pollinator habitat in maintaining bee diversity and pollination of the focal crops. We compared wild bee abundance, species richness and community composition between strawberry crops bordered by hedgerows, and those bordered by larger expanses of natural land (forests). Strawberry is an ideal crop in which to investigate pollinator export from field margins as the rows are covered with straw, which reduces habitat for ground-nesting bees within the crop; thus, most wild pollinators need to enter the crop from the margins. We sampled bees in six strawberry fields with hedgerow margins and six strawberry fields with forested margins of at least 200 m in length, using a paired design. We examined strawberry pollen deposition at regular intervals into the fields, and the magnitude of pollinator export from the field margins towards the centre of the crops. We found that bees as a group were no more species-rich or abundant in crops bordered by forests than in crops bordered by hedgerows, although large-bodied bees were more abundant in the former than the latter. Regardless of field-margin type, we found that small wild bee abundance declined significantly from the edge to the centre of the crop, but honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) and large-bodied bee abundance did not. Strawberry pollen deposition also did not decline with distance into the crop. Although previous work indicates that small wild bees are more effective (yield-increasing) pollinators of strawberry on a per-visit basis, their limited foraging ranges suggest they may only pollinate areas near the crop margins, given typical field sizes in our area. © 2020 Gesellschaft für Ökologie","small wild bee abundance declines with distance into strawberry crops","The preservation of pollinator habitat on croplands in the form"

In cropping environments, especially monoculture systems, pollinators that travel between plants or rows may increase cross-pollination and consequently crop yield. However, the most commonly utilized crop pollinator, Apis mellifera L., tends to forage consecutively on nearest-neighbouring plants within rows. The level of cross-pollination can be further restricted in crops that are propagated by cloning. When a clonal variety is planted over large areas, the potential for outcrossed pollen deposition could be limited, regardless of pollinator flight distances. To investigate how pollinator movement and varietal diversity interact to affect crop pollination, we conducted an experiment with wild and honey bees in single- and multiple-variety strawberry fields. We hypothesized that the amount of cross-pollination provided by wild bees in multiple-variety strawberry fields would be greater than in single-variety fields, and greater than that provided by honey bees in either field type. We found that, indeed, flowers visited by wild bees produced larger strawberries than those visited by honey bees in multiple-variety plots, but only in the more self-incompatible of the two strawberry varieties tested. Strawberries resulting from honey bee pollination were of similar size regardless of the number of varieties planted in the field. Our results show that certain multiple-variety strawberry fields can benefit from the irregular foraging patterns of some solitary bee species, leading to increased cross-pollination and crop yield.

Bees are modeled as finite-state machines, and there can be hundreds of them in the colony. They leave the hive to search for food sources (flowers) and return to communicate their direction and distance to other bees. In order to check the value of the waggle dance, it can be turned on or off in the artificial bee population. We find that the communication is indeed valuable to helping the bees locate food more quickly, and especially when it is not plentiful. We find that the component of direction is more useful to the bees than distance, although honeybees use both in real life.

Specimens from five locations in Belgium were genotyped at 16 microsatellite loci, comparing historical specimens (1913-1915) with recent ones (2013-2015). Surprisingly, our results showed temporal stability of genetic diversity in the restricted species.

The difference in genetic diversity between species was thus already present before the alleged recent drivers of bumblebee decline could have acted (from the 1950's).

The observed difference might be explained by abundance differences, with declining bumblebee species having lower genetic diversity levels simply due to their lower local species abundances. However, whether this holds true is not known. Here, we investigated whether bumblebee local abundances determines population genetic diversity levels. Therefore, local species abundances were measured for bumblebee species at four locations in Belgium and two locations in Estonia during bumblebee foraging years 2013-2017. These locations and countries were chosen to ensure the greatest possible variance in both local abundances and population trends for these species. Hence, genetic diversity levels were obtained for seven species by genotyping collected specimens with 16 microsatellites. Our results showed that the observed patterns in genetic diversity did not depend on local species abundance. So, although declining bumblebee species can become locally abundant, they will still show lower genetic diversity levels than stable species. This result implies that measuring bumblebees' local abundance cannot be used to directly determine the health status of a population. Furthermore, this result has also major impact on future conservation strategies as increasing the genetic diversity levels of declining species will be very difficult, and habitat quality should be high to maintain their populations, otherwise these species are doomed to disappear first.","level of genetic diversity in european bumblebees is not determined","Bumblebee species with declining population trends tend to show lower"

Our study describes the consequences of edge creation over two successive stages in the life cycle of a hemi-parasitic mistletoe (Tristerix corymbosus), which determine its reproductive success, in temperate austral forests. We assessed how flower production and pollinator visits change with distance to the nearest forest edge and how these changes affect fruit set, fruit and seed size, and fruit removal by seed dispersers. Edge effects were dominated by fruit removal, which increased with the distance to the edge, height in the canopy and fruit availability. As a result, plant reproduction (in terms of seeds produced and fruits removed, which putatively leads to higher seed dispersal) decreased strongly near to forest edges. In contrast, visitation rates of the main pollinator (the hummingbird) were unaffected by edges, and their strong effects on fruit set (including the alleviation of quality pollen limitation arising in the forest interior) might be mitigating the decrease in bumblebee visitation near to forest edges. Synthesis. Our study shows clearly how secondary and tertiary responses to forest edges acted in opposite directions (increasing or decreasing plant reproductive performance), highlighting the need to study several successive processes that impact upon plant fitness under disturbance. Preserving relatively large patches of old-growth forest with low perimeter/area ratios would be key to the habitat requirements of the main disperser and pollinator and thus for mistletoe reproductive performance. © 2013 The Authors.

The inclination of the ground where plants grow, which has been little studied, could be one such factor. There may be differences in foraging performance when visiting flowers on horizontal planes compared with flowers on inclines planes. And if this is the case, pollinators may have a preference for horizontal or inclined planes. To test these possibilities, a series of laboratory experiments with bumble bees and arrays of artificial flowers were conducted. In the first experiment, bees were presented with a pair of floral arrays, one on a horizontal plane and one sloping. The bees preferred visiting flowers on the horizontal array. In the second experiment, bees were allowed to forage on a flower array tilted at various angles ranging from 0 degrees (horizontal) to 90 degrees (vertical). It was found that their foraging performance decreased with increasing angles, showing a 9.1% reduction from 0 degrees to 90 degrees arrays. This reduction was caused by an increased travel time between flowers, when moving upslope or downslope. These results suggest that plants growing on steep slopes may be less preferred by pollinators. Future studies are needed to clarify how slopes affect pollinator behaviour in field conditions and the ecological influences on plant reproduction.","bumble bee preference for flowers arranged on a horizontal plane","Determining factors affecting pollinator visitation is the key to understanding"

Molecular studies have estimated that bumblebee colonies can be established many kilometers from their queens’ natal nest site. However, little is known about when and how queens disperse during their lifespan. One possible life stage when dispersal may occur, is directly after emerging from hibernation. Here, harmonic radar tracking of artificially over-wintered Bombus terrestris queens shows that they spend most of their time resting on the ground with intermittent very short flights (duration and distance). We corroborate these behaviors with observations of wild queen bees, which show similar prolonged resting periods between short flights, indicating that the behavior of our radar-monitored bees was not due to the attachment of transponders nor an artifact of the bees being commercially reared. Radar-monitored flights were not continuously directed away from the origin, suggesting that bees were not intentionally trying to disperse from their artificial emergence site. Flights did not loop back to the origin suggesting bees were not trying to remember or get back to the original release site. Most individuals dispersed from the range of the harmonic radar within less than two days and did not return. Flight directions were not different from a uniform distribution and flight lengths followed an exponential distribution, both suggesting random dispersal. A random walk model based on our observed data estimates a positive net dispersal from the origin over many flights, indicating a biased random dispersal, and estimates the net displacement of queens to be within the range of those estimated in genetic studies. We suggest that a distinct post-hibernation life history stage consisting mostly of rest with intermittent short flights and infrequent foraging fulfils the dual purpose of ovary development and dispersal prior to nest searching. © 2019, The Author(s).","harmonic radar tracking reveals random dispersal pattern of bumblebee (bombus","The dispersal of animals from their birth place has profound"

Wild bees that nest or forage within agroecosystems may be exposed to numerous pesticides applied throughout their life cycles, with potential additive or synergistic effects. In pollinator-dependent crops, pesticides may reduce bee populations, creating trade-offs between pest management and crop pollination. In this three-year study, we examined the effects of pesticides on the abundance and species richness of wild bees within apple orchards of southern Wisconsin. We additionally deployed colonies of Bombus impatiens, a native and common species, in order to relate colony performance to orchard pesticide use. Utilizing grower spray records, we developed “toxicity scores” as a continuous index of pesticide use for each orchard, a measure that incorporated each pesticide’s relative toxicity to bees, its residual activity, and its application rate. While there was no relationship between total wild bee abundance and species richness with toxicity scores, there was a significant, negative effect on sweat bees, Lasioglossum spp. Many of these sweat bees are small-bodied, have short foraging ranges, are social, and have long foraging periods, all traits that could increase bee exposure or sensitivity to orchard pesticides. In addition, sentinel bumble bee colonies at orchards with high toxicity scores produced fewer, and smaller, workers. Bumble bees may also have a greater sensitivity and exposure to orchard pesticides due to their sociality and long foraging periods. Our results demonstrate that certain bee taxa may have a higher exposure or sensitivity to on-farm pesticide applications, and could therefore be vulnerable in agroecosystems. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA).","pesticide use within a pollinator-dependent crop has negative effects on","Pesticides are implicated in current bee declines.

When displaced to places far from their nests, thus expected to be unfamiliar, only a third returned on the day of release showing nest-ward orientation; others oriented randomly and either returned on subsequent days or never. When confined within mosquito-net tents since eclosion and later released to places close to their nests (but unfamiliar), even fed wasps oriented randomly, and only older wasps returned, taking longer time. Thus, contrary to insects inhabiting less-featured landscapes, R. marginata foragers appear to have thorough familiarity with their foraging grounds that enables them to orient and home efficiently after passive displacement. Their initial orientation is, however, determined by an interaction of the information acquired from surrounding landscape and their physiological motivation. With age, they develop skills to home from unfamiliar places.

Iridaceae and Geraniaceae, with intense purple to crimson flowers and extremely long and slender perianth tubes, is pollinated exclusively by two long-tongued flies of the family Nemestrinidae. The two species of flies, Prosoeca peringueyi and P. sp. nov., are active in the late winter and spring, have large bodies, mouthparts 20-50 mm long, and forage for nectar while bovering. Plants pollinated by these two flies share a suite of convergent floral characteristics, including a straight or slightly curved floral tube at least 20 mm and up to 70 mm long, relatively short petals or tepals colored predominantly dark blue- or red-purple with pale nectar guides, and anthers and stigmas exserted from the tube and usually unilateral in orientation. With one exception, the flowers of all species secrete large amounts of nectar of relatively constant total sugar concentration, mostly 24-29%, and high sucrose: hexose ratio. Most members of the guild have odorless flowers. The long floral tube makes nectar unavailable to most insects, including a variety of bees, wasps, and other flies that pollinate plant which co-occur with members of the long-tubed flower guild. The two Prosoeca species have monthparts long enough to forage effectively on these long-tubed flowers, and they are also effective pollinators because pollen adheres to their bodies and is transported from flower to flower. The flies visit a wide range of plants but are effective pollinators only of those with tube lengths greater that their proboscis lengths. We have identified four mutually exclusive sites of pollen deposition on the insects' bodies; when two or more members of the guild co-occur, each species typically utilizes a different pollen deposition site. This suggests that pollen contamination is detrimental to reproductive success. Differential pollen deposition sites may have evolved in response to selection for reduced pollen contamination. Since 27 of the 28 plant species appear to depend exclusively on these two species of Prosoeca for pollination, these flies must be considered keystone species in the ecosystems where they occur.","the prosoeca peringueyi (diptera: nemestrinidae) pollination guild in southern africa:","A guild of 28 winter- and spring-flowering species of two"

In eusocial species, P450 expression varies with anatomy and age-related behaviour. Adult honeybees (Apis mellifera) possess appendages differentially equipped for chemoreception; antennae and prothoracic and mesothoracic legs assess food and pheromone signals whereas metathoracic legs transport pollen over long distances. Newly eclosed bees and nurses remain in the hive and neither gather nor process food, whereas foragers collect pollen and nectar, thereby encountering phytochemicals. To understand the functions of cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily G, polypeptide 11 (CYP4G11) in the honeybee genome, we compared its expression relative to worker age and task to expression of cytochrome P450, family 9, subfamily Q, polypeptides (CYP9Qs) known to metabolize xenobiotics. That CYP4G11 is highly expressed in forager antennae and legs, with highest expression in prothoracic and mesothoracic legs, is consistent with chemosensory perception, whereas weak expression of CYP4G11 in nurses suggests that it may process primarily exogenous rather than endogenous chemical signals. By contrast, and consistent with xenobiotic detoxification, the three CYP9Q transcripts were almost undetectable in newly eclosed workers and highest in foragers, with maximal expression in the metathoracic legs that closely contact pollen phytochemicals.

Several parasite species are known to infect bumblebees, an important group of pollinators. Task allocation within bumblebee colonies can also cause differences in behaviour. Thus, task allocation may lead to context-dependent impacts of parasites on host behaviour. This study uses Bombus terrestris and its gut trypanosome Crithidia bombi, to investigate the effects of parasitism, task allocation (foraging or nest-work) and their interactions, on olfactory learning. Prior to undergoing the olfactory learning task, bees were orally infected with a field-realistic dose of C. bombi, and observed to determine task allocation. Parasitism did not significantly affect olfactory learning, but task allocation did, with foragers being significantly more likely to learn than nest bees. There was no significant interaction between parasitism and task. These results suggest that C. bombi is unlikely to affect pollination services via changes in olfactory learning of its host if bees are under no environmental or nutritional stress. However, wild and commercial colonies are likely to face such stressors. Future studies in the field are needed to extrapolate our results to real world effects.","bumblebee olfactory learning affected by task allocation but not by","Parasites can induce behavioural changes in their host organisms.

We studied the genetic structure of four natural populations of S. lycocarpum separated by 19 to 128 km, including individuals located along dirt roads that interlink three of the populations.

Whether compensation is possible will depend on functional diversity in the wild bee community and on the distribution of habitat and resources within the landscape surrounding an orchard that affect wild bee abundance. We studied pollination services and bee functional diversity in 20 apple orchards in southern Quebec, Canada. We evaluated pollinator efficacy by studying: apple visitation rates, approach (front or side-working), body size, foraging type (pollen or nectar foraging), sociality, temporal and climatic activity patterns, and pollen carrying habit. Pollination services were measured as apple fruit set and seed set. A distance-based measure of functional diversity, calibrated with bee traits and weighted by species relative abundance in the wild bee community, was used to model pollination services. We correlated the landscape composition and configuration of surrounding natural (forest) and semi-natural (meadow) habitats with bee diversity and pollination services. The incidence of fruit set and seed set in orchards increased with bee functional diversity. Complementarity between managed versus unmanaged bees in traits associated with foraging and resource use drove this relationship. Seed set was also negatively correlated with both the mean distance from surrounding meadows and the total area of surrounding orchards. Bee functional diversity was positively associated with surrounding meadow and forest area. These two land classes complement each other in their seasonal provision of foraging resources for bees.

We determined whether foraging is improved in part because patriline diversity generates more responsive populations of scouting foragers. Scouts search for new food sources and advertise them with waggle dances to inform other foragers about unexploited discoveries. We moved multiple-patriline and single-patriline colonies to unfamiliar locations so that colonies relied heavily on successful scouts to initiate recruitment and then compared the development of foraging effort between the two types of colonies. More waggle dance signals were produced during the incipient stages of foraging in multiple-patriline colonies compared to single-patriline colonies because scouts reported food discoveries with longer dances. Scouts also returned to multiple-patriline colonies at rates that were two thirds higher than those of single-patriline colonies, although return rates for general forager populations were not significantly different between colony types. The distance of reported food sources from hives increased with time for all colonies, but by the end of their first day in an unfamiliar environment, maximal foraging reach was greater if colonies had multiple patrilines. Most scouts in multiple-patriline colonies came from a minority of scout-rich patrilines that were generally not those from which general forager populations were derived; the presence of such scout-rich patrilines was correlated with the extent of recruitment signaling in colonies. We show how a honeybee colony's scouting effort is (and is not) enhanced when extremely polyandrous queens produce genetically diverse colonies. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","does a polyandrous honeybee queen improve through patriline diversity the","Recent studies indicate that the foraging success of a honeybee"

Very few studies have investigated the effects of nectar robbing on the behaviour of legitimate pollinators so far. Such behavioural changes may lead to the reduction of geitonogamy or to increased pollen movement. We simulated nectar robbing in experimental sites as well as in natural populations of Aconitum napellus ssp. lusitanicum, a rare plant pollinated by long-tongued bumblebees. In an experimental setup, we removed the nectaries of 40 % of the flowers, which is similar to rates of robbing observed in wild populations. Patches of plants with experimentally robbed flowers were compared with control patches containing plants with untreated flowers. We observed pollinator behaviour, mimicked male reproductive success (pollen dispersal) using fluorescent dye, and measured female reproductive success (seed set). The main legitimate visitors were bumblebees while honeybees were often observed robbing nectar. They did so by ""base working"", i.e. sliding between tepals. Bumblebees tended to visit fewer flowers per plant and spent less time per single flower when these had been experimentally robbed. This change in behaviour consequently increased the proportion of flowers visited by bumblebees in patches with robbed flowers. Fluorescent dye mimicking pollen flow was dispersed larger distances after pollinators had visited patches with robbed flowers compared to control patches. Average seed set per plant was not affected by nectar robbing. Our results demonstrated that A. napellus does not suffer from nectar robbery but may rather benefit via improved pollen dispersal and thus, male reproductive success. Knowledge on such combined effects of behavioural changes of pollinators due to nectar robbery is important to understand the evolutionary significance of exploiters of such mutualistic relationships between plants and their pollinators. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","nectar robbing improves male reproductive success of the endangered aconitum","Nectar robbery is usually thought to impact negatively on the"

To date, the impact of plant population size on pollen collection by pollinators has not yet been investigated. From 2008 to 2010, we monitored nine bumble bee species (Bombus campestris, Bombus hortorum s.l., Bombus hypnorum, Bombus lapidarius, Bombus pascuorum, Bombus pratorum, Bombus soroensis, Bombus terrestris s.l., Bombus vestalis s.l.) on Vaccinium uliginosum (Ericaceae) in up to nine populations in Belgium ranging in size from 80 m 2 to over 3.1 ha. Bumble bee abundance declined with decreasing plant population size, and especially the proportion of individuals of large bumble bee species diminished in smaller populations. The most remarkable and novel observation was that bumble bees seemed to switch foraging behaviour according to population size: while they collected both pollen and nectar in large populations, they largely neglected pollen collection in small populations. This pattern was due to large bumble bee species, which seem thus to be more likely to suffer from pollen shortages in smaller habitat fragments. Comparing pollen loads of bumble bees we found that fidelity to V. uliginosum pollen did not depend on plant population size but rather on the extent shrub cover and/or openness of the site. Bumble bees collected pollen only from three plant species (V. uliginosum, Sorbus aucuparia and Cytisus scoparius). We also did not discover any pollination limitation of V. uliginosum in small populations. We conclude that habitat fragmentation might not immediately threaten the pollination of V. uliginosum, nevertheless, it provides important nectar and pollen resources for bumble bees and declining populations of this plant could have negative effects for its pollinators. The finding that large bumble bee species abandon pollen collection when plant populations become small is of interest when considering plant and bumble bee conservation.","the abundance and pollen foraging behaviour of bumble bees in","Habitat fragmentation can have severe effects on plant pollinator interactions,"

However, in the ant Ectatomma ruidum, specialized thieves often circumvent detection by conspecific non-nestmates, and those detected are peacefully expelled. Colonies can gather food through typical foraging (opportunistically tracking prey or nutrients in the home range) or by robbing (entering a conspecific nest, waiting for, and then removing a newly arrived food item carried in by a forager). Here, we conducted behavioural assays to determine whether robbers (or 'thieves'), carrying purloined food, manifest behaviours that minimize the probability of detection relative to nonthieving individuals. We found several lines of evidence that individuals carrying stolen food behave distinctly from normal nonthieving foragers. When returning to their home nest with a stolen food item, thieves had fewer encounters with conspecifics, were more likely to pause during movement, and were more likely to release food when grasped. Thieves walked faster while travelling in the victim's home range, compared to their own home range. When experimentally perturbed, thieves were more likely to reverse their direction of movement, while normal foragers continued moving in the same direction. Because the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition, as well as the C:N ratio, was the same for both thieves and nonthieves, we conclude that both groups were accessing the same food sources, using different behaviours to repartition a common resource. We conclude that, although thieves are morphologically indistinguishable from nonthieving foragers, their food retrieval behaviours are distinct in a manner that reduces the probability of detection and aggressive interactions with other conspecifics. We propose that thieves are a distinct caste of forager in E. ruidum. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This is in spite of the fact that the availability of natural habitat has been identified as a critical factor influencing the diversity and abundance of beneficial crop insects, including native pollinators. We examined the effect of the type of field edge habitat (forested or deforested) on the abundance and diversity of bee species foraging in 15 managed lowbush blueberry fields in the vicinity of St. Stephens, New Brunswick, Canada. Additionally, we tested whether edge habitat type was associated with differences in pollen limitation, fruit set, and seed set of adjacent lowbush blueberry plants. Finally, we used GIS to determine the influence of larger scale land use patterns on the pollinator community and crop success of individual fields. Our forested field edges were distinguished as having lower light availability, greater canopy cover, and a greater bee nesting habitat index than deforested edges. Forested edges also had a greater diversity of bees. In particular, they supported more species of cleptoparasitic bees than deforested edges. Meanwhile, the abundance of non-parasitic (i.e., pollen-seeking) bees was greater along deforested edges. Blueberry plants along deforested edges tended to have more flowers, higher fruit set and marginally higher seed set than plants along forested edges. We found no difference in pollen limitation between edge types, suggesting that differences in fruit set were due to resource limitation. At the landscape level, we found no association among the amount of forest cover surrounding a field and the abundance or diversity of pollinators. However, on the forested edges of fields, we did find a positive correlation between the amount of forest surrounding a field and the abundance of pollinators. Our finding that forested edges had greater nesting habitat index and higher diversity of bees together suggest that the maintenance of areas of natural habitat within agricultural ecosystems helps to support greater pollinator diversity.

Osmia cornifrons eggs survived at 13, 21, and 29 degrees C, but were unable to survive at other temperatures. Larvae survived at 21 and 29 degrees C, with 88.5 and 45.5% survival, respectively. The thermal window for the development of egg and 1st instar was 17.99 degrees C, and for 2nd instar to prepupa was 12.58 degrees C. Nearly all validation data fell within the 95% prediction interval, indicating that the models accurately represented the thermal biology of O. cornifrons in field. The narrow thermal window found in this study for O. cornifrons larval development indicates that O. cornifrons is sensitive to temperature change during this life history stage. Implications of the thermal requirements of O. cornifrons for propagation and management are discussed.","thermal biology of osmia cornifrons (hymenoptera: megachilidae) eggs and larvae","Temperature plays an important role in the growth and development"

Colonies had a density of 4.2/km2 but exhibited considerable spatial clumping.

Nests occurred predominantly in wooden cavities, particularly in abandoned woodpecker nests in dead palm trees. Nest cavities had a volume of ≃33 liters and south-facing, top-located entrances. Colonies constructed ≃6,000 cm2 of comb, devoted the majority of comb area to worker brood production, stored relatively little food, and allocated ≃8% of comb area to drone rearing. A comparison of the A. m. scutellata colonies in the Okavango with neotropical African colonies throughout Central and South America revealed that the neotropical colonies were more likely to construct exposed comb nests and less likely to occupy wooden cavities. However, no differences were found between the Okavango and neotropical colonies in nest density, cavity volume, total comb area, or the proportions of comb devoted to worker brood production, food storage or drone rearing. Thus, the aspects of nesting biology examined appear to have remained largely unchanged from the ancestral African condition during the colonization of Central and South America.","spatial distribution and nesting biology of colonies of the african","The spatial distribution and nesting biology were examined for naturally"

This study investigated Narcissus longispathus, a self-compatible bee-pollinated species with wide variation in anther-stigma separation (herkogamy), to determine the relationship between variation in this floral trait and the relative amounts of cross- and self-fertilization. • Methods: Anther-stigma separation was measured in the field in six populations of N. longispathus from south-eastern Spain. Variation in herkogamy during the life of individual flowers was also quantified. Multilocus outcrossing rates were estimated from plants differing in herkogamy using allozyme markers. • Key Results: Anther-stigma separation varied considerably among flowers within the six populations studied (range = 1-10 mm). This variation was nearly one order of magnitude larger than the slight, statistically non-significant developmental variation during the lifespan of individual flowers. Estimates of multilocus outcrossing rate for different herkogamy classes (tm range = 0.49-0.76) failed to reveal a monotonic increase with increasing herkogamy. • Conclusions: It is suggested that the lack of a positive relationship between herkogamy and outcrossing rate, a result that has not been previously documented for other species, could be mostly related to details of the foraging behaviour of pollinators. © The Author 2005.

Melittidae were not included although they are important pollinators in South Africa where they comprise an especially rich and morphologically diverse fauna. We measured intertegular distance (correlated with body size) and proboscis length of 179 specimens of 11 species from three genera of Melittidae.

AIC model selection was used to establish which factors provide the best estimate of proboscis length. We explored a hypothesis that has been proposed in the literature, but which has not been tested, whereby body and range sizes of bees are correlated with rainfall regions. We tested this by using body size measurements of 2109 museum specimens from 56 species of Melittidae and applied the model coefficients to estimate proboscis length and foraging distance.

The area contained a great number of nests. A female was observed beginning nest construction, while other females in the area were apparently more advanced in their work. The activity period of the species, female foraging time, and time of female activity inside the nest were established. Several nests were excavated but cells were not found, perhaps reflecting the early stage of construction of those nests. The precise association of L. sabulosus with a particular plant was not established, but pollen load analysis indicates the species may be oligolectic. Males were observed behaving territorially. A male's territory seemed to correspond with the presence of a stone. Males behaved aggressively when other males approached the area.

Few studies have tested predictions about the distribution of genetic variation among co-occurring endemic plants species. We describe genetic variation and its relationship to life history traits for seven narrowly endemic, federally endangered Florida scrub species: Dicerandra christmanii, D. frutescens, Eryngium cuneifolium, Hypericum cumulicola, Liatris ohlingerae, Nolina brittoniana, Warea carteri. These species have varying life histories, degrees of habitat specialization, and geographic distributions. Measures of genetic (allozyme) diversity (mean number of alleles/locus, percentage of loci polymorphic and expected heterozygosity) varied among species. However, genetic variation was generally lower than published means for plants and also generally lower for means for comparable groups (endemics, short-lived herbs, species with mixed mating systems, species with gravity dispersed seeds). The chief exception was L. ohlingerae, which had relatively high genetic variation. All three measures of genetic variation produced the same ranking among species: L. ohlingerae &gt; D. christmanii &gt; N. brittoniana &gt; E. cuneifolium &gt; D. frutescens &gt; W. carteri &gt; H. cumulicola. For six of these species, we compared genetic variation with rankings of eight life history factors. Genetic variation was highest in long-lived, demographically stable, outcrossing species with long pollinator dispersal distances. Attributes such as median population size, habitat specificity, geographic range, and estimated primary seed dispersal distances were not related to rankings for genetic variation. The studied species varied widely in genetic differentiation among populations (0.02 &lt; FST &lt; 0.72). The most differentiated species, H. cumulicola, is pollinated by specialized bees that may move short distances, therefore limiting gene flow among isolated patches. These comparisons emphasize that co-occurring narrowly endemic species can have a diversity of genetic patterns and that many factors can influence the amount and distribution of genetic variation. Further loss of genetic variation due to habitat loss and fragmentation will impact the genetic variation of these species differently. A single conservation strategy for this suite of species is therefore unlikely to achieve genetic conservation goals.","comparative genetics of seven plants endemic to florida's lake wales","Genetic variation is often low in narrowly endemic species, and"

Honeybees are positively phototactic when they leave a feeding place and start to fly back to the hive. The strength of this natural phototactic response in individually marked bees was measured without interfering with their foraging behaviour. 2. Absolute sensitivity of this phototactic response to a point light source is in the range of 8.3 · 107 quanta s-1 for 537 nm. This corresponds to about 5 absorbed quanta in 28 green receptors over the integration time of 60 ms. 3. We conclude that the properties of the monopolar cells or higher order visual interneurons rather than those of the photoreceptors control the intensity dependence of the response because the slopes (n) of the response intensity functions (R/log I) are steep (n: 1.0-2.65) and wavelength dependent. Blue light (439 nm) causes the steepest function. 4. The effect of residual light adaptation on the R/log I-function and the spectral sensitivity (S(λ)) is negligible under the experimental conditions chosen, since the time course of dark adaptation is fast (τ≦1 min). 5. The blue and green receptors contribute about equally to the S(λ) of this natural phototactic response, the UV receptors somewhat less (Fig. 5). 6. Colour mixing experiments, used to test colour vision in phototaxis, reveal no significant deviation from a simple linear summation of the quantal fluxes, irrespective of the spectral mixture used. We conclude, therefore, that under the experimental conditions colour vision is very unlikely to play a role in the phototactic behaviour of the honeybee. 7.

The cultivation of lulo outside of its native range, for example in European glasshouses, requires the presence of efficient pollinators to enable high fruit set and yield. Until now, the suitability of Bombus terrestris L., native to Europe and commonly used in agriculture, has been untested for this purpose. In this study, the pollen-collecting behaviour of B. terrestris when visiting lulo flowers was investigated. It was shown that B. terrestris adopted the lulo as a pollen source, and on average visited three flowers per minute, had five buzzing events per stay and foraged for 15 s on a single flower, independently of the previous number of visits and level of bruising to the anthers. The pollination efficiency of five different treatments was evaluated: (i) exclusion of bees, (ii) single and (iii) multiple visits of B. terrestris, (iv) self- and (v) cross-pollination by hand. The results clearly demonstrated that, for fruit set, pollination is crucial. It was also found that lulo flowers can be successfully self-pollinated, but give 25% fewer fruit set compared with pollination via multiple bumblebee visits, or cross-pollination by hand. Fruit set, seed set and fruit size were as high with pollination by B. terrestris as with cross-pollination by hand, indicating that this bumblebee is an appropriate pollinator for lulo. However, B. terrestris was conspicuously less effective when a flower was visited only once. Therefore, when growing lulos commercially, multiple bumblebee visits should be encouraged, but it is likely that the behaviour of B. terrestris would ensure this anyway.

Managing agricultural landscapes through agri-environment schemes (AES) supports biodiversity and could counteract pollinator population declines. We investigated whether alterations to current AES grassland mowing regimes would increase the abundance and species richness of wild bees and hoverflies. Furthermore, we investigated the response of different nesting and feeding guilds of wild bees and hoverfiies, respectively, to these regimes. The three experimental mowing regimes were: (i) first cut not before 15 June, before the beginning of summer (Swiss AES management, control meadows); (ii) first cut delayed until 15 July (delayed meadows); (iii) as for control meadows but leaving 10-20% uncut as a refuge (refuge meadows). The rationale behind the delayed and refuge mowing regimes was extending the availability of floral resources for pollinators, while also providing refugia for species that may be directly impacted by mowing. Hoverflies and wild bees were collected in 2014 and 2015, respectively, using pan-trapping and sweep-netting, once before and once after the first cut. The two collecting methods showed contrasting results. While there was no difference in the abundance or richness of wild bees between the meadows when using pan traps, following the first cut, sweep-netting resulted in a higher abundance and richness of wild bees in delayed and refuge meadows compared to control meadows. Pan-trapping detected a higher abundance of hoverflies in delayed compared to refuge meadows, whereas sweep-netting detected a higher abundance in delayed and refuge compared to control meadows, after the first cut. Saprophagous hoverflies were more abundant in the control and delayed than refuge meadows following the first cut, when sampled with pan traps. Predatory hoverfiies were more abundant and species rich in delayed and refuge compared to control meadows following the first cut, when sampled by sweep netting. Our study demonstrates that simple alterations to a common AES grassland mowing regime can enhance populations of pollinators and natural enemies of crop pests.

Thus, distinguishing the effects of clonal versus sexual individuals in population genetic analyses could provide important insights for evolutionary biology and conservation. To investigate the effects of clonal spread on the fine-scale spatial genetic structure within plant populations, Hosta jonesii (Liliaceae), an endemic species to Korea, was chosen as a study species. • Methods: Using allozymes as genetic markers, spatial autocorrelation analysis of ramets and of genets was conducted to quantify the spatial scale of clonal spread and genotype distribution in two populations of H. jonesii. • Key Results: Join-count statistics revealed that most clones are significantly aggregated at <3-m interplant distance. Spatial autocorrelation analysis of all individuals resulted in significantly higher Moran's I values at 0-3-m interplant distance than analyses of population samples in which clones were excluded. However, significant fine-scale genetic structure was still observed when clones were excluded. • Conclusions: These results suggest that clones enhance the magnitude of spatial autocorrelation due to localized clonal spread. The significant fine-scale genetic structure detected in samples excluding clones is consistent with the biological and ecological traits exhibited by H. jonesii including bee pollination and limited seed dispersal. For conservation purposes, genetic diversity would be maximized in local populations of H. jonesii by collecting or preserving individuals that are spaced at least 5 m apart. © The Author 2005.

Among them, the harmonic radar described in (Ecology and Evolution, 6, 2016 and 2170) already proved to be a quite effective way to follow the hornets to their nests; it is in fact capable of tracking the flying trajectory of these insects, once equipped with a small transponder, in their natural environment. The aforementioned harmonic radar was upgraded after a period of intense experimentation; the capture of the hornets was enhanced as well, and other improvements were adopted in the mounting procedure of the transponder. Thanks to these upgrades, the flying capabilities of the hornets were not reduced and a huge collection of data was recorded. The main upgrade to the radar was the adoption of the vertical polarization of the radiated field, with the consequent redesign and manufacturing of the antennas and the different mounting of the transceiver on the insect. The installation of the radar on a telescopic tower drastically improved the maneuverability of the system and the capability to follow the insects’ preferential flying directions. Eventually, the system was able to produce much more continuous traces with a clear indication of the most probable position of the nest.

Seed set in the populations varied from 3 to 40% of the ovules produced, indicating that the reproductive ability of individuals will vary substantially between sites and, hence, that the populations differ in their viability. Seed set was not significantly correlated with population size, and including other enviromental variables in the model did not improve the ability to predict seed set (stepwise multiple regression; size and degree of isolation of the habitat, species-richness of the vegetation, frequency of bumblebee visits).

The effects of spinosad to honeybees have been extensively researched. Testing has been performed under a variety of conditions in a range of countries globally. Studies to determine the acute toxicity of spinosad under laboratory conditions were conducted to generate LD50 or LC50 values for oral and contact routes of administration. These demonstrated that spinosad was highly toxic to worker honeybees under worst case laboratory conditions. Residue tests conducted under laboratory conditions using worker honeybees exposed to treated foliage, indicated that dry product residues were harmless. Therefore, the effects seen in laboratory acute toxicity tests did not translate to a more realistic exposure scenario. Semi-field cage studies demonstrated that spinosad was safe to bees when applied to flowering crops during periods of low bee activity. At high application rates evidence for repellence was seen and in one study some minor effects were noted on brood survival. In field studies dry residues of spinosad were safe to foraging worker honeybees, with no adverse effects seen on mortality, foraging behaviour, brood or queen. It can be concluded that spinosad, when used according to the approved product label recommendations, would be safe to foraging worker bees, queen and brood and may be safely used in flowering crops if applications are made during periods of low bee activity.","the effects of spinosad, a naturally derived insect control agent","Spinosad is a novel insect control agent derived by fermentation"

However, studies investigating whether oligolectic bees recognize distinct host plants by using shared floral cues are scarce. In the present study, we investigated in a comparative approach the visual and olfactory floral cues of six Campanula species, of which only Campanula lactiflora has never been reported as a pollen source of the oligolectic bee Ch. rapunculi. We hypothesized that the flowers of Campanula species visited by Ch. rapunculi share visual (i.e. color) and/or olfactory cues (scents) that give them a host-specific signature. To test this hypothesis, floral color and scent were studied by spectrophotometric and chemical analyses, respectively. Additionally, we performed bioassays within a flight cage to test the innate color preference of Ch. rapunculi. Our results show that Campanula flowers reflect the light predominantly in the UV-blue/blue bee-color space and that Ch. rapunculi displays a strong innate preference for these two colors. Furthermore, we recorded spiroacetals in the floral scent of all Campanula species, but Ca. lactiflora. Spiroacetals, rarely found as floral scent constituents but quite common among Campanula species, were recently shown to play a key function for host-flower recognition by Ch. rapunculi. We conclude that Campanula species share some visual and olfactory floral cues, and that neurological adaptations (i.e. vision and olfaction) of Ch. rapunculi innately drive their foraging flights toward host flowers.

The bivoltine bee Andrena bicolor is reported to be polylectic and oligolectic (on Campanula) in the spring and summer generations, respectively. Neurological constraints are assumed to govern pollen diet in bees. However, evidence comes predominantly from studies with oligolectic bees. We have investigated how sensory constraints influence the innate foraging behavior of A. bicolor and have tested whether bees of different generations evolved behavioral and sensory polyphenism to cope better with the host flowers available in nature when they are active. Results: Behavioral and sensory polyphenisms were tested in choice assays and electroantennographic analyses, respectively. In the bioassays, we found that females of both generations (1) displayed a similar innate relative reliance on visual and olfactory floral cues irrespective of the host plants tested; (2) did not prefer floral cues of Campanula to those of Taraxacum (or vice versa) and (3) did not display an innate preference for yellow and lilac colors. In the electroantennographic analyses, we found that bees of both generations responded to the same set of compounds. Conclusion: Overall, we did not detect seasonal polyphenism in any trait examined. The finding that bees of both generations are not sensory constrained to visit a specific host flower, which is in strict contrast to results from studies with oligolectic bees, suggest that also bees of the second generation have a flexibility in innate foraging behavior and that this is an adaptive trait in A. bicolor.

M. microsticta was active during July and August and utilized the introduced composite, Hypochaeris radicata L, as a principal pollen source. Aspects of female diurnal activity based on 20 individual bees are analyzed. Females begin the day by foraging for pollen. No pollen is brought to the nest on the last trip of the day, which is presumably used to gather nectar. Eight to 12 pollen loads are collected per day, sufficient to provision one cell. The multicellular nests are described and illustrated. Cell depth ranged from 3.5-12 cm. Provision mass, egg placement, and larval feeding are similar to what has been reported for other Melissodes. The cocoon is described and illustrated. Parasitic bees, Triepeolus sp., were active at the nest site and frequently entered M microsticta nests although no parasitized cells were recovered. The bee-hunting wasp, Philanthus crabroniformis Smith, was observed capturing a male M. microsticta on one occasion and unsuccessful attacks on males and females were observed.","nesting biology of the bee melissodes (eumelissodes) microsticta cockerell in","Melissodes microsticta Cockerell nested gregariously in a vacant lot in"

Conversely, introduced biotically pollinated plants might facilitate improved pollinator services to native plants by supporting higher pollinator densities and extending the flowering season. We examined weekly pollinator visitation to native and introduced plants, at five elevations over two flowering seasons on The Remarkables range, south-central South Island, New Zealand. In this area, introduced plants dominate the vegetation at lower elevations but are restricted to disturbed areas above treeline. We tested whether pollinator visitation rates and quantities of introduced pollen on insects or transferred to native flowers differed with elevation and community context, or with the local abundance of introduced flowers regardless of elevation. Introduced biotically pollinated plants produced more flowers and flowered later than most native species and were extensively utilised by native solitary bees. Weekly visitation rates to native flowers were higher in the first half of the flowering season than the second half, and were positively correlated with visitation rates to co-occurring introduced flowers. Introduced flower abundance did not affect visitation to native flowers but did significantly predict the occurrence of introduced pollen on native insects and stigmas of native flowers. Pollen contamination was also higher in the latter part of the flowering season. While an increase in introduced flowers at high elevations may benefit native pollinators by increasing the quantity and duration of floral resources available, the heavy use of introduced flowers by native bees will lead to at least localised stigma contamination, particularly for late flowering species. However, more information is required on foraging ranges of native pollinators and pollen limitation in native species to understand the consequences of introduced species expansion into alpine areas. © 2018, Swiss Botanical Society.","are introduced plants a threat to native pollinator services in","While introduced plants often have restricted distributions at high elevations,"

Honey bees and bumble bees are eusocial central place foragers. Honey bees have large perennial colonies while bumble bee colonies are annual and considerably smaller. Foraging range, body size, and division of labor also vary between these two bee species. Honey bees use their unique dance language to recruit foragers to the most profitable patches. Bumble bees exploit patches individually and develop trapline foraging patterns. We expect such differences among bee species to engender differences in foraging activity. Moreover, variation in resource availability and in colony needs over the flowering season, can affect bee foraging activity. Finally, spatial variation in resource availability may impact bumble bees to a greater extent than honey bees due to their smaller foraging range. Using miniaturized radio frequency identification (RFID), we tracked the foraging activity of individual bees to and from hives at three sites and over five time periods. Pollen pellets were also collected from bees returning to the hive. We compared the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, and the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. Linear mixed effect models determined the impact of bee species, time of season (period) and site, and their interactions, on multiple foraging metrics calculated from the RFID data and on pollen dry weight. Relative to honey bees, individual bumble bees made more foraging trips each day, resulting in a greater time spent foraging. A greater proportion of RFID tagged bumble bees foraged each day and bumble bees brought heavier pollen sacs to the hive compared to honey bees. Foraging bout duration did not vary between bee species and none of the foraging metrics varied among time periods or among sites. Both bee species brought heavier pollen sacs back to the hive at the beginning and the end of the flowering season. These results are discussed in terms of species differences in foraging strategies, size of individuals and colonies, and temporal variation in colony needs and resource availability. © 2018 Minahan and Brunet.","strong interspecific differences in foraging activity observed between honey bees","Central place foragers depart from and return to a central"

Like other stingless bees, this species plays an important ecological role as a pollinator. The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic structure and evolutionary history of P. seridoensis across its current geographic range. Workers from 84 nests from 17 localities were analyzed for COI and Cytb genic regions. The population structure tests (Bayesian phylogenetic inference, AMOVA and haplotype network) consistently characterized two haplogroups (northwestern and eastern), with little gene flow between them, generating a high differentiation between them as well as among the populations within each haplogroup. The Mantel test revealed no isolation by distance. No evidence of a potential geographic barrier in the present that could explain the diversification between the P. seridoensis haplogroups was found. However, Pleistocene climatic changes may explain this differentiation, since the initial time for the P. seridoensis lineages diversification took place during the mid-Pleistocene, specifically the interglacial period, when the biota is presumed to have been more associated with dry conditions and had more restricted, fragmented geographical distribution. This event may have driven diversification by isolating the two haplogroups. Otherwise, the climatic changes in the late Pleistocene must not have drastically affected the population dynamics of P. seridoensis, since the Bayesian Skyline Plot did not reveal any substantial fluctuation in effective population size in either haplogroup. Considering its importance and the fact that it is an endemic bee from a very threatened Neotropical dry forest, the results herein could be useful to the development of conservation strategies for P. seridoensis.","pleistocene climate changes shaped the population structure of partamona seridoensis","Partamona seridoensis is an endemic stingless bee from the Caatinga,"

While rapid transitions in tree communities are well documented across these variable soils, few studies have investigated the role of habitat heterogeneity in structuring animal communities. Stingless bees are taxonomically diverse and important natural pollinators in Neotropical forests. However, little is known about their community structuring at local scales in naturally heterogeneous environments. We systematically sampled stingless bee communities found across three paired sites that included adjacent patches of white-sand and non-white-sand forest in the lowland Amazonian region of Loreto, Peru. We sought to understand: (1) How stingless bee species richness and abundance differ among white-sand and non-white-sand habitats and (2) The relative influence of fine scale geographic distance and habitat type in structuring stingless bee communities. We found that species richness did not differ between habitats and that species abundances were highest in white-sand habitats. Community analyses for sampling sites pooled across all months demonstrated that location and soil type played a significant role in structuring bee communities and that community turnover may be more strongly influenced by distance in white-sand habitats than non-white sand habitats. Our results suggest that distance and habitat play an important role in driving stingless bee community turnover at fine scales and that the interaction between habitat and geographic distance may promote higher stingless bee community turnover in white-sand habitats than non-white sand habitats.","distance and habitat drive fine scale stingless bee (hymenoptera: apidae)","High tree species richness in the western Amazon has been"

They show the connection between TEE and honeybee colony success, or failure, in the rate of return, in terms of distance or quality of foraging.

Such multiple paternity within fruits can have important consequences for both parental and offspring fitness, but little is known about the frequency of multiple paternity or the mechanisms causing it. In this study we quantify the extent of multiple paternity in replicate experimental arrays of Mimulus ringens (square-stem monkeyflower) and use observations of pollinator behavior to infer mechanisms generating multiply sired fruits. In each array, floral displays were trimmed to two, four, eight, or 16 flowers per plant to span the range of display sizes observed in nature. In our sample of 204 fruits, more than 95% had two or more outcross pollen donors. The number of sires per fruit averaged 4.63 ± 0.10 (mean ± 1 SE), including selfs, and did not vary significantly with floral display treatment. Patterns of bumble bee foraging, combined with limited pollen carryover, suggest that observed levels of multiple paternity cannot be fully explained by single probes that deposited mixed pollen loads. Multiple probes to flowers, each delivering pollen from 1-3 different sires, are more likely to have caused the observed patterns. These sequential visits may reduce the potential for pollen competition and female choice based on pollen tube growth rate.","patterns of multiple paternity in fruits of mimulus ringens (phrymaceae)","Multiply sired fruits provide unambiguous evidence that pollen from two"

Pollinators visiting large floral displays may probe several flowers in sequence, leading to geitonogamous (among-flower) self-pollination. To investigate the relationship between floral display size and patterns of pollinator movement, we studied foraging by several pollinator species in four replicate arrays of Mimulus ringens (Scrophulariaceae). In each array displays were trimmed to two, four, eight and 16 flowers per plant. 2. Bees preferred large displays, and probed more flowers in sequence on large than on small displays. However, the proportion of available flowers probed decreased with display, resulting in nearly equal floral visitation rates across treatments. 3. Because pollinators probed more flowers in sequence on large displays, plants with numerous flowers should experience more geitonogamous self-pollination than plants with small displays. 4. In all four treatments, pollinators frequently visited only one flower before leaving the plant. As the first flower probed on a plant cannot receive geitonogamous pollen, this potentially reduces selfing rates for those flowers, compared to flowers probed late in a long visitation sequence on a plant. Such differences among flowers in pollination history should increase variation in geitonogamous self-pollination among fruits within plants. 5. The three most abundant pollinator species differed significantly in behaviours that could influence plant mating patterns, including number of flowers probed per plant; interplant movement distances; and grooming. Variation in foraging patterns was also evident among individuals within species. These subtle differences in response should affect the pollination services provided to plants.","the influence of mimulus ringens floral display size on pollinator","1.

We successfully amplified DNA from similar to 20-year-old museum specimens and determined the genetic diversity of B. diversus in Ashiu populations from the 1980s. Results were analyzed for indications of a bottleneck as well as estimates of N (e), allelic richness, rare allelic richness, expected heterozygosity, and the effective number of alleles. Our findings did not reveal clear evidence of degradation in genetic diversity of the extant Ashiu population compared to the museum specimens or to the Hyonosen population.

In this study, I use surveys of floral visitor communities across the geographic range of Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana (hereafter C. x. xantiana) (Onagraceae) to examine the structure of visitor communities, the specificity of the pollination system, and the role of variation in the abiotic vs. biotic environment in contributing to spatial variation in pollinator abundance and community composition. Although the assemblage of bee visitors to C. x. xantiana is very diverse (49 species), few were regular visitors and likely to act as pollinators. Seventy-four percent of visitor species accounted for only 11% of total visitor abundance and 69% were collected in three or fewer plant populations (of ten). Of the few reliable visitors, Clarkia pollen specialist bees were the most frequent visitors, carried more Clarkia pollen compared to generalist foragers, and were less likely to harbor foreign pollen. Overall, the core group of pollinators was obscured by high numbers of incidental visitors that are unlikely to contribute to pollination. In a geographic context, the composition of specialist pollinator assemblages varied considerably along the abiotic gradient spanning the subspecies' range. However, the overall abundance of specialist pollinators in plant populations was not influenced by the broad-scale abiotic gradient but strongly affected by local plant community associations. C. x. xantiana populations sympatric with pollinator-sharing congeners were visited twice as often by specialists compared to populations occurring alone.

To understand how the bee achieves thermal stability at different reward rates, the metabolic rates of undisturbed foraging bees were measured at different Ta values and different sucrose solution flow rates. Metabolic heat production, calculated from the rate of carbon dioxide production, decreased linearly from 49.7 to 23.4 mW as Ta increased from 19 to 29°C (sucrose flow rate 1.75 μl min-1, 50% w/w). In contrast, crop load and inspection rate remained constant. Metabolic rate displayed a linear relationship with both Ta and the logarithm of the flow rate of sucrose solution (range analyzed 0.44-13.1 μl min-1, 50% w/w). Metabolic rate decreased by 3.13±0.52 mW (mean ± S.E.M., N=37) for every 1°C increase in Ta and increased by 4.36±1.13 mW for a doubling in flow rate. These changes in metabolic power output might be used to achieve thermal stability during foraging.

Many of the arguments deployed in opposition to these restrictions were misleading, and based upon flawed research, much of it funded by neonicotinoid manufacturers themselves. The two principal arguments against restricting neonicotinoids were that yields would suffer, and that farmers would resort to older, even more harmful chemicals. However, evidence from Italy, where neonicotinoids have been banned from use on maize since 2008, suggests the opposite. Moreover, the EU precautionary approach on neonicotinoids represents a potential turning point for acting more widely to replace highly hazardous chemical pesticides with effective and sustainable alternatives. To achieve this, collaborative effort is needed on the part of governments, industry, civil society organisations, retailers and others. The Pesticide Action Network UK (PAN UK) welcomes the recent decision by the European Commission (EC) to place a temporary suspension on some uses of the three neonicotinoid pesticides, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and clothianidin. We believe that the steps taken by the Commission are a measured and reasonable response to the conclusions on the unacceptable risks posed to wild pollinators as identified in the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reports on these actives (EFSA, 2013). The new measures introduced in April by the EC, following much discussion and debate, mean that these three actives can no longer be used as seed treatments on any flowering crop that is attractive to bees. This is for a provisional period of two years starting in December 2013, to allow Member States to assess the impact, positive or negative, this will have on bee populations. PAN UK recognises that neonicotinoids, and indeed other pesticides, are not the only threats facing wild pollinators. Other pressures, including access to forage, disease and parasites, have all been implicated in the alarming declines in pollinator populations witnessed in recent years. Nevertheless, the European restrictions provide a small window of opportunity in which it should be possible, given the correct incentives and support from a range of stakeholders, to adopt more holistic agro-ecological approaches to pest management in the crops that are affected by the temporary restrictions. © 2013 Research Information Ltd.

However, the success of microbiological control agents (MCAs) largely depends on efficient dissemination into the crop. The pollinator-and-vector technology employs pollinating insects like bees for a better dissemination. In this study, a new dispenser for bumblebee workers of Bombus terrestris L. was developed. Binab-T-vector and Prestop-Mix were used as two typical MCA products for dissemination.RESULTS: In a first series of experiments in the laboratory for optimisation, the newly developed dispenser was a two-way type dispenser, 20 cm long, with two rectangular compartments and different entrance and exit holes. In addition, the amounts of MCA loaded on the workers were 10 times higher with the new dispenser as compared with the side-by-side passageway (SSP) dispenser. Typically, the highest amounts were recovered from the thorax and legs of the workers. In a second series of experiments under greenhouse conditions with the use of queen-right B. terrestris hives, successful dissemination in strawberry flowers was obtained at different distances from the hive (0-8 m, 8-18 m and 18-21 m), and the workers inoculated the first, second and third flowers that were consecutively visited. In addition, the new dispenser caused no adverse effects on worker foraging intensity, whereas a dramatic reduction was scored with an SSP dispenser. Finally, the data suggested that it is necessary to refill the newly developed dispenser at 3 day intervals.CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that, with the use of the newly developed dispenser, bumblebee workers carried high amounts of MCA, and this resulted in a successful dissemination of MCA into strawberry flowers. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.","development of a new dispenser for microbiological control agents and","BACKGROUND: To date, in modern agriculture, biological control strategies are"

In the field it is likely that worker bees are exposed to pesticides during foraging. To date, several tests exist to assess lethal and sublethal side-effects of pesticides on bee survival, growth/development and reproduction. Within the context of ecotoxicology and insect physiology, we report the development of a new bioassay to assess the impact of sublethal concentrations on the bumblebee foraging behavior under laboratory conditions. In brief, the experimental setup of this behavior test consists of two artificial nests connected with a tube of about 20 cm and use of queenless micro-colonies of 5 workers. In one nest the worker bees constructed brood, and in the other food (sugar and pollen) was provided. Before exposure, the worker bees were allowed a training to forage for untreated food; afterwards this was replaced by treated food. Using this setup we investigated the effects of sublethal concentrations of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, known to negatively affect the foraging behavior of bees. For comparison within the family of neonicotinoid insecticides, we also tested different concentrations of two other neonicotinoids: thiamethoxam and thiacloprid, in the laboratory with the new bioassay. Finally to evaluate the new bioassay, we also tested sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid in the greenhouse with use of queenright colonies of B. terrestris, and here worker bees needed to forage/fly for food that was placed at a distance of 3 m from their hives. In general, the experiments showed that concentrations that may be considered safe for bumblebees can have a negative influence on their foraging behavior. Therefore it is recommended that behavior tests should be included in risk assessment tests for highly toxic pesticides because impairment of the foraging behavior can result in a decreased pollination, lower reproduction and finally in colony mortality due to a lack of food. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","risk assessment for side-effects of neonicotinoids against bumblebees with and","Bombus terrestris bumblebees are important pollinators of wild flowers, and"

Flowering crops offer pulsed and abundant floral resources (i.e., mass flowering crops) that might promote pollinator spill-over between cultivated and adjacent natural areas. We explored pollinator patterns in the mass flowering legume crop Hedysarum coronarium and its influence on the bee pollinator communities of adjacent shrublands in a heterogeneous and patchy agricultural landscape: We studied the temporal (i.e., during vs. after mass flowering in adjacent shrublands) and spatial (i.e., inside crops, adjacent and distant shrublands during mass flowering) functional pollinator spill-over. The honeybee was highly attracted to Hedysarum crops, yet its abundance and that of other bee species visiting native plants in adjacent shrublands did not differ during and after Hedysarum mass flowering. However, at the landscape scale, the honeybee and the other bee species were less abundant in shrublands adjacent to Hedysarum crops compared to distant ones; their visitation rates showing a similar trend. These results show that some mass flowering crops can influence pollinator patterns in the surrounding landscape by competing for generalist pollinators with native plants. The characteristics of the crop species and the landscape can modulate and determine the role of mass flowering crops as competitors or supporters of wild pollinators for adjacent natural areas.

Introduced entomophilous non-native plants usually become well integrated into the diet of generalist pollinators. This integration can affect the entire recipient plant-pollinator network. Effects vary from facilitative to competitive, and understanding the factors that govern such variability is one of the fundamental goals in invasion ecology. Species traits determine the linking patterns between plant and pollinator species. Therefore, trait similarity among plants or among pollinators might modulate how they affect each other. 2. We conducted a flower removal experiment to investigate the effects of the non-native entomophilous legume Hedysarum coronarium on the pollination patterns of a Mediterranean shrubland plant-pollinator network. Specifically, we explored whether effects were influenced by similarity with the resident plant species in flower morphology (papilionate vs. non-papilionate), and whether effects on the pollinator community were influenced by similarity in functional group with its main visitor species (bees vs. non-bees). In addition, we explored whether Hedysarum had an effect on the identity of interactions. For this purpose, we calculated the interaction rewiring, that is the number of plant-pollinator interactions that were gained or lost after invasion. 3. Hedysarum was well integrated into the diet of 15 generalist pollinators having the honeybee as its main visitor species. Such integration did not affect visitation rates, normalized degree (i. e. proportion of pollinators they are visited by) nor niche overlap (i. e. proportion of plant species they share pollinators with) of plants, irrespective of their flower morphology. Only the proportion of honeybee visits to resident plants decreased with invasion. On the other hand, Hedysarum reduced visitation rates and niche overlap of pollinators, mainly those of bee species. Finally, we observed that changes in the foraging behaviour of the honeybee were positively associated with the interaction rewiring involving the rest (92 taxa) of pollinators. 4. In conclusion, pollinators show a plastic use of floral resources, responding to the presence of non-native plants. When the non-native attracts highly competitive pollinators such as the honeybee, plasticity is especially significant in pollinators that are functionally close to that competitive pollinator. The result is an interaction rewiring, probably due to pollinators avoiding competition with the honeybee. Though this plasticity might not quantitatively affect the pollination of plants, consequences on their reproduction and the functioning of the network can derive from the interaction rewiring.","influence of the honeybee and trait similarity on the effect","1.

These declines may have significant ecological consequences, because bumblebees pollinate a large range of plant species. Our study was carried out in heathlands, open semi-natural habitats that have decreased considerably due to human activities. We analysed how floral resources affect bumblebee communities throughout the colony lifetime at three scales: plot scale, heathland patch scale, and landscape scale. Floral density at the plot scale and spruce plantations at the landscape scale influenced bumblebee communities. The abundance of bumblebees on ericaceous species was higher when the landscape included a substantial proportion of unsuitable foraging habitat (i.e., spruce plantations). Both life history traits and colony life cycle stage influenced bumblebee responses to the availability of floral resources. Bumblebees were more affected by floral resources during the colony development phase than during the nest-foundation or mating phases. Moreover, bumblebees of species that form large colonies needed larger quantities of favourable foraging habitat, compared with small-colony bees, and their proportion decreased in habitats dominated by spruce plantations. In conclusion, the conservation of plant–bumblebee interactions will require management at a larger spatial scale than the restricted protected habitats. Moreover, at the landscape scale, both quantity of favourable foraging patches and their ecological continuity are important to conserve both small- and large- colony species. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","spatial and temporal variations in floral resource availability affect bumblebee","Modifications of landscape structure and composition can decrease the availability"

A clonal woody species, Prunus ssiori, was partially self-incompatible according to a pollination experiment. Its main pollinators, bumble bees, were often observed to consecutively visit inflorescences within a tree. Clone identification revealed that its genets formed mutually exclusive patches. These features suggest frequent geitonogamous pollination. In a 6.24-ha plot, 212 trees belonged to 59 genets, and 42 genets consisted of a single tree, whereas the rest contained two or more clonal trees. The largest genet had 65 trees and occupied 0.4 of a hectare. Fruit set was measured in 127 inflorescences sampled from nine maternal trees at the center of the plot. Paternal genets of 107 of their 300 seeds were assigned in the plot using microsatellites. There were no selfed seeds. Male reproductive success (the probability that individual trees of each genet sired a seed) increased as tree size increased, as the distance between the trees and maternal trees decreased, when the genet did not contain the maternal trees, and when the genet consisted of a single tree. Female reproductive success (fruit set in individual inflorescences of each maternal tree) increased as the within-tree geitonogamy index, which reflected the frequency of pollination within the maternal tree, decreased. These results suggest that clonal growth reduces male reproductive success, at least, in P. ssiori, because of pollen discounting.","clonal growth and its effects on male and female reproductive","Clonal growth can increase not only floral display but also"

This: is especially true with hybrid seeds which could be produced using the two genetic male-sterility systems available. For two years, we studied the effectiveness of honey bees as pollinators to produce hybrid seeds of globe artichoke under insect-proof enclosures. We used two adjacent 10 x 6 m tunnels covered with 1-mm mesh screen and planted with 2 male-fertile (MF) and 7 male-sterile (MS) lines (Tab, 1). Each tunnel was provided with a colony of 3,500 bees at the onset of MF flowering. Flowering of MS and MF lines was well synchronized (Fig. 1), and the number of newer heads per plant was similar for all lines. Yet, there were over 10-fold differences in both years in the density of foragers that visited the various lines with extremes of 0.04 to 1.18 honey bees per head (Fig. 2). Some foragers collected pollen, but these were rarely seen on MS heads. The ranking of MS lines in terms of forager density was similar over both seasons, which suggests that die differences in attractiveness among these lines were of genetic origin and probably resulted from differences in nectar availability or composition. Yield of achenes per plant also varied significantly among lines (Fig. 3). The proportion of heads that were empty ranged from 23% Co 100% among MS lines, and for each season was negatively correlated with the average forager density on each line (Fig. 4). The number of achenes per head in the flower heads which were not empty did not vary significantly among MS Lines (Tab. II), which suggests that the pollination effectiveness of honey bee visits was similar among these different lines. This achene content was greater in MF heads, which is consistent with a greater pollination effectiveness of honey bees in this inflorescence due to the presence of pollen and some self-fertility in MF lines, The overall forager density was similar between the two seasons as was the proportion of empty MS heads, but the achene content of non-empty MS heads was significantly greater in the second year than in the first one (Tab. IT). This suggests that the pollination effectiveness of individual visits was greater in the second year. Pollen availability was similar in both seasons, but there were 5 rimes Fewer foragers collecting pollen in the second year compared to the first one. The pool of pollen is limited when producing hybrid seed, especially in confined environments, and our results suggest that in these situations the level of pollen collection may negatively affect the pollination activity of honey bee colonies.","pollination of globe artichoke (cynara scolymus l.) by honey bees","Globe artichoke is currently multiplied mainly by vegetative means, but"

However, little attention has been paid to man-made structures that can moderate spatial processes affecting pollinator communities. In a large-scale study, we explored the importance of railway embankments for the turnover of pollinator species in agricultural landscapes. Because species differ in vulnerability to landscape composition and patch configuration, we also accounted for body size as well as food specialization of pollinators. Location: Kraków area, Poland. Methods: We sampled pollinating insects (bees, butterflies and hoverflies), at 25 study sites located along railway lines in the region of Kraków, Poland. Control grasslands for the embankments included 19 patches, located among crop fields, in which pollinators were sampled. We assessed the relationships between dissimilarity and distance for bee, butterfly and hoverfly trait groups on embankments and grasslands using Moran's Eigenvector Maps. Results: The dissimilarity for food-non-specialized bees on embankments was spatially structured: sites that were closer together were also less dissimilar in their community composition than more distant ones. Dissimilarity was also spatially aligned for large-bodied butterflies and hoverflies on embankments. The species dissimilarity of pollinators divided into trait-based groups was not spatially structured on grasslands. Main conclusion: Our study highlights the potential function of railway embankments as corridors for at least some pollinator populations. Landscape managers should include railways in green networks to improve spatial processes linked with the distribution and turnover of pollinator species in agricultural landscapes. Thus, railway embankments and their correct management may be a good example of man-made alterations in the environment that meet the demands of both civilization and biodiversity conservation. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","railway lines affect spatial turnover of pollinator communities in an","Aim: Landscape composition and spatial configuration of habitat patches are"

Wild bees are one of the most important groups of pollinators in the temperate zone. Therefore, population declines have potentially negative impacts for both crop and wildflower pollination. Although heavy metal pollution is recognized to be a problem affecting large parts of the European Union, we currently lack insights into the effects of heavy metals on wild bees. 2. We investigated whether heavy metal pollution is a potential threat to wild bee communities by comparing (i) species number, (ii) diversity and (iii) abundance as well as (iv) natural mortality of emerging bees along two independent gradients of heavy metal pollution, one at Olkusz (OLK), Poland and the other at Avonmouth (AVO), UK. We used standardized nesting traps to measure species richness and abundance of wild bees, and we recorded the heavy metal concentration in pollen collected by the red mason bee Osmia rufa as a measure of pollution. 3. The concentration of cadmium, lead and zinc in pollen collected by bees ranged from a background level in unpolluted sites [OLK: 1 3, 43 4, 99 8 (mg kg(-1)); AVO: 0 8, 42 0, 56 0 (mg kg(-1)), respectively] to a high level on sites in the vicinity of the OLK and AVO smelters [OLK: 6.7, 277.0, 440.1 (mg kg(-1)); AVO: 9.3, 356.2, 592.4 (mg kg(-1)), respectively]. 4. We found that with increasing heavy metal concentration, there was a steady decrease in the number, diversity and abundance of solitary, wild bees. In the most polluted sites, traps were empty or contained single occupants, whereas in unpolluted sites, the nesting traps collected from 4 to 5 species represented by up to ten individuals. Moreover, the proportion of dead individuals of the solitary bee Megachile ligniseca increased along the heavy metal pollution gradient at OLK from 0.2 in uncontaminated sites to 0.5 in sites with a high concentration of pollution. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings highlight the negative relationship between heavy metal pollution and populations of wild bees and suggest that increasing wild bee richness in highly contaminated areas will require special conservation strategies. These may include creating suitable nesting sites and sowing a mixture of flowering plants as well as installing artificial nests with wild bee cocoons in polluted areas.

We also evaluate bee responses according to functional traits such as body size. We found that bees were affected by factors on multiple spatial scales. On the homegarden scale, the percentage flower cover best predicted pollinator attraction, if, on the adjacent-habitat scale the percentage of surrounding homegardens was at least 20%. On the landscape scale, bee abundance, mainly of small species, increased when homegardens were closer to the forest. Increasing abundance of flower-visiting bees increased cucumber yield, with solitary bees being the most abundant flower visitors. We predicted that a 50% loss in bee abundance would translate into a 47% yield and associated income decline. Homegardens with a flower cover of 50%, being surrounded by a homegarden area of 50% and being established <100 m from the forest can translate in a nine-fold higher yield and income compared to homegardens with low flower cover (<15%), and isolated from other homegardens (<20%) and the forest (>1500 m). Our work suggests that farmers need to be aware of management practices not only at the local and landscape scale but also on the adjacent-habitat scale.

It has been demonstrated that ants can optimize their foraging path through an emergent process, involving the trail pheromone concentration, without individual ants having to measure and compare distances. In the current study, we investigated whether ants that use only tandem running to recruit their nestmates can minimize their path while relocating their entire colony into a new nest. As colony relocation directly impacts the survival of the whole colony, it would be particularly important to optimize their path to the new nest. Using the ponerine ant Diacamma indicum, we conducted relocation experiments, in which ants had to choose between different defined paths, and contrasted our findings with open arena experiments, as they navigated to their new nest. After following 4100 unique transports by 450 different transporters, we found that these ants do minimize their path. Individual leaders, as well as colonies, chose the shorter path significantly more than the longer path, and they showed a significant preference for the shorter arm at multiple decision points on encountering a combination of paths. Thus, we concluded that tandem leaders are capable of path minimization based on the information they themselves collect. Further investigation into the proximate mechanisms by which they achieve this is required. © 2019.

By this measure, 31 species (43%) were oligolectic (relatively specialized to pollen source) at the level of plant tribe, plant subfamily, or plant family. Exclusive pollen sources of these bees throughout their geographic ranges are flowers of the Cardueae (Compositae), the Asteroideae (Compositae), the Papilionoideae (Leguminosae), the Lamioideae (Labiatae), the Nepetoideae (Labiatae), the Dipsacaceae, or the Campanulaceae. Thirteen species (18%) were found to exhibit a strong, but not exclusive, preference for the Papilionoideae (Leguminosae), the Labiatae, the Cardueae (Compositae), and Zygophyllum (Zygophyllaceae), respectively, while 25 species (35%) proved to be more markedly polylectic, visiting the flowers of up to 17 different plant families for pollen.

By far the most important pollen sources of the anthidiine bees as a whole are the Compositae (41.7%) followed by the Leguminosae (23.1%) and the Labiatae (13.0%). The phylogenetic relationships of the anthidiine bees were estimated by a cladistic analysis based on 115 characters to trace possible evolutionary patterns of diet composition. Based on the estimated phylogeny, at least eight shifts of oligoleges between different plant taxa and six transitions between oligolecty and polylecty appear to have occurred. Four transitions were from oligolecty to polylecty whereas two transitions are of unknown direction, both directions being equally parsimonious. Assuming that the ancestral state in the anthidiine bees was oligolectic, the present distribution of oligolectic and polylectic species can be explained solely by switches from the oligolectic to the polylectic habit and by shifts of oligoleges between different plant taxa. Three of four transitions from oligolecty to polylecty are accompanied by a reduction in bee body size. The significance of this size reduction with respect to the polylectic habit is discussed. The oligolectic anthidiine species visit significantly fewer flower species for pollen during a single foraging bout than the polylectic species. On average, 1.4 plant species were recorded in the loads of specialists compared to 2.2 for generalists. Two monophyletic groups of bees belonging to the genus Anthidium are equipped with a pollen-collecting apparatus consisting of specialized hairs localized either on the face or on the underside of the thorax. It is used to remove pollen from the raised anthers of flowers of the Labiatae and the Scrophulariaceae and to brush pollen from the flat inflorescences of some Compositae, respectively. The observation of flower-visiting females of several anthidiine species revealed that pollen uptake is far from an accidental process. Basic pollen-harvesting techniques have reached a high degree of efficiency: females of a given bee species worked flowers of a certain plant species in a fixed manner, the structures used for pollen uptake from the same flower type were found to be largely the same among anthidiine bees of different taxonomic groups, and no distinct differences with respect to the basic pattern of pollen removal from flowers of the same architecture were obvious when comparing oligolectic and polylectic species. On the other hand, polyleges showed a high intraspecific flexibility regarding the organs used for pollen uptake from flowers of a different architecture.","host-plant specialization in western palearctic anthidiine bees (hymenoptera: apoidea: megachilidae)","To determine the extent of host-plant specialization, the pollen sources"

On-farm pollination experiments were therefore conducted in 30 small-scale coffee farms with contrasting land-use and management characteristics. The results indicated that coffee flowers were visited by 24-38 bee species with meliponine bee species being the most frequent visitors. The highest fruit set (84%) was recorded in hand cross-pollination followed by open pollination (62%) and bagged flowers (0.8%) treatment. Coffee proportion potential yield and bee contribution to fruit set were positively related to bee abundance, species richness, foraging rate and to the amount of semi-natural habitats available in the surroundings of coffee fields. Distance to forest/wetland and cultivation intensity were negatively related to coffee proportion potential yield but positively related to coffee pollination limitation. Farmers would benefit from establishing coffee fields in the vicinity of natural habitats and from adopting pollinator-friendly farming and conservation practices such as increasing the area of semi-natural habitat features as well as promoting high on-farm tree cover to protect good pollinators (e.g. meliponine bees) of coffee in the landscape. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","micro, local, landscape and regional drivers of bee biodiversity and","Bee diversity and pollination services delivery in coffee fields are"

The study was conducted in order to determine the best pollinator groups for coffee in Uganda and to collect relevant field information and determine the pollination efficiency of different bee species. Results indicate that across blooming seasons, coffee flowers were visited by 24-36 bee species. Hypotrigona gribodoi was the most frequent flower visitor, comprising over 60% of 5941 bee-visits recorded. Foraging rate and pollination speed varied among bee species. Solitary bees foraged on more flowers than social bees, but they spent less time per flower visited. Solitary bees visited more coffee trees and fields, but deposited less pollen, whereas social bees visited less trees and coffee fields in the landscape, but deposited more pollen on flowers. Fruit set was of 87%, 64% and 0.9%, respectively, in hand-cross pollination, open pollination and controlled-pollination treatments. Fruit abortion due to self-pollination was insignificant in this study. There was variability in pollination efficiency of different bee species. Pollination efficiency varied more significantly with sociality than with other bee functional traits and was not significantly influenced by tongue length and bee body size. Single-flower visits by social and solitary bees resulted in 89.7% and 68.14% fruit set, respectively. The most efficient bee species was Meliponula ferruginea (98.3%) followed by Meliponula nebulata (97.1%). Thus, very good pollinator species were wild social bees (mainly stingless bees) as opposed to honeybees and solitary bees that were previously reported to be the best pollinators of coffee in Panama and Indonesia. Morphological and anatomical characteristics of the bee pollen storage features may explain the difference in foraging behaviour activities and in pollination efficiency of social and solitary afrotropical bee species visiting lowland coffee in Uganda. In addition, pollination efficiency was influenced by land-use intensity, field management systems and habitat types found in the immediate surroundings of coffee fields, but not by coffee field size, coffee genotypes and mass blooming wild vegetation. It is recommended to farmers to adopt pollinator-friendly conservation and farming practices such as keeping an uncultivated portion (25%-30%) of their farms as pollinator reservoirs, protecting semi-natural habitats found in the vicinity of coffee fields, as well as promoting high on-farm tree cover to benefit a functionally diverse pollinator community.","influence of functional traits on foraging behaviour and pollination efficiency","An on-farm pollination experiment was conducted during the June-August and"

It has been shown that garden management regime (water use, floral composition) may impact the species they shelter. However, due to access restrictions, lack of regulations and the difficulty of data collection on private property, the impact of management practices and in particular pesticide use has seldom been assessed in private gardens. Using data collected in the framework of a nationwide participatory monitoring scheme in France, we assess here, for the first time, the effect of private garden management on two important groups of flower-visiting insects, i.e. butterflies and bumblebees, at a large scale. We show that the correlation between butterfly and bumblebee abundance and use of insecticides and herbicides is negative, whereas the use of Bordeaux mixture (fungicide approved for organic use), fungicides and anti-slugs is positively correlated with butterfly and bumblebee abundance. We hypothesize that herbicides have an indirect negative impact on insects by limiting the amount of available resources, and that the Bordeaux mixture, fungicides and slug repellants have an indirect positive impact on these insects by fostering healthier plants, probably offering higher level of resources to pollinators. Moreover, we show that the impact of pesticides varies according to the landscape, the negative effect of insecticides being more important in highly urbanized areas. Overall, our results show that gardener practices can have a positive impact on flower-visiting insects, even in a highly anthropized, urban landscape. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Foraging in ants is often a pheromonally mediated collective action performed by mature workers; age-dependent diVerences in olfactory response thresholds may therefore proximately regulate task repertoire development. In the ant Pheidole dentata, foraging activity increases with chronological age in minor workers, and is chemically controlled. The onset of foraging in minor workers is accompanied by marked neuroanatomical and neurochemical changes, including synaptic remodeling in olfactory regions of the brain, proliferation of serotonergic neurons, and increased brain titers of monoamines, notably serotonin. We examined the linkage of serotonin and olfactory responsiveness by assaying trail-following performance in mature P. dentata minor workers with normal serotonin levels, or serotonin levels experimentally lowered by oral administration of the serotonin synthesis inhibitor alpha-methyltryptophan (AMTP). By assessing responsiveness to standardized pheromone trails, we demonstrate that trail-following behaviors are significantly reduced in serotonin-depleted workers. AMTP-treated individuals were less likely to initiate trail following, and oriented along pheromone trails for significantly shorter distances than untreated, similar-age workers. These results demonstrate for the first time that serotonin modulates olfactory processes and/or motor functions associated with cooperative foraging in ants.","serotonin modulates worker responsiveness to trail pheromone in the ant","As social insect workers mature, outside-nest tasks associated with foraging"

We examined post-eclosion growth of three major muscles of the head capsule in major and minor workers of the ant Pheidole dentata using workers of different ages with distinct task repertoires. Mandible closer muscle fibers, which provide bite force and are thus critical for the use of the mandibles for biting and load carrying, fill the posterio-lateral portions of the head capsule in mature, older workers of both subcastes. Mandible closer fibers of newly eclosed workers, in contrast, are significantly thinner in both subcastes and grow during at least the next 6 days in minor workers, suggesting this muscle has reduced functionality for a substantial period of adult life and thus constrains task performance capability. Fibers of the antennal muscles and the pharynx dilator, which control antennal movements and food intake, respectively, also increase significantly in thickness with age. However, these fibers are only slightly thinner in newly eclosed workers and attain their maximum thickness over a shorter time span in minors. The different growth rates of these functionally distinct muscles likely have consequences for how adult P. dentata workers, particularly minors, develop their full and diverse task repertoire as they age. Workers may be capable of feeding and interacting socially soon after eclosion, but require a longer period of development to effectively use their mandibles, which enable the efficient performance of tasks ranging from nursing to foraging and defense.","coming of age in an ant colony: cephalic muscle maturation","Although several neurobiological and genetic correlates of aging and behavioral"

Honeybees and bumblebees are agriculturally important pollinators for whom the effects of stress are extremely relevant. These pollinators are often transported long distances during which colonies experience severe physical disturbance, causing stress to individuals prior to their release for pollination. Under natural foraging conditions, bees are excellent at learning about the flowers they forage from, including associations between floral stimuli and rewards. However, it is not clear how stress might affect bees' abilities to learn and remember floral features. Here we address the effects of acute stress on learning and memory in the bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. Using the Proboscis Extension Response (PER) protocol, we look at stress effects on learning and memory in three experiments. After being trained to a conditioned stimulus, we addressed: (1) the effect of 24. h and (2) 30. min of stress on the recall of this learned association and (3) the effect of stress on subsequently learning an association. We found that 24. h of stress after learning appeared to improve memory recall, and there was a trend in the same direction for 30. min of stress. However, bees that were stressed prior to learning an association did not differ from unstressed bees in their ability to learn or remember an association. Our finding that stress has effects on memory in the bumblebee could have implications for their use in behavioral experiments and for promoting the success of both managed and wild populations. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","the effects of acute stress on learning and memory in","Stress has complex effects on learning and memory, depending on"

This did not vary significantly over the temperature range 25.3°C≤Ta≤34.0°C, but was significantly lower at Ta=20°C. Over the range 22°C≤Ta≤26°C Pmrel was 0.379±0.07 W g-1. Relative metabolic power Pm rel was calculated from round-about or wind tunnel post-flight thorax cooling rates (exponentially rising from 1 to 5.5°C min-1 per °C temperature difference at wind velocities from 0 to 4.3 m s-1) and from differences between thorax surface temperature and ambient temperature (exponentially decreasing from 6 to 1°C over the same range of wind velocities). A value of Pmrel=0.195±0.09W g-1 was found, independent of wind velocity. From measurements of exhaustion flights of defined fed bees executing prolonged flights (30.6±4.7 min) in front of an open-jet wind tunnel, a relative metabolic power of 0.309±0.05 W g-1 was calculated, which did not vary significantly over the temperature range 25°C≤Ta≤35°C, but was significantly lower at Ta=20°C. Our data from 3 experimentally different determinations of Pmrel are compared to data from a number of literature sources. A critical discussion suggests probable values of approximately 0.3 W g-1 for tethered flights (round-abouts, wind-tunnels), 0.4 W g-1 for medium speed free-foraging flights, and 0.5 W g-1 for hovering flight. Probable mechanical flight power for a muscle efficiency of 0.2 in medium speed free-foraging flight is approximately 70 mW g-1 body mass (equivalent to 5.6 mW for an 'empty' 80 mg bee) and 230 mW g-1 flight muscle mass.

The mean outcrossing rate of mature fruit embryos in S. leprosula pollinated by thrips (0.91) was not lower than those previously reported from Shorea species pollinated by bees, even though thrips seem to be less efficient pollinators than bees. Although four of the five trees showed high and stable outcrossing rates during fruit maturation, the outcrossing rate increased in one tree with highly selfed embryos of immature fruits.

We estimated the genetic structure and environmental determinants of local genetic diversity in nuclear microsatellite genotypes of fathers and mothers, inferred from workers collected at 139 sites. The genotypes of fathers and mothers showed weak isolation by distance and negligible genetic structure.

However, nurses that are caged on brood-less combs inside or outside the hive show robust circadian rhythms with higher activity during the day, suggesting that direct contact with the brood mediates the plasticity in the circadian system. The nature of the brood signals affecting the workers' circadian system and the modalities by which they are detected are unknown. Given that the antennae are pivotal sensory organs in bees, we hypothesized that they are involved in mediating the brood influence on the plasticity in circadian rhythms. The flagella of the antennae are densely covered with diverse sensory structures able to detect a wide range of signals. To test our hypothesis, we removed the flagella of nurses and observed their behavior in isolation and in free-foraging colonies. We found that individually-isolated flagella-less bees under constant laboratory conditions show robust circadian rhythms in locomotor activity. In observation hives, flagella-less bees cared for the brood, but were more active during the day. By contrast, sham-treated bees were active around the clock as typical of nurses. Detailed video recordings showed that the brood-tending behavior of flagella-less and sham-treated bees is similar. These observations suggest that the difference in the patterns of brood care activity is not because the flagella-less bees did not contact the brood. Our results suggest that nurses are able to find the brood in the dark environment of the hive without their flagella, perhaps by using other sensory organs. The higher activity of flagella-less bees during the day further suggests that the flagella are involved in mediating the brood signals modulating plasticity in the circadian system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","the involvement of the antennae in mediating the brood influence","Age-related division of labor in honey bees is associated with"

The TT-neurons are able to resolve a relative change of 37% in stimulus intensity (Delta T) and antennal scanning of the thermal environment may aid the ant's ability to use temperature differences for orientation. The second cold sensitive neuron in the S. coelocapitulum responds to temperature only within a narrow temperature range. A temperature difference of 1.6 degrees C can be resolved by this neuron type. Since the working range matches the preferred temperature range for brood care of Camponotus rufipes, we hypothesize that this temperature sensor can function as a thermal switch to trigger brood care behavior, based on absolute (steady state) temperature.","two cold-sensitive neurons within one sensillum code for different parameters","Ants show high sensitivity when responding to minute temperature changes"

To obtain and serve biological information for sustainable forest management, we investigated reproductive biology and inbreeding depression in seeds of an important dipterocarp tree species, Shorea acuminata (Dipterocarpaceae), by both field and laboratory experiments. Results of parental analysis of immature and mature seeds showed that selfing rates varied greatly, from 7.6 to 88.4% among eight mother trees, and the mean overall selfing rate was 38.3%. Observed outcrossing events within a 40-ha study plot were predominantly (76.5%) short-distance events with a mating distance (md) : 100 m. Since the selfing rate sharply decreased with increase in the number of flowering conspecifics (i.e., individuals of the same species) within a 100-m radius from the mother trees, the local density of flowering conspecifics appears to be the key factor determining the outcrossing rate in S. acuminata. However, the extremely high selfing rate (88.4%) observed for one tree could not be simply explained by the low local density of flowering conspecifics. Instead, differences in its flowering phenology (its flowering peaked ca. a week earlier than most of the other examined individuals) may have severely limited its receipt of pollen from other conspecifics, and thus promoted selfing. Since there were no significant differences in the proportion of selfed progeny between immature and mature seed stages, there was no evidence of selective abortion of selfed seeds during seed development. However, the seed mass of outcrossed progeny was heavier than that of selfed progeny, and heavier seeds showed higher success rates at germination and seedling establishment. These results suggest that inbreeding depression resulted in reductions in seed mass and may reduce the fitness of selfed seeds in S. acuminata. In addition, the outcrossing rate of S. acuminata was more sensitive to low local conspecific flowering-tree densities than that of a sympatric bee-pollinated dipterocarp, species with greater pollination distances. These results suggest that the management of local adult-tree densities is important for avoiding selfing and inbreeding depression in future generations, especially in a species like S. acuminata with predominantly short-distance pollination.

Whether foraging honeybees can make similarly complex navigational decisions from locations away from the hive is unknown. To examine whether or not such secondary decision-makinghubs exist, we trained bees to forage at four different locations. Specifically, we trained honeybees to first forage to a distal site ""CT"" 100 m away from the hive; if food was present, they fed and then chose to go home. If food was not present, the honeybees were trained to forage to three auxiliary sites, each at a different time of the day: A in the morning, B at noon, and C in the afternoon. The foragers learned to check site CT for food first and then efficiently depart to the correct location based upon the time of day if there was no food at site CT. Thus, the honeybees were able to cognitively map motivation, time, and five different locations (Hive, CT, A, B, and C) in two spatial dimensions; these are the contents of the cognitive map used by the honeybees here. While at site CT, we verified that the honeybees could choose between 4 different directions (to A, B, C, and the Hive) and thus label it as a secondary decision-making hub. The observed decision making uncovered here is inferred to constitute genuine logical operations, involving a branched structure, based upon the premises of motivational state, and spatiotemporal knowledge. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","interpatch foraging in honeybees-rational decision making at secondary hubs based","For honeybees, Apis mellifera, the hive has been well known"

Generally, we demonstrate that a single foraging cohort of honeybees is shown to be capable of making decisions based upon different sets of learned cues, in the exact same context.

In this study, we examine the possible factors affecting the learning and retention of nest-associated visual cues by the Australian desert ant Melophorus bagoti and the manner in which such cues are encoded by foraging ants. We placed four prominent cylindrical landmarks around a nest and trained foragers from that nest to a food source. Ants were tested with the landmark array in a distant testing field after (1) a known number of exposures to the landmarks (1, 3, 7 or 15 trials, spread over a period of 1 day, 2 days or ≥3 days) and (2) after a known period of delay (0, 24, 48, 96 or 192 h). The results show that a combination of an increase in training trials and an increase in number of training days affected the acquisition of landmark memory. Moreover, once the landmarks were learnt, they became a part of long-term memory and lasted throughout the ants' foraging lifetime. To examine visual cue encoding behaviour, ants trained under similar conditions for 4 days were tested with (1) an identical landmark array, (2) landmarks of the same size used in training, but placed at twice the distance from each other, and (3) landmarks whose dimensions were doubled and placed at twice the distance from each other. In conditions (1) and (3), the ants searched extensively at the centre of the four landmarks, suggesting that, similar to the Saharan ant (genus Cataglyphis) and the honeybee, M. bagoti too uses a snapshot to match the view of the landmarks around the nest. But contrary to the snapshot model, in condition (2), the ants did not search extensively at the centre of the landmarks, but searched primarily 0.5 m from the landmark, the distance from each landmark to the nest during training.

The ants have typical apposition compound eyes with 596 ommatidia per eye and an interommatidial angle of 6.0 degrees. We find the ants have developed large lenses (33 mu m in diameter) and wide rhabdoms (5 mu m in diameter) to make their eyes highly sensitive to low light conditions. To be active at bright light conditions, the ants have developed an extreme pupillary mechanism during which the primary pigment cells constrict the crystalline cone to form a narrow tract of 0.5 mu m wide and 16 mu m long. This pupillary mechanism protects the photoreceptors from bright light, making the eyes less sensitive during the day.

The temporal polyethism schedule is sensitive to colony perturbations that may lead to adaptive changes in task allocation, maintaining colony homeostasis. Though social insects can be infected by a range of parasites, little is known of how these parasites impact within-colony behaviour and the temporal polyethism schedule. We use honey bees (Apis mellifera) experimentally infected by two of their emerging pathogens, Deformed wing virus (DWV), which is relatively understudied concerning its behavioural impact on its host, and the exotic microsporidian Nosema ceranae. We examined parasite effects on host temporal polyethism and patterns of activity within the colony. We found that pathogens accelerated the temporal polyethism schedule, but without reducing host behavioural repertoire. Infected hosts exhibited increased hyperactivity, allocating more time to self-grooming and foraging-related tasks. The strength of behavioural alterations we observed was found to be pathogen specific; behavioural modifications were more pronounced in virus-treated hosts versus N. ceranae-treated hosts, with potential benefits for the colony in terms of reducing within-colony transmission. Investigating the effects of multiple pathogens on behavioural patterns of social insects could play a crucial role in understanding pathogen spread within a colony and their effects on colony social organisation. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","parasites modulate within-colony activity and accelerate the temporal polyethism schedule","Task allocation in social insect colonies is generally organised into"

Little attention, however, has been given to floral traits, and almost no data have been collected on the effects of fire on pollinator activity and fruit-set. This paper reports the effects of fire on flower visitation rates and the possibly related fruit-set. We compared visitation rates of the main pollinators on four plant core-species in burned and adjacent unburned areas. Measurements were performed at an unburned phrygana (scrub lands), and at a burned area (5-7 years post-fire). Bumble bees and solitary bees were the main taxa of visitors, while few honeybees were recorded. Solitary bees were almost absent from the burned area. Fruit-set was significantly higher in the unburned area for three out of the four plant species. The lower fruit-set in the burned area was possibly the result of low activity of solitary bees which are the main effective pollinators of the examined species. We hypothesize that the populations of the solitary bees were diminished or extirpated either directly by the fire, or indirectly by the scarcity of nectar in the early post-fire years due to dominance of young pine and Cistus spp. seedlings. The short foraging range of the solitary bees and their slow invasion rate into the burned area may explain our results.","the effect of fire on flower visitation rate and fruit","The recovery of vegetation following fire has been studied intensively"

Habitat fragmentation is thought to threaten biodiversity, but the response of pollinators to fragmentation is still poorly understood, and research seldom includes pollinator nesting requirements. 2. We investigated pollinator community composition in a highly fragmented oak-savannah ecosystem in south-western British Columbia, Canada. We sampled pollinators in 19 fragments ranging from 0.3 to 31 ha and surrounded by a variety of land-use types, including forest, low-density suburban, and urban neighbourhoods. Pan-trapping and netting surveys captured 4464 bees, flies, and wasps in 138 species and 48 genera. 3. Contrary to expectations, overall species richness did not increase with fragment size. However, ground-nester abundance (not diversity) and cavity-nester diversity (not abundance) were higher in larger fragments, as expected. Floral richness and abundance did not foster pollinator diversity for either guild. Brood parasite responses were complex: host availability (ground-nesting bees) was generally important, richness and abundance increased in fragments with high surrounding road density, and abundance also increased in fragments with other habitat fragments nearby. 4. Responses of different nesting guilds to fragmentation may be related to their use of the landscape surrounding habitat fragments. Some common cavity nesters can nest in fences and gardens, but urban land use may be less hospitable for ground nesters. Brood parasites apparently respond both to host availability and landscape characteristics associated with movement among fragments. 5. Consideration of nesting requirements of pollinators provided some insight into their response to habitat loss in our analysis and should be considered in future studies of fragmentation impacts on pollinator biodiversity.","pollinator nesting guilds respond differently to urban habitat fragmentation in",". 1.

We sought to predict the overall impact of climate change on venomous terrestrial species. We hypothesize that given the close relationship between terrestrial venomous species and climate, a changing global environment may result in increased species migration, geographical redistribution, and longer seasons for envenomation, which would have repercussions on human health. Methods: A retrospective analysis of environmental, ecological, and medical literature was performed with a focus on climate change, toxinology, and future modeling specific to venomous terrestrial creatures. Species included venomous reptiles, snakes, arthropods, spiders, and Hymenoptera (ants and bees). Animals that are vectors of hemorrhagic infectious disease (eg, mosquitos, ticks) were excluded. Results: Our review of the literature indicates that changes to climatic norms will have a potentially dramatic effect on terrestrial venomous creatures. Empirical evidence demonstrates that geographic distributions of many species have already shifted due to changing climatic conditions. Given that most terrestrial venomous species are ectotherms closely tied to ambient temperature, and that climate change is shifting temperature zones away from the equator, further significant distribution and population changes should be anticipated. For those species able to migrate to match the changing temperatures, new geographical locations may open. For those species with limited distribution capabilities, the rate of climate change may accelerate faster than species can adapt, causing population declines. Specifically, poisonous snakes and spiders will likely maintain their population numbers but will shift their geographic distribution to traditionally temperate zones more often inhabited by humans. Fire ants and Africanized honey bees are expected to have an expanded range distribution due to predicted warming trends. Human encounters with these types of creatures are likely to increase, resulting in potential human morbidity and mortality. Conclusions: Temperature extremes and changes to climatic norms may have a dramatic effect on venomous terrestrial species. As climate change affects the distribution, populations, and life histories of these organisms, the chance of encounters could be altered, thus affecting human health and the survivability of these creatures. © 2017 Wilderness Medical Society","potential environmental and ecological effects of global climate change on","Introduction: Climate change has been scientifically documented, and its effects"

Acceptance of heads by native bees was positively correlated with the number of male-phase florets per head, although the number of approaches was not. Native bees responded to increases in nectar amounts, as determined by experiments using bagged heads in which nectar accumulated, by increasing time per head and time spent foraging per floret.

Worker bees were collected from hives located in a polluted postmining area in South West Sardinia (Italy) that is also exposed to dust emissions from industrial plants. The area is included in an official list of sites of national interest for environmental remediation, and has been characterized for the effects of pollutants on the health of the resident population. The head, wings, hind legs and alimentary canal of the bees were investigated with Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Xray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX).

We assessed the importance of climatic factors and geographic gradients on the distribution of orchid bees in a severely-fragmented and species-rich tropical forest region in Brazil. Orchid-bee males were attracted to 17 different scent baits and collected in 15 forest sites. In total we captured 11,081 bees from 40 species. Climatic variables explained twice as much of the observed variation in the bee species data set as did pure spatial variation. However, most of the climatic explained variation was spatially structured, indicating that the species and the climatic data have a similar spatial arrangement. In fact, part of the observed latitudinal changes in community composition appears to be explained by a concomitant gradient in precipitation seasonality. Similarly, reduced temperatures and a more seasonal precipitation may help to explain the relative distinctiveness of the fauna from some of the westernmost sites. The level of similarity among the sampled sites, although highly variable, decayed both as function of the climatic and geographic distances among these sites. The greatest pairwise dissimilarities in the composition of the orchid-bee fauna were observed among sites 200-300 km from each other, since in many case those sites were more dissimilar in terms of climate than those further apart.

In addition, research so far has focused on the landscape impacts on bees sampled in cropped fields while the landscape effects on bees inhabiting seminatural habitats are understudied. Here, we investigate the impact of the landscape on wild bee assemblages in 66 phryganic (low scrubland) communities on 8 Aegean islands. We computed landscape metrics (total area and total perimeter-area ratio) in 4 concentric circles (250, 500, 750, and 1000 m) around the center of each bee sampling site including 3 habitat groups (namely phrygana, cultivated land, and natural forests). We further measured the local flower cover in 25 quadrats distributed randomly at the center of each sampling site. We found that the landscape scale is more important than the local scale in shaping abundance and species richness of bees. Furthermore, habitat configuration was more important than the total area of habitats, probably because it affects bees' movement across the landscape. Phrygana and natural forests had a positive effect on bee demographics, while cultivated land had a negative effect. This demonstrates that phryganic specialists drive bee assemblages in these seminatural landscapes.

They are also dependent on forested environments which are essential to maintaining their diversity and pollination services. We analysed bee diversity in forest patches and adjacent open areas to evaluate if bees can use complementary environments in heterogeneous altered tropical landscapes. The effect of landscape level heterogeneity and forest amount on bee diversity was also assessed. Our hypothesis was that bee communities will be richer and more diverse in highly forested and heterogeneous landscapes when compared to areas dominated by few human-made environments, but due to supplementary foraging behaviors, they will be more abundant in open areas where flower availability is higher. We actively sampled bees visiting flowers within forest patches and in surrounding open areas between the Cantareira and Mantiqueira mountain ranges in São Paulo, Brazil. We found both higher bee richness and diversity in open areas than in forest patches, partially denying our initial hypothesis but supporting that bees are more abundant in open areas. We found strong indication that landscapes with a higher amount of forest and environmental heterogeneity can provide more resources for bees through resource complementation processes, maintaining their diversity in the landscape. The presence of forest patches close to crop and open areas is of utmost importance for the conservation of bees and pollination services with important consequences for land management in tropical environments. © 2018 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

Workers often join neighboring colonies by drifting, but long-range drifting (dispersal) to colonies far away from the maternal nests also rarely occurs. We tested the impact of queenstate and taxon of mother and host colonies on drifting and dispersing of workers and on the hosting of these workers in A. m. capensis, A. m. scutellata, and their natural hybrids. Workers were paint-marked according to colony and reintroduced into their queenright or queenless mother colonies. After 10 days, 579 out of 12,034 labeled workers were recaptured in foreign colonies. We found that drifting and dispersing represent different behaviors, which were differently affected by taxon and queenstate of both mother and host colonies. Hybrid workers drifted more often than A. m. capensis and A. m. scutellata. However, A. m. capensis workers dispersed more often than A. m. scutellata and the hybrids combined, and A. m. scutellata workers also dispersed more frequently than the hybrids. Dispersers from queenright A. m. capensis colonies were more often found in queenless host colonies and vice versa, indicating active host searching and/or a queenstate-discriminating guarding mechanism. Our data show that A. m. capensis workers disperse significantly more often than other races of A. mellifera, suggesting that dispersing represents a host finding mechanism. The lack of dispersal in hybrids and different hosting mechanisms of foreign workers by hybrid colonies may also be responsible for the stability of the natural hybrid zone between A. m. capensis and A. m. scutellata.","social parasitism by honeybee workers (apis mellifera capensis escholtz): host","We studied possible host finding and resistance mechanisms of host"

Twenty social parasitic workers were sampled from both of two infested A. m. scutellata colonies at two distant apiaries (Graskop and Heilbronn, about 390 km apart) and compared with data obtained from 80 colonies in four different geographical zones (zone 1: thelytokous A. m. capensis morphocluster; zone It: natural thelytokous hybrids between A. m. capensis and A. m. scutellata; zone III: thelytokous A. rn. scutellata morphocluster; zone IV: an arrhenotokous A. rn. scutellata morphocluster). Thelytokous laying workers occur naturally in zones I-III. Highly significant morphometric differences were found among the bees in the four zones. The data support the conclusion that the social parasitic workers belong to the thelytokous A. rn. capensis morphocluster. It is most likely that the social parasitic workers originated from the heart of the Cape bee's distribution range in the Western Cape region in zone 1. Morphometric analysis makes it feasible to restrict the possible origin of the social parasitic workers from the natural distribution range of thelytoky (approximately 240 000 km(2)) down to about 12 000 km(2), which represents a resolution capacity of about 95%.","parasitic cape bees in the northern regions of south africa:","Multivariate discriminant analyses of nine standard morphometric characters of honeybee"

The number of bees entering a foraging arena was positively correlated with food sucrose concentration (0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 5 M sucrose, equal to 16-65% w/w). Foragers spent significantly more time imbibing higher concentration solutions. Foragers then returned to the nest where they moved in elaborate paths at variable speeds. There was no significant effect of sucrose concentration on average forager velocity or time spent inside the nest.

Planning effective enhancements can be informed with pollination service models, but these models should capture the behavioural and spatial dynamics of service-providing organisms. Model predictions, and hence management recommendations, are likely to be sensitive to these dynamics. We used two established models of pollinator foraging to investigate whether habitat enhancement improves crop visitation; whether this effect is influenced by pollinator foraging distance and landscape pattern; and whether behavioural detail improves model predictions. The more detailed central place foraging model better predicted variation in bee visitation observed between habitat types, because it includes optimized trade-offs between patch quality and distance. Both models performed well when predicting visitation rates across broader scales. Using real agricultural landscapes and simulating habitat enhancements, we show that additional floral resources can have diverging effects on predicted crop visitation. When only co-flowering resources were added, optimally foraging bees concentrated in enhancements to the detriment of crop pollination. For both models, adding nesting resources increased crop visitation. Finally, the marginal effect of enhancements was greater in simple landscapes. Synthesis and applications. Model results help to identify the conditions under which habitat enhancements are most likely to increase pollination services in agriculture. Three design principles for pollinator habitat enhancement emerge: (a) enhancing only flowers can diminish services by distracting pollinators away from crops, (b) providing nesting resources is more likely to increase bee populations and crop visitation and (c) the benefit of enhancements will be greatest in landscapes that do not already contain abundant habitat. © 2019 The Authors.

Correspondingly, the worker bee developed numerous complicated olfactory sensilla in antennae for detection of these colony chemical signals and nectar/pollen signals in foraging. With the normal development of new emerged workers, young adults (nurse bee) worked in colony at the first 2–3 weeks and then followed by the foraging activity outside of the hive, which give rise to great change of the surrounding chemical signals. However, the olfactory adaption mechanism of worker bee in these processes of behavioral development is still unclear. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of gene expression in Apis mellifera antenna of newly emerged workers, nurses and foragers using transcriptome analysis. Meanwhile, we constructed experimental colonies to collect age-matched samples, which were used to determine whether task is the principal determinant of differential expression. RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that 6 and 14 genes were closely associated with nurse and forager behaviors, respectively. Furthermore, a broad dynamic range of chemosensory gene families and candidate odorant degrading enzymes were analyzed at different behavior statuses. We firstly reported genes associated with nursing/foraging behavior from antennae and the variations of expression of genes belonging to various olfactory gene families at different development stages.

Early work suggested that some species of stingless bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponini) may use interceptive olfactory eavesdropping to discover food sources being exploited by competitors, but it is not clear if any stingless bee can be attracted to the odour marks deposited by an interspecific competitor. We show that foragers of the aggressive meliponine bee, Trigona spinipes, can detect and orient towards odour marks deposited by a competitor, Melipona rufiventris, and then rapidly take over the food source, driving away or killing their competitors. When searching for food sources at new locations that they are not already exploiting, T. spinipes foragers strongly prefer M. rufiventris odour marks to odour marks deposited by their own nest-mates, whereas they prefer nest-mate odour marks over M. rufiventris odour marks at a location already occupied by T. spinipes nest-mates. Melipona rufiventris foragers flee from T. spinipes odour marks. This olfactory eavesdropping may have played a role in the evolution of potentially cryptic communication mechanisms such as shortened odour trails, point-source only odour marking and functionally referential communication concealed at the nest.","olfactory eavesdropping by a competitively foraging stingless bee, trigona spinipes","Signals that are perceived over long distances or leave extended"

We therefore trained marked foragers of two species, Melipona mandacaia and M. bicolor, to feeders at different distances and to different sucrose concentrations at the same distance. In both species, foragers successfully recruited to a rich 2.5-M food source and produced pulsed recruitment sounds in which pulse duration was significantly and positively correlated with distance to the rich food source. When returning from poorer food sources (0.6-1.5 M), foragers of both species decreased sound production, producing shorter sound pulses and longer sound interpulses than they did for 2.5 M food located at the same distance. Thus the temporal structure of M. mandacaia and M. bicolor recruitment sounds varies with distance and food quality. However, nestmates were not recruited by performances for poorer food sources (0.6-1.5 M), whose sucrose concentration was sufficiently low to affect recruitment sounds. Surprisingly, the interphase (the time between behavioral phases that communicate location) also increases with decreasing food quality in the closely related honeybees (Apis), suggesting a potential homology in the effect of food quality on the recruitment systems of Apis and Melipona.

Among animals, stingless bees exhibit the unique behavior of depositing long substrate-borne odor trails that assist the orientation of flying nestmates to a specific three-dimensional food location. However, relatively little is known about the spatial structure of such odor trails, particularly vertical trails, and whether these trails are polarized to indicate the correct terminus. We show that a stingless bee, Trigona spinipes, can rapidly recruit nest-mates in large bursts to a food source at a specific distance, direction, and height. In conjunction with a major recruitment burst, foragers deposited odor marks that attracted nestmates for up to 20 min. Surprisingly, these odor marks formed a short odor trail instead of a complete odor trail extending from the feeder to the nest (the classic description of a meliponine odor trail). The length of the odor trails varied between different feeder locations with different colonies, from a minimum of 3 m to a maximum of 29 m. The odor marks formed a polarized trail that newcomers followed to the end with the most concentrated odor marks (the feeder), even when the entire odor trail was rotated 180° and clean test feeders were set out at locations that foragers had never previously fed at. Thus locale odor or the potential communication of food location inside the nest do not account for the ability of newcomers to find the correct terminus.

We provide the first detailed data showing that this phenomenon also occurs in the closely related bumble bee and thus may be homologous in all social bees of the Apidae. Using infrared thermography, we measured Tth for Bombus wilmattae foragers (mass 0.17±0.11 g, length 15.0±1.5 mm) from six wild colonies, foraging on a range of sucrose concentrations (0.5-2.5 mol l -1, 16-65% by mass) in foraging arenas. For all colonies, we measured significant increases in ΔTth (P&lt;0.0001) with increasing sucrose concentration, with significant differences (P&lt;0.0001) between colonies due to different linear regression slopes (0.28-2.4) and y-intercepts (2.7-5.5).

The feeders were positioned to test the communication of each dimension The results show that recruits do not simply follow experienced foragers to the food source. Height and distance are communicated within the nest, while direction is communicated outside the nest. We then examined the pulsed sounds produced by recruiting foragers. While unloading food, recruiting foragers produced several short pulses and one or more very long pulses. On average, the longest unloading pulse per performance was 31-50% longer (P ≤ 0.018) for bees foraging on the forest floor than for bees foraging at the top of the forest canopy (40 m high). While dancing, recruiting foragers produced sound pulses whose duration was positively correlated with the distance to the food source (P < 0.001).

Yet the third dimension, height above ground, may be significant in the tall and dense forest habitats of stingless bees. Foragers of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona postica recruit to a specific three-dimensional location by laying a scent trail. Stingless bees in the genus Melipona are thought to have a more sophisticated recruitment system that communicates distance through sounds inside the nest and direction through pointing zig-zag flights outside the nest. However, prior research on Melipona has not examined height communication or even established that foragers can recruit newcomers to a specific location. We used identical paired feeders to investigate recruitment to food in M panamica on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We trained foragers from an observation hive to one feeder and monitored both feeders for the subsequent arrival of newcomers. We changed the relative positions of the feeders to test for correct direction, distance, and canopy-level communication. A 40-m canopy tower located inside the forest enabled us to examine canopy-level communication. We found that M. panamica foragers can recruit to a specific (1) direction, (2) distance, and (3) canopy level. To test the possibility that foragers accomplish this by means of a scent trail, we placed the colony on one shore of a small cove and trained bees over 116 m of open water to a feeder located on the opposite shore. We also placed a second feeder on this shore, equidistant from the colony but 20 m from the first feeder. Significantly more newcomers consistently arrived at the feeder visited by the foragers. Thus foragers evidently do not need a scent trail to communicate direction. Inside the nest, a forager produces pulsed sounds while visibly vibrating her wings after returning from a good food source. She is attended by other bees who cluster and hold their antennae around her, following her as she rapidly spins clockwise and counterclockwise. Locational information may be encoded in this behavior. However, foragers may also directly lead newcomers to the food source.

We therefore examined the spatial communication abilities of a putatively primitive stingless bee, Trigona carbonaria. We trained foragers to one feeder (the experimental feeder) and set out an array of identical control feeders to test the communication of direction and distance. Recruits could find the food source at the correct direction, but this was influenced by orientation to food odor and a favorable wind direction. In trials with scented feeders, significantly more newcomers (71%) arrived in the correct direction when the experimental feeder was directly upwind from the nest. When the experimental feeder was downwind from the nest, a non-significant majority of newcomers (51%) arrived at the experimental feeder. However, orientation to food odor is not essential, since significantly more newcomers arrived at the experimental feeder in the unscented direction trial with rapid recruitment (50 newcomers/hours, 195 forager visits per hour). Experienced foragers did not appear to communicate distance because newcomers (61%) generally preferred the closest feeder to the nest, even in the unscented distance experiments. Overall, our results suggest that recruits can orient to the scent of the food source and may also orient to a forager-deposited pheromone at the food source or follow experienced foragers for part of the distance to the food source. © by Urban & Fischer Verlag.","the communication of food location by a primitive stingless bee,","Summary The stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponinae) reportedly possess communication"

We therefore investigated how group size affects the aggression levels and the spatio-temporal attack strategy (which body parts, and the amount of time spent in attacking each part) in close combats between Trigona spinipes foragers and a natural competitor, Melipona rufiventris. In all trials, T spinipes foragers competitively excluded M rufiventris foragers from nearby feeders, exhibiting four levels of aggressive behavior ranging from threat displays to prolonged grappling and decapitation. Surprisingly, aggression levels and spatial strategy corresponded to the size of group attacks. Larger groups of attackers used individually lower aggression levels than small groups of attackers. Smaller groups also attacked appendages linked to escape (legs and wings) with greater frequency than larger groups, which focused on vital central body areas (abdomen, thorax, and head). Increased aggression corresponded to increased risks for attackers and the attacked. All combatants engaging at the highest level of aggression died (100% mortality).

In particular we tested the hypothesis that the composition of the flower visitor community in terms of visitation frequencies by different pollinator groups were affected by the spatial plant population structure, viz. area and density measures, at a within-population ('patch') and among-population ('population') scale. We found that patch area and population density were the spatial variables that best explained the variation in visitation frequencies within the pollinator community. Honeybees had higher visitation frequencies in larger patches, while bumblebees and hoverflies had higher visitation frequencies in sparser populations. Solitary bees had higher visitation frequencies in sparser populations and smaller patches. We also tested the hypothesis that honeybees affect the composition of the pollinator community by altering the visitation frequencies of other groups of pollinators. There was a positive relationship between visitation frequencies of honeybees and bumblebees, while the relationship with hoverflies and solitary bees varied (positive, negative and no relationship) depending on the plant species under study. The overall conclusion is that the spatial structure of plant populations affects different groups of pollinators in contrasting ways at both the local ('patch') and the larger ('population') scales and, that honeybees affect the flower visitation by other pollinator groups in various ways, depending on the plant species under study. These contrasting responses emphasize the need to investigate the entire pollinator community when the effects of landscape change on plant-pollinator interactions are studied.","pollinator community responses to the spatial population structure of wild","Land-use changes can alter the spatial population structure of plant"

However, museums specimens also contain important ecological information, including rarely measured morphological traits. Trait-based assessments of museums specimens provide additional information on underlying mechanisms of population trends, by tracking changes over time. Here, we used museum specimens of four Bombus species, spanning a timeframe of 125 years to: (i) compare body size of declining and increasing species, (ii) assess intra-specific trends over the last century, and (iii) investigate shifts in geographical distribution over time. We found that declining Bombus species were larger than increasing ones. All four species were smaller in current time than a century ago. Intra-specific size declines were more pronounced for larger-bodied species. With our sampling, declining and increasing species showed an upward shift in elevation, and declining species showed an additional geographic shift in recent times as compared to historic records.

The objective of this field experiment was to use a synchrony index, which is an estimate of flower receptivity and pollination timing synchrony, to relate variation in seed yield to number of open flowers and foraging honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) density. Transparent floating crop-cover and shade cloth were used to alter flower number and flower phenology. The soil type was Amity silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Argiaquic Xeric Argialboll). Cumulated open flowers and cumulated foraging bee density were derived from daily counts of flowers and foraging honey bees, respectively. Flower receptivity for each day was estimated using maximum air temperature for that day. Number of receptive flowers for each day was multiplied by the number of foraging bees for that day and summed for the bloom period to form cumulated synchrony index. A multiple regression model (R2 = 0.47, P < 0.001) indicated a linear positive association of seeds per flower with cumulated foraging bee density, and a quadratic negative (within the experiment range) association with cumulated open flowers. A simple linear regression explained 87% (P < 0.001) of the variation in seed number per area by difference in cumulated synchrony index.

Many external cues which could be used by the spiders change dramatically or disappear altogether in the transition period from day to night. Hence, it is therefore imperative to know exactly when after sunset the spiders navigate in order to find out how they do it. To explore this question, we monitored their locomotor activity with data loggers equipped with infrared beam sensors. Our results show that the male spiders are most active in the period between the end and the beginning of the astronomical twilight period. Moreover, they prefer the moonless, i.e. darkest times at night. Hence, we conclude that the males are truly - and extremely - nocturnal.

Also, we estimated the locations of additional baboon groups relative to the study group. Routes were less linear, travel speed was higher, and inter-resource distances were larger when other groups were present within 500 m of the focal group; thus, the study group avoided others by taking detours. We predicted that evasive manoeuvres would be characteristic of different possible orientation mechanisms, and compared them with our observations. We analysed 34 evasive manoeuvres in detail. In an area that lacked prominent landmarks, detours were small; larger detours occurred when resources were directly visible, or in the vicinity of a hill offering conspicuous landmarks. In areas without prominent landmarks, detours were along familiar routes and waiting bouts of up to 60 min occurred; on one occasion the study group aborted their entire day's journey. We discuss these findings in the light of time and energy costs and suggest that the baboons lack the ability to compute Euclidean relations among locations, but use network maps to find their way to out-of-sight locations.","mental maps in chacma baboons (papio ursinus): using inter-group encounters","Encounters between groups of wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) can"

The actions of microRNAs and Vg are known to intersect in the context of reproduction; however, the role of these associations on social behavior is unknown. The phenotypic effects of Vg knockdown are best established and studied in the forager stage of workers. Thus, we exploited the well-established RNA interference (RNAi) protocol for Vg knockdown to investigate its downstream effects on microRNA population in honey bee foragers' brain and fat body tissue. To identify microRNAs that are differentially expressed between tissues in control and knockdown foragers, we used μParaflo microfluidic oligonucleotide microRNA microarrays. Our results showed that 76 and 74 microRNAs were expressed in the brain of control and knockdown foragers whereas 66 and 69 microRNAs were expressed in the fat body of control and knockdown foragers, respectively. Target prediction identified potential seed matches for a differentially expressed subset of microRNAs affected by Vg knockdown.

If the species suffers from inbreeding depression or is self-incompatible, the number of seeds matured per fruit may be limited by the lack of outcrossing by unrelated pollen. We tested for distance-related genetic structure by hand-pollinating plants at increasing distances and measuring fruit set (berries/pollinated flowers) and seed number per fruit in natural populations of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.). Bagging of the flower buds without natural (pollination by insects) or hand-pollination yielded almost no fruit or seed, suggesting that the species are obligately insect pollinated. Self-pollination led to a significant reduction in seed number per fruit and increased seed abortion compared with cross-pollination. Moreover, seed number increased with increasing distance between the pollen donor and pollen recipient. Flight distances of bumblebees were estimated for bilberry by monitoring between-flower and, for lingonberry, between-inflorescence flight distances. About 90% of all flights were at distances of less than 1 m. At this distance, we observed less than the maximum seed number per fruit in hand-pollinations in both study species.

Despite the threat to pollination posed by tropical deforestation, it remains an understudied process. In particular, little is known about these dynamics in multi-paternal, successional plant species whose fruits can contain substantial genetic diversity. Given the importance of successional plants in reforestation, quantifying the factors that impact their reproduction is essential for understanding plant gene flow in the context of global change. In this study, we investigated pollen-mediated gene flow at the multi-paternal fruit level to quantify how tropical pollinators navigate and mediate gene flow in altered forests. Utilizing microsatellite genotyping and paternity analyses, we revealed that distinct plant neighborhood and individual factors drive pollen dispersal at the intra-fruit scale. Variance in pollen dispersal distances was greater for neighborhoods with higher conspecific density, indicating that density dependent reproductive patterns play a role at this scale. Additionally, both the diversity and evenness of sires mediated by a single pollinator were affected by the size of the mother tree, that is, larger mothers received pollen from a less diverse, less even pool of sires per fruit. Pollinator body size was not found to be a significant driver of pollen dispersal, indicating that both small- and large-bodied pollinators were equally important pollen dispersers at this scale. By exploring patterns of variation at the intra-fruit level, we show that conspecific density and tree size significantly impact multi-paternal pollen-mediated gene flow, reinforcing the importance of investigating intraspecific, intra-individual variance in plant reproduction. © 2018 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","bee movement across heterogeneous tropical forests: multi-paternal analyses reveal the","Animal pollination is critical for maintaining the reproduction and genetic"

Counts of nest-searching queens in spring and early summer have been used as an indication of preferred nesting habitat, but this relationship has not yet been validated; high densities of nest-searching queens may indicate habitat with few nesting opportunities (meaning that queens have to spend longer looking for them). 2. From mid April 2010, queen bumblebees were counted along 20 transects in grassland and woodland habitats in central Scotland, U.K. The number of inflorescences of suitable forage plants were also estimated at each transect visit. The area surrounding each transect was searched for nests in the summer. 3. In total, 173 queen bumblebees were recorded on transects, and, of these, 149 were engaged in nest-searching. Searches subsequently revealed 33 bumblebee nests. 4. The number of nest-searching queens on transects was significantly, positively related to the number of nests subsequently found. Estimated floral abundance along the transect did not correlate with numbers of nest-searching queens or with the number of nests found, suggesting that queens do not target their searching to areas that are locally high in spring forage. 5.

The efficiency of a dog compared with human volunteers at finding nests in woodland, with the human volunteers using two methods: 'fixed searches' and 'free searches'. The two dogs varied in their efficiency in finding buried portions of bumble bee nest material (62.5% and 100% correct indications). Searching for real nests in rural habitats, a detection dog located nine nests of four bumble bee species, in a range of habitats, at a rate of one nest for 19 h 24 min of searching time. A comparison of ` free searches' using human volunteers and the dog in woodland found that they located nests at similar rates, one nest for 1 h 20 min of searching time. Fixed searches located nests more slowly (one nest for 3 h 18 min of searching time), but probably provide a reliable estimate of nest density. Experienced volunteers performed no better than novices. Given the investment required to train and maintain a detection dog, we conclude that this is not a cost effective method for locating bumble bee nests. If the aim is to estimate density, then fixed searches are appropriate, whereas if the aim is to find many nests, free searches using volunteers provide the most cost effective method.","humans versus dogs; a comparison of methods for the detection","This study investigates alternative approaches to locating bumble bee nests"

Although potential insect prey are abundant in ape habitats, patterns of insectivory are not consistent across species or populations. Efforts to understand these patterns are complicated by a lack of nutritional data. We collected samples of insects consumed by the Kasekela chimpanzee community of Gombe National Park, Tanzania, as well as of some insects found within the community range and ignored by these chimpanzees but known to be preyed upon by Pan elsewhere. We determined the gross energy (GE), estimated metabolizable energy (ME), fat, protein, fiber, and ash content of these samples following standard methodologies. We use these data to test the hypothesis that Kasekela chimpanzees choose insect prey (at least in part) based on energy and/or macronutrient content. On a fresh-weight, per-gram basis, the insect prey consumed by Kasekela chimpanzees had significantly higher fat and lower ash content than other assayed insects, and on a fresh-weight, per-foraging-unit (per-insect, per-dip, or per-nest) basis were significantly higher in GE, fat, and protein. On a per-gram basis, the assayed insects were generally comparable in energy and macronutrients to wild vertebrate meat.

Red and blue flowers both influenced long-distance attractiveness of plants, defined as the number of insect approaches towards an individual plant. After reaching a plant, flower visitors preferred to visit young red flowers. Therefore, short-distance attractiveness, defined as the number of flowers visited successively on an individual plant, was influenced mainly by the number of young red flowers. The co-occurrence of the change in reproductive ability, in amount of reward, and in flower color enabled lungwort plants to direct pollinators to reproductive, highly rewarding red flowers. The data suggest that by maintaining changed flowers lungwort plants can increase their long-distance attraction and simultaneously enhance the probability of flower visits to pre-changed flowers.

In intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, many species are confined to very small uncultivated areas such as field margins. However, it has been suggested that these small habitat elements cannot support viable populations of all the species observed there. Instead, species richness and abundance in these small habitat fragments may, at least partly, be dependent on dispersal from larger semi-natural grassland fragments. 2. We tested this hypothesis for butterflies and bumble bees in 12 independent landscapes in a region of intense agriculture in southern Sweden. In each landscape we surveyed abundance and species richness in one semi-natural grassland, one linear habitat (uncultivated field margin) adjacent to this (called proximate) and one similar linear habitat (called distant) situated at least 1000 m from the semi-natural grassland patch. 3. Both species richness and density (individuals per unit area) of butterflies and bumble bees were significantly higher in proximate linear habitats than in distant ones. Moreover, butterfly species richness was higher for a given area in grasslands than in any of the linear habitat types. Butterfly density in grasslands did not differ from that in proximate linear habitats but was lower in distant linear habitats. The effect of isolation on density was stronger for less mobile butterfly species. For bumble bees there was no difference in species richness between grasslands and proximate linear habitats. 4. For at least some of the butterfly species even these relatively small fragments of semi-natural grasslands act as population sources from which individuals disperse to the surrounding habitats and thereby contribute to higher densities and species richness in adjacent areas. For bumble bees, it is more likely that the grasslands contain a higher density of nests than the surrounding intensively cultivated landscape, and that the density of foraging bumble bees decreases with increasing distance from the nest. 5. Synthesis and application. Habitat fragmentation and intensified agricultural practices are considered to be a threat against services provided by pollinators. In order to sustain the abundance and diversity of insect pollinators in intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, we suggest that preservation of the remaining semi-natural grasslands or re-creation of flower-rich grasslands is essential. © 2006 The Authors.","semi-natural grasslands as population sources for pollinating insects in agricultural","1.

We tested how connectivity, time since restoration, and species traits influence if species that are present in the surrounding landscape also occur in restored pastures. Solitary bee species present in the landscape were less likely to occur in restored pastures compared to bumblebees and hoverflies. The occurrence of bumblebees, but not solitary bees or hoverflies, decreased with time since restoration. The occurrence of solitary bees increased but the occurrence of hoverflies decreased with high connectivity. Migratory hoverflies were more likely to occur in restored pastures than nonmigratory hoverflies, especially in pastures with low connectivity. Among both bumblebees and solitary bees, the occurrence was influenced by nesting traits, with the lowest occurrence of parasitic species and of species digging nests in the ground. The subset of the landscape's species pool that occurs in restored pastures has a contrasting set of traits compared with species in intact source habitats.

The rich angiosperm diversity stems from several factors including variations in geographical distribution and floral morphology, which tend to correlate with different pollinator preference in many taxa. Pollinator diversity varies among different regions, thus range shifts can play an important role in increasing divergence by predisposing clades to floral shifts. Antirrhineae is an ideal model to examine the effect of range shifts and pollination modes on diversification, because the tribe is distributed in the Old World and the New World with representatives exhibiting hummingbird pollination in the New World, and bee pollination in the Old World and the New World. Using ancestral reconstructions and phylogenetic modeling, this study investigated the effects of geographic distribution and pollination modes on the macroevolution of the tribe Antirrhineae. Our age-range correlation analysis showed young nodes had more range overlap than older nodes in the phylogeny, suggesting sympatric speciation as a contributing factor to the diversification of the tribe. We observed similar rates of diversification throughout time with no evident rate shifts within the tribe. Old World and New World lineages have similar speciation rates in Antirrhineae, and pollination mode did not have a significant effect on the diversification of the tribe. However, we found evidence for increased diversification rates through long-distance dispersal events, which occurred between the Old World and the New World four times throughout the evolutionary history of Antirrhineae. Therefore, we conclude that long-distance dispersal was a strong contributor to the diversity within Antirrhineae. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","diversification rates in antirrhineae (plantaginaceae): the contribution of range shifts","The relationship between range and diversification is an enduring evolutionary"

Trillium tschonoskii is the most wide-ranging species among Asiatic Trillium, ranging from southern Sakhalin, the Japanese Islands (excepting Kyushu) to the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan and further to inland China and the Himalayas. The ecological range of T. tschonoskii is broad, extending from lowland forests to montane and further to subalpine mixed forests consisting of conifers and subalpine birch, Betula ermani. This species is a typical polycarpic perennial, similar to all other Japanese Trillium species, and flowers in early to late April in lowland populations and in mid-June to early July in subalpine habitats. Trillium tschonoskii typically has three white petals and three sepals, and its pollinators are diverse, for example, flies, beetles and bees such as Scatophagiae (Diptera), Oedemera lucidicollis (Coleoptera) and Andrena sp. (Hymenoptera). Pollen/ovule ratios of T. tschonoskii are approximately 700, thus T. tschonoskii is potentially an inbreeder.

The pivoting stamens of S. nipponica hinder nectar-collecting bumblebees from crawling into flowers, increasing the probing time per flower. I predicted that longer probing times would reduce the relative cost of moving between plants, causing bees to leave plants earlier. To test this prediction, I simplified S. nipponica flowers by removing the stamens from all open flowers within a 75-m2 quadrat. Bumblebees probed these flowers more quickly than intact flowers, but the stamen removal affected neither the frequency of flower revisitation nor the flight distance between plants. In response to the decrease in the probing time per flower, bees probed more flowers on these plants. Therefore, in S. nipponica, floral complexity reduces the opportunity for geitonogamous self-pollination. Stamen removal also increased bee visitation per flower, suggesting that this sort of complexity deters visitation. To keep complex flowers attractive, therefore, selection might increase floral rewards or longevity. Floral complexity might evolve in an integrative manner with the rest of the floral phenotype.","consequences of floral complexity for bumblebee-mediated geitonogamous self-pollination in salvia","I address how floral complexity influences geitonogamous self-pollination through manipulation"

Past experiments have shown that bumble bees cannot always develop accurate (i.e., repeatable) traplines to a sufficient level, despite their economic advantages in many situations. The bees' preference for short flights works against developing accurate traplines when plants or patches are distributed in zigzag fashion. How should bees cope with such situations in nature? We conducted laboratory experiments with artificial flowers to test 2 nonexclusive hypotheses: bees may travel faster to compensate for low traplining accuracy, and when local landmarks are available, bees may be able to develop traplines by remembering external spatial information in addition to the locations of flowers. As predicted, foragers on a zigzag-shaped floral array traveled faster, with lower route repeatability, than those on a triangular lattice where distance and angle could be chosen independently, suggesting that bees trade-off accuracy for speed when it is more feasible. In contrast, bees traveled more slowly with unchanged traplining accuracy when landmarks were added into both arrays, possibly because the landmarks caused information load or visual distraction. Finally, bees on the zigzag array with additional landmarks made a quicker decision to switch from accurate traplining to fast traveling. If landmarks helped the bees to grasp the overall array geometry in our experiments, they may also permit bees in nature to select a distribution of plants or patches that aids accurate traplining. © 2012 The Author.","trapline foraging by bumble bees: vi. behavioral alterations under speed-accuracy","Trapline foraging (repeated sequential visits to a series of feeding"

Although field studies on bumble-bees and hummingbirds have clarified fundamental aspects of this behaviour, trapline foraging still poses several difficult questions from the perspectives of both animals and plants. These questions include whether and how traplining improves foraging performance, how animals develop traplines with accumulating foraging experience, and how traplining affects pollen flow or plant reproduction. Scope First, we review our previous work performed by using computer simulations and indoor flight-cage experiments with bumble-bees foraging from arrays of automated feeders. Our findings include the following: (1) traplining benefits foragers that are competing for resources that replenish in a decelerating way, (2) traplining is a learned behaviour that develops over a period of hours and (3) the establishment of traplines could be hampered by spatial configuration of plants such as zigzags. Second, using a simulation model linking pollinator movement and pollen transfer, we consider how service by pollinators with different foraging patterns (searchers or trapliners) would affect pollen flow. Traplining increases mating distance and mate diversity, and reduces 'iterogamy' (self-pollination caused by return visits) at the population level. Furthermore, increased visitation rates can have opposite effects on the reproductive success of a plant, depending on whether the visitors are traplining or searching. Finally, we discuss possible consequences of traplining for plants in the light of new experimental work and modelling. Conclusions We suggest that trapline foraging by pollinators increases variation among plant populations in genetic diversity, inbreeding depression and contributions of floral traits to plant fitness, which should in turn affect the rates and directions of floral evolution. More theoretical and empirical studies are needed to clarify possible outcomes of such a neglected side of pollination. © 2009 The Author.","trapline foraging by pollinators: its ontogeny, economics and possible consequences","Background Trapline foraging (repeated sequential visits to a series of"

What can flower visitors such as bees do to optimize their foraging routes, that is, reduce return time or route distance? Some repeatedly visit a set of plants in a significantly predictable sequence (so-called ""trapline foraging""), which may also enhance their foraging efficiency. A moderate level of optimization and repetition of foraging routes can be reached by following simple movement rules for choosing the distances and turning angles of successive flights, without the use of spatial memory. If pollinators can learn the locations of patches and choose among possible foraging routes or paths, however, even better performance may be achieved. We tested whether and how bumble bees can optimize and repeat their foraging routes in laboratory experiments with artificial flowers that secreted nectar at a constant rate. With increasing experience, foraging routes of bees became more repeatable and efficient than expected from a combination of simple movement rules between successive flowers. We suggest that trapline foraging is a more sophisticated pattern of spatial use than searching and is based on memory. On the other hand, certain spatial configurations of flowers hampered optimization by the bees; bees preferred to choose short distances over straight moves and showed little plasticity in this regard. Developing an efficient trapline, therefore, may require prior selection of a set of plants with an appropriate spatial configuration. © The Author 2006.

Consequently, the colony achieves an effective collection of food. However, it is still not fully understood how much effect the dance behavior has on the food collection, because most of the relevant experiments have been performed only in limited locations under limited experimental conditions. Here, we examined the efficacy of the waggle dances by physically preventing bees from dancing and then analyzing the changes in daily mass of the hive as an index of daily food collection. To eliminate place- and year-specific effects, the experiments were performed under fully natural conditions in three different cities in Japan from mid September to early October in three different years. Because the experiments were performed in autumn, all six of the tested colonies lost mass on most of the experimental days. When the dance was prevented, the daily reduction in mass change was greater than when the dance was allowed, i.e. the dance inhibited the reduction of the hive mass. This indicates that dance is effective for food collection. Furthermore, clear inhibition was observed on the first two days of the experiments; after that, inhibition was no longer evident.

Video analysis showed that the bee does not dance in a single or random place in the hive but waggled several times in one place and then several times in another. It also showed that the information of the waggle dance contains a substantial margin of error. Angle and duration of waggle runs varied from run to run, with the range of ±15° and ±15%, respectively, even in a series of waggle dances of a single individual. We also found that most dance followers that listen to the waggle dance left the dancer after one or two sessions of listening. © 2008 Akadémiai Kiadó.","the dance of the honeybee: how do honeybees dance to","A honeybee informs her nestmates of the location of a"

Here, we apply a decision framework, specifically developed to identify and prioritise climate change adaptation actions and demonstrate its use for 30 species threatened in the UK. Our aim is to assess whether government conservation recommendations remain appropriate under a changing climate. The species, associated with three different habitats (lowland heath, broadleaved woodland and calcareous grassland), were selected from a range of taxonomic groups (primarily moths and vascular plants, but also including bees, bryophytes, carabid beetles and spiders). We compare the actions identified for these threatened species by the decision framework with those included in existing conservation plans, as developed by the UK Government's statutory adviser on nature conservation. We find that many existing conservation recommendations are also identified by the decision framework. However, there are large differences in the spatial prioritisation of actions when explicitly considering projected climate change impacts. This includes recommendations for actions to be carried out in areas where species do not currently occur, in order to allow them to track movement of suitable conditions for their survival. Uncertainties in climate change projections are not a reason to ignore them. Our results suggest that existing conservation plans, which do not take into account potential changes in suitable climatic conditions for species, may fail to maximise species persistence. Comparisons across species also suggest a more habitat-focused approach could be adopted to enable climate change adaptation for multiple species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent concerns about the declines of both domestic and wild bees, calls for measures to promote wild pollinator populations in farmland. However, to be able to efficiently promote and prioritize between measures that benefit pollinators, such as modified land use, agri-environment schemes, or specific conservation measures, it is important to have a tool that accurately predicts how bees use landscapes and respond to such measures. In this paper we compare an existing model for predicting pollination (the ""Lonsdorf model""), with an extension of a general model for habitat use of central place foragers (the ""CPF model""). The Lonsdorf model has been shown to perform relatively well in simple landscapes, but not in complex landscapes. We hypothesized that this was because it lacks a behavioral component, assuming instead that bees in essence diffuse out from the nest into the landscape. By adding a behavioral component, the CPF model in contrast assumes that bees only use those parts of the landscape that enhances their fitness, completely avoiding foraging in other parts of the landscape. Because foraging is directed toward the most rewarding foraging habitat patches as determined by quality and distance, foraging habitat will include a wide range of forage qualities close to the nest, but a much narrower range farther away. We generate predictions for both simple and complex hypothetical landscapes, to illustrate the effect of including the behavioral rule, and for real landscapes. In the real landscapes the models give similar predictions for visitation rates in simple landscapes, but more different predictions in heterogeneous landscapes. We also analyze the consequences of introducing hedgerows near a mass-flowering crop field under each model. The Lonsdorf model predicts that any habitat improvement will enhance pollination of the crop. In contrast, the CPF model predicts that the hedgerow must provide good nesting sites, and not just foraging opportunities, for it to benefit pollination of the crop, because good forage quality alone may drain bees away from the field. Our model can be used to optimize pollinator mitigation measures in real landscapes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","modeling pollinating bee visitation rates in heterogeneous landscapes from foraging","Pollination by bees is important for food production.

We examined the route-choice behavior of foraging honeybees when they encountered a barrier which could be traversed by flying through one of two apertures, positioned side by side. When the bees’ choice behavior was averaged over the entire tested population, the two apertures were chosen with equal frequency when they were equally wide. When the apertures were of different width, the bees, on average, showed a preference for the wider aperture, which increased sharply with the difference between the aperture widths. Thus, bees are able to discriminate the widths of oncoming gaps and choose the passage which is presumably safer and quicker to transit. Examination of the behavior of individual bees revealed that, when the two apertures were equally wide, ca. 55% of the bees displayed no side bias in their choices. However, the remaining 45% showed varying degrees of bias, with one half of them preferring the left-hand aperture, and the other half the right-hand aperture. The existence of distinct individual biases was confirmed by measuring the times required by biased bees to transit various aperture configurations: The transit time was longer if a bee’s intrinsic bias forced it to engage with the narrower aperture. Our results show that, at the population level, bees do not exhibit ‘handedness’ in choosing routes; however, individual bees display an idiosyncratic bias that can range from a strong left bias, through zero bias, to a strong right bias. In honeybees, previous studies of olfactory and visual learning have demonstrated clear biases at the population level. To our knowledge, our study is the first to uncover the existence of individually distinct biases in honeybees. We also show how a distribution of biases among individual honeybees can be advantageous in facilitating rapid transit of a group of bees through a cluttered environment, without any centralized decision-making or control. © 2017 Ong et al.

Using microsatellite markers, we assessed historical gene flow by the quantification of regional-scale genetic structure and isolation by distance among 18 populations, and contemporary gene flow by the estimation of recent migration rates among populations. To assess bee-mediated pollen dispersal on a smaller scale, we conducted paternity analyses within a focal population, and quantified within-population spatial genetic structure in four populations. Gene flow was limited to certain nearby populations within continuous forest blocks, whereas drift appeared to dominate on larger scales. Limited long-distance gene flow was supported by within-population patterns; gene flow was biased towards nearby plants, and significant small-scale spatial genetic structure was detected within populations.

We genotyped 57 female bees and found significant and geographically consistent variation in allelic diversity and heterozygosity between populations.

Under certain environmental conditions asexual reproduction is predominant, which generates ecological consequences on sexual fecundity. In this context, we studied the reproductive ecology of the creeping clonal cactus Echinopsis thelegona in La Bodega (Salta, Argentina), where low fruit and seed production was preliminarily observed. Specifically, we studied the flower availability, fruit and seed production, reproductive system, floral visitors and effects of neighbor ramets on reproductive success. The number of available flowers per day was low, and fruit production was low or null as well. Echinopsis thelegona is self-incompatible. Although its flowers have sphingophilous traits, we did not find evidence of moths visiting them. Only native and exotic bees visited the flowers of this species, though with a low number of visits. Therefore, nocturnal visitors were not registered as pollinators of E. thelegona, perhaps because of their low local abundances. On the other hand, bees behaved as inefficient pollinators of E. thelegona due to their foraging behavior, which moves pollen within individuals. A pollen-addition experiment revealed that there is no fruit production at short distances among ramets. Therefore, the combination of self-incompatibility, low flower production and low local abundance of pollinators could account for the low fruit production observed in this species. This finding suggests that populations of E. thelegona persist by clonality and that they tend toward the loss of sexuality. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.","extremely reduced sexual reproduction in the clonal cactus echinopsis thelegona","Sexual and asexual reproduction may occur simultaneously in some plant"

In the present study, spiders were trained to walk over a black-and-white grating and afterwards tested either over a white substratum, the same substratum used for training or the same substratum rotated 90deg (two groups: ALEs covered and only ALEs uncovered; they were tested first without their eyes covered and then with their eyes covered).

Under the white or the same substratum in test conditions, the directional bearing had the same mean direction and a distribution similar to that of the training sessions. When the substratum was rotated 90deg, the directional bearing had the same mean direction but the distribution was significantly different from that of the training sessions. Moreover, if ALEs were covered, spiders behaved as if the substratum had not been rotated and the directional bearing distribution was similar to that of the training sessions. But, if ALEs were the only eyes uncovered, spiders behaved as if no eyes were covered and directional bearing distribution was similar to that of the test condition. It is suggested that, when homing, L. tarantula uses both idiothetic information and visual information gathered through ALEs.

Outward tracks had a mean length of 275.3 ± 18.5m (n = 65) and a range of 70-631 m, and were often to forage destinations beyond the nearest available forage. Most bees were constant to compass bearing and destination over successive trips, although one bee was tracked apparently switching between forage patches.

Social bees provide a good model for this and, whilst there are published descriptions of their behaviour on initial learning flights close to the colony, it is still unclear how bees find floral resources over hundreds of metres and how these flights become directed foraging trips. We investigated the spatial ecology of exploration by radar tracking bumblebees, and comparing the flight trajectories of bees with differing experience. The bees left the colony within a day or two of eclosion and flew in complex loops of ever-increasing size around the colony, exhibiting Lévy-flight characteristics constituting an optimal searching strategy. This mathematical pattern can be used to predict how animals exploring individually might exploit a patchy landscape. The bees' groundspeed, maximum displacement from the nest and total distance travelled on a trip increased significantly with experience. More experienced bees flew direct paths, predominantly flying upwind on their outward trips although forage was available in all directions. The flights differed from those of naïve honeybees: they occurred at an earlier age, showed more complex looping, and resulted in earlier returns of pollen to the colony.

The objectives were to investigate whether pollen flow and consequent gene flow reflected bee patch constancy and how pollen flow varied with distance and vegetation between donor and recipient plants. Groups of five clover plants were positioned on grass/herb patches, sown within a field of barley. Each group of plants contained one clover line. Seed paternity in three cohorts of inflorescences was determined using starch gel electrophoresis. Most (92%) of the sampled seed was sired by plants from the same group as the recipient plant. There was a significant negative relationship between pollen flow and distance between plant groups, and pollen flow declined significantly over time. There was some evidence that a strip of barley between the grass/herb patches acted as a barrier to pollen flow.

Bumblebees provide an important pollination service to both crops and wild plants. Many species have declined in the UK, particularly in arable regions. While bumblebee forage requirements have been widely studied, there has been less consideration of whether availability of nesting sites is limiting. It is important to know which habitats contain the most bumblebee nests per unit area in order to guide conservation and management options; particularly in the light of current emphasis on environmental stewardship schemes for farmed landscapes. However, it is extremely difficult to map the distribution of bumblebee nests. 2. We describe the findings of the National Bumblebee Nest Survey, a structured survey carried out by 719 volunteers in the UK during early summer 2004. The surveyors used a defined protocol to record the presence or absence of bumblebee nests in prescribed areas of gardens, short grassland, long grassland and woodland, and along woodland edge, hedgerows and fence lines. The records allowed us to estimate the density of bumblebee nests in each of these habitats for the first time. 3. Nest densities were high in gardens (36 nests ha(-1)), and linear countryside habitats (fence lines, hedgerows, woodland edge: 20-37 nests ha(-1)), and lower in non-linear countryside habitats (woodland and grassland: 11-15 nests ha(-1)). 4. Findings on nest location characteristics corroborate those of an earlier survey carried out in the UK (Fussell & Corbet 1992). 5. Synthesis and applications. Gardens provide an important nesting habitat for bumblebees in the UK. In the countryside, the area occupied by linear features is small compared with that of non-linear features. However, as linear features contain high densities of nests, management options affecting such features may have a disproportionately large effect on bumblebee nesting opportunities. Current farm stewardship schemes in the UK are therefore likely to facilitate bumblebee nesting, because they provide clear guidance and support for 'sympathetic' hedgerow and field margin management.","quantifying and comparing bumblebee nest densities in gardens and countryside","1.

In this study, the use of haemocytometer (standard method) and Coulter counter is compared. All work was performed with late summer forager bees of Carniolan honey bee subspecies, prepared as isolates and homogenates of the posterior section of the worker bee's intestine. It can be concluded that the Coulter counter provides greater sample dilution flexibility at sufficient repeatability (RSD 0.01-0.1) in the cases of: (i) low concentrations of spores, as well as (ii) samples that required high dilutions (c ≥ 107 spores ml-1). However, Coulter counter use required additional data processing for obtaining precise concentration estimates at ~ 3 μm mean spore size. Nevertheless, the uncorrected, as-measured values provided concentration ranges which were found to be suitable for general diagnostic purposes.","microsporidian nosema spp. as a model gastrointestinal microorganism of carniolan","At high invasion levels, nosemosis can act as an underlying"

Studies of its biological and ecological properties in the context of the breeding system of various populations may help to understand the evolutionary mechanism of this process. We investigated some aspects of the breeding system, diversity and foraging behavior of the visitors, and relationship between population properties and fruit set in three populations from NE Poland. We found distinct compatibility systems in two studied populations and showed that if a population is self-compatible (SC), selfing is mediated by insects via geitonogamous pollen transfer. Despite the population properties (compatibility, visitor diversity and activity, population size, density, or floral display), P. caeruleum is not pollen limited and pollinators are highly important as a key factor determining the high reproductive success. Visitor assemblages (including key pollinators, bumblebees, and honey bees) and their foraging behavior on inflorescences vary between the populations, which may influence differences in the breeding system. The selfincompatible population was visited by a more diverse group of insects from Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Heteroptera, and Coeloptera, which may favor effective cross-pollen transfer, whereas the SC population was pollinated mainly by Apis mellifera, which may promote mixed-mating.

We observed multiple instances of E. tuberculatum ambushing and successfully capturing the hovering and standing guards of T. angustula near nest entrances. The unique hovering behavior of the guard caste of this bee species, an adaptation to frequent cleptoparasitism by other stingless bees, may make these guards particularly vulnerable to ground-based, ambush attacks by E. tuberculatum. Likewise, the behavior of the foraging ants appears to adaptively exploit the defensive formations and activity patterns of these bees.

Thus, understanding the reproductive dynamics of scattered tree populations will be critical in determining how they can contribute to population restoration. The distance between conspecifics should be a key predictor of reproductive success, as more isolated trees are expected to receive fewer pollinator visits and experience increased transfer of self-pollen during longer pollinator foraging bouts. Further, isolation effects should be greater in species with less mobile pollinators. Here we contrast the effects of plant isolation on reproductive success of two species of eucalypt ""paddock trees"", Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus leucoxylon, with insect- and bird-pollination, respectively. Seed production was not affected by tree isolation in either the insect- or bird-pollinated species and once outliers were removed, neither was there an effect on germination rate. As somatic mutations may bias outcrossing rate estimates, we initially screened our microsatellite markers for mutations but found no variation in microsatellite profiles throughout the canopy of trees. Individual outcrossing rates did not decline with increasing tree isolation in either the insect- or bird-pollinated species, though there was considerable variation in these rates at large distances, suggesting that pollination becomes unreliable with increasing tree isolation. We found that pollination distances have likely increased in tree species in agricultural landscapes, and that this may be facilitated by introduced honeybees in the case of E. camaldulensis. We therefore suggest that even isolated trees of these species produce seed of sufficient quantity and quality to contribute to population restoration. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Among such insect-pollinated crops, oilseed rape (Brassica napes) is increasingly cultivated worldwide. However, the degree to which seed set in B. napus depends on insect pollination is still under debate. To compare research approaches for estimating pollinator dependency, we reviewed the relevant literature published between 1956 and 2018. The majority of the studies were conducted in Europe (75%) on winter cultivars (77%) and monitored honeybees (52%). Our main findings are: (1) Dependency on insect pollination differs among cultivars and regions. (2) Field observations provide more realistic and comparable results than observations on caged plants. (3) Field conditions, soil nutrient availability, and pest management practices all influence insect dependency and subsequent yield. (4) Plot size conditions pollinator behaviour, as pollination success can be related to insect density or diversity depending on the size of the plot. (5) Insect numbers vary according to the observation distances within a field. (6) Comparison between studies is complicated by the use of different proxies to assess final yield, which may not be equivalent. We provide several recommendations to improve the reliability of future studies of oilseed rape pollination and of insect pollination dependency such as choosing open field observations compared to bag, cage or greenhouse studies, registering field conditions (pests, pesticides, fertilisation level) and defining yield as total seeds per plant to take into consideration compensation mechanisms.","review of methods to investigate pollinator dependency in oilseed rape","Insects contribute to the pollination of about 75% of crop"

This species migrates seasonally between summer and winter nesting sites, and queens appear to return to their previously occupied site. Furthermore, there is a strong tendency for colonies of this species to aggregate at perennially utilized nesting sites that may be shared by more than 150 colonies. These behavioral features suggest that colonies within aggregations should be more related than random colonies, but that the long-distance migration could act to minimize genetic differentiation both between geographical areas and within aggregations. Our genetic study supports these conjectures arising from natural history. A. dorsata aggregations are comprised of colonies that share more alleles than expected by chance. Although queens heading neighboring colonies are not close relatives, fixation indices show significant genetic differentiation among aggregation sites. However, there appears to be sufficient gene flow among aggregations to prevent high degrees of relatedness developing between colonies within aggregations. The results also suggest that there is significant population structuring between geographical regions, although the level of structuring caused by aggregation exceeds the differentiation attributable to geographic region.","genetic structure of an apis dorsata population: the significance of","Eight microsatellite loci were used to investigate the genetic structure"

An individual's decision about which task to pursue depends both on environmental stimuli and on interactions among individuals. We examine how group size affects the allocation of individuals among the various tasks. Analysis of the models shows the following. (1) Simple interactions among individuals with limited ability to process information can lead to group behaviour that closely approximates the predictions of evolutionary optimality models, (2) Because per capita rates of social interaction may increase with group size, larger groups may be more efficient than smaller ones at tracking a changing environment, (3) Group behaviour is determined both by each individual's interaction with environmental stimuli and by social exchange of information.

Our samples encompass a large proportion of the species' range; three samples are from Arizona, one from Utah, two from northern Canada, one from Mount Washington (the highest point in the eastern United States), and one from Sweden. Most samples had high levels of genetic variation compared with other bees, but the one from Sweden had low heterozygosity, suggesting that this location may have been comparatively recently colonized.

In contrast, the southern United States samples were (with the exception of one pairwise estimate) genetically divergent despite the small geographic distances separating them (average <500 km).

The basis of such approach depends on a set of features extracted from all the classes and using them to train a classifier and then use it to determine the class to which the unseen data belongs to, with a reasonable accuracy. Hence the performance of the classifier depends on the features' ability to discriminate between the good or normal and the defects. Therefore, one way of improving the classifier is to select the most appropriate features from a given feature set for the purpose of training and testing so that, at the end, better results can be achieved overall. In this paper, a novel wrapper-based feature selection approach using Bees Algorithm for the application of wood defect classification is presented. Bees Algorithm is a swarm-based optimisation technique mimicking the foraging behaviour of honey bees found in nature. In order to demonstrate the wrapper-based feature selection procedure a Minimum Distance Classifier (MDC) is used in this study. However, the method can be applied to any application using some other classifier. The study shows that, on average, a 10% improvement is achieved when a reduced sub-set of 12 features selected using the proposed wrapper-based method with Bees Algorithm is used in training and testing the MDC when compared to using the original full set of 17 features.

In plants with multiovulate ovaries, the number of conspecific pollen grains per stigma often predicts seed set and is used to quantify pollinator effectiveness. In the Asteraceae, however, florets are uniovulate, which suggests that the total amount of pollen deposited per floret may not measure pollinator effectiveness. We examined two aspects of pollinator effectiveness-effective pollen deposition and effective pollen movement-for insects visiting Echinacea angustifolia, a composite that is pollen limited in small, isolated populations. Methods We filmed insect visits to Echinacea in two prairie restorations and used these videos to quantify behavior that might predict effectiveness. To quantify effective pollen deposition, we used the number of styles shriveled per visit. To quantify effective pollen movement, we conducted paternity analysis on a subset of offspring and measured the pollen movement distance between mates. Results Effective pollen deposition varied among taxa. Andrena helianthiformis, a Heliantheae oligolege, was the most effective taxon, shriveling more than twice the proportion of styles as all other visitors. Differences in visitor behavior on a flowering head did not explain variation in effective pollen deposition, nor did flowering phenology. On average, visitors moved pollen 16 m between plants, and this distance did not vary among taxa. Conclusions Andrena helianthiformis is an important pollinator of Echinacea. Variation in reproductive fitness of Echinacea in fragmented habitat may result, in part, from the abundance of this species.","pollinator effectiveness in a composite: a specialist bee pollinates more","Premise Variation in pollinator effectiveness may contribute to pollen limitation"

A further challenge is to use them to predict changes in the assemblages of other groups. Using data from a study of the impact of land use on biodiversity, the linkages between management drivers, a range of plant functional traits and the overall foraging numbers and assemblage of bees was assessed. Bee foraging numbers were only weakly predicted by plant traits, though bee foraging assemblage was closely related to a number of different groups of plant traits (flower colour and Forage Index, as well as taxonomic group). In turn, the selected traits were significantly correlated to some of the response traits that linked the plant assemblage to management, indicating that there was a predictive pathway from management to bee abundance and assemblage structure. However, models developed with just the environmental drivers proved superior at predicting both bee numbers and assemblage. Plant traits proved to be a moderately effective predictor of bee assemblage structure. However, the use of plant traits as a link between the bees and management did not offer any improvement on models directly developed from management variables. This suggests that the bee assemblage is responding to traits that have not been quantified and that developing these trophic linkage models may have to take a different approach. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.","using plant functional traits as a link between land use","Many recent studies have shown that plant functional traits can"

Thereafter, for the peripheral exploration, the forward flying bee circles the return-goal area with expanding and alternating clockwise and counterclockwise arcs. After this two- part proximal exploration follows distal exploration, the bee flies straight towards her potential distal goal.

Mechanical vibration (MV) was included as a test treatment. The foraging activity was measured as the number of flowers visited within 5 min, the time spent on a flower collecting pollen, the number of visits that a flower received and the duration of a foraging trip. BI collected pollen more rapidly, visited more flowers within 5 min and did more visits per flower when compared with NP that also lasted longer in their trips. Significant correlations were found between environmental variables and the number of bees entering the hive and the number of bees on the flowers. For NP, the highest correlation was found for light intensity whilst in BI a negative effect of environmental temperature was detected. Regarding the quantity of fruit, BI resulted in higher fruit set when compared with NP, but the latter performed similarly to MV. However, the weight of the fruit and seed number was significantly higher for BI when compared with NP, and this was higher than for MV. Our results demonstrate that at the densities of tomato plants tested, one colony of BI was more efficient pollinator when compared with NP. We suggest that pollination efficiency of NP could have been limited by a reduced number of foragers on the plants at a given time and their limited flight range when compared with BI.

This information was also compared with evidence from aerial photographs of the area surrounding the cave taken in 1956 and 2009. Although taphonomic distortion of the dung shape precluded its assignment to its producers based on morphology, information from the organic remains reflects the agro-pastoral activities in the mountainous area of the Catalan coast. A lack of calcium phosphate and abundant phytolith and epidermal remains from wild species indicates that the dung was excreted by ovicaprines, who sheltered in the cave during spells of adverse weather. These indicators also signify that the animals fed only on natural vegetation. Insect remains in the dung include fragments of chafers, dung and ground beetles, bees and ants, and whilst the latter may have foraged in the cave, the others may have been accidentally ingested by herbivores. The nannofossils and diatoms found in the dung derive from tertiary crops 4 km away from the cave but within the range of the ovicaprine herd.

Flower colour is responsible for attraction from a distance, whereas contrasting colour patterns within flowers aid orientation of flower visitors after approaching the flowers. Due to the striking differences in colour vision systems and neural processing across animal taxa, flower colours evoke specific behavioural responses by different flower visitors. We tested whether and how yellow flowers differ in their spectral reflectance depending on the main pollinator. We focused on bees and birds and examined whether the presence or absence of the widespread UV reflectance pattern of yellow flowers predicts the main pollinator. Most bee-pollinated flowers displayed a pattern with UV-absorbing centres and UV-reflecting peripheries, whereas the majority of bird-pollinated flowers are entirely UV- absorbing. In choice experiments we found that bees did not show consistent preferences for any colour or pattern types. However, all tested bee species made their first antennal contact preferably at the UV-absorbing area of the artificial flower, irrespective of its spatial position within the flower. The appearance of UV patterns within flowers is the main difference in spectral reflectance between yellow bee- and bird-pollinated flowers, and affects the foraging behaviour of flower visitors. The results support the hypothesis that flower colours and the visual capabilities of their efficient pollinators are adapted to each other. © 2016 German Botanical Society and Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","bees, birds and yellow flowers: pollinator-dependent convergent evolution of uv","Colour is one of the most obvious advertisements of flowers,"

In this study, we decoded the waggle dances of Apis mellifera pollen foragers and used DNA barcoding of bee-collected pollen over 17 months to characterize spatio-temporal patterns in recruitment behavior and dietary breadth in a diverse yet fragmented Mediterranean scrub environment. Foragers danced for small, nearby patches of pollen resources during the cool dormant season but danced for 1.6-2.7-fold more distant and more widely dispersed resources during the hot dry season, a time of seasonal drought and floral dearth. Individual foragers collected pollen from a wide variety of species, but colonies focused recruitment on a small subset of common species in flower during each season: 2.7, 6.3, and 10% of all species in bloom during the dormant, growth, and dry seasons, respectively. Pollen foragers danced almost exclusively for cold-adapted native species during the dormant season, equally for native and non-native plants during the short growth season, and primarily for non-native ornamental species during the dry season. Our results suggest that honey bee recruitment behavior and dietary breadth may be influenced by seasonal changes in pollen resources. Furthermore, they indicate that honey bees may be useful in pollinating common native plants, and that non-native ornamental species can provide a major source of colony protein during a seasonal dearth of flowering native species.","seasonal trends in honey bee pollen foraging revealed through dna","Recent declines in the abundance and diversity of wild bee"

Plant-insect interactions in particular might become disrupted due to species-specific responses of plants and insects towards these changes. We investigated how environmental change affects flower visitation and pollination with a field study simulating pollinator habitat loss (distance to semi-natural habitat), phenological shift (anticipated flowering) and environmentally induced growth (enhanced flower height). We established 16 habitat islands of potted plants of Sinapis arvensis L., recorded all flower visitors (mainly bees, flies and pollen beetles) and quantified the seed set. Experimentally elevated flowers were less often visited by flies, while visitation by bees was not affected. Further, plants distant from calcareous grassland were less often visited by bees but visitation by flies did not decrease. Anticipated flowering reduced the number of both pollinators and herbivorous pollen beetles and increased the reproductive success (seeds per plant) of S. arvensis, showing that the loss of mutualists was compensated by an escape from antagonists. During the natural flowering period more seeds were produced close to grasslands, especially by plants of natural height, presumably due to the higher bee visitation rate. However, seed production appeared to be relatively tolerant to multiple environmental changes due to complementary patterns among the different flower visitor guilds. Our results suggest complex interactions of environmental change with responses of mutualists and antagonists, making general predictions difficult. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Male and female blueberry bees were recorded foraging on a wide range of plants in urban, suburban, and rural areas for both pollen and nectar. Female bees collected pollen from five genera in four families. Pollen on male and female bees collected on either Vaccinium or Gelsemium was predominantly from the species from which it was collected, but many specimens had both pollen types present. There were significant differences in foraging preferences among the three plant species and between gender. Overall, females preferred Gelsemium to Vaccinium, but males showed the opposite pattern. For both females and males, Azalea was the least preferred. Variation in the local abundance of flowers among the sites was not related to foraging preference. The foraging patterns of H. laboriosa in the landscape of human modified ecosystems suggests that H. laboriosa may be a mesolectic bee, using pollen from a few unrelated species, as opposed to a narrow oligolege (using pollen from only a few related species of Vaccinium).

However, long-distance pollen flow is difficult to assess, especially when the plant also relies on self-pollination. Pollen movement can be estimated indirectly through population genetic data, but complementary data on pollinator flight distances is necessary to validate such estimates. By using radio-tracking of cowpea pollinator return flights, we found that carpenter bees visiting cowpea flowers can forage up to 6 km from their nest. Foraging distances were found to be shorter than the maximum flight range, especially under adverse weather conditions or poor reward levels. From complete flight records in which bees visited wild and domesticated populations, we conclude that bees can mediate gene flow and, in some instances, allow transgene (genetically engineered material) escape over several kilometers.

One solution is habitat restoration in marginal areas, but colonization may be constrained if resident pollinator richness is low or if restored areas fail to provide sufficient floral or nesting resources. We quantified restoration outcomes for native bees, and associated resources, on three conventional farms with forb-grass prairie plantings on marginal areas of varying sizes, in a heavily farmed region of central North America. We tested bee abundance and richness in restored prairie versus the dominant habitats of the region—crops, forest remnants, and edges of fields and roads. Restored prairie supported 2× more species (95 of 119 total species) and 3× more bees (72% of captured individuals) compared to the other cover types. All richness and abundance differences among habitat types were associated with higher floral resources in restored prairie. Thirty percent of the bee species were unique to prairie, consistent with long-distance dispersal but begging the question of origin given the absence of prairie regionally. Our results suggest that road and field edges may be the source, as these areas had more floral and nesting resources than forest or crop fields combined and supported 55% of all species despite covering only approximately 5% of the sampled farms.

Ants were observed to employ two different techniques for liquid food intake, in which the glossa works either as a passive duct-like structure (sucking), or as an up- and downwards moving shovel (licking). The technique employed for collecting fluids at ad libitum food sources was observed to be species-specific and to correlate with the presence or absence of a well-developed crop in the species under scrutiny. Workers of ponerine ants licked fluid food during foraging and transported it as a droplet between their mandibles, whereas workers of species belonging to phylogenetically more advanced subfamilies, with a crop capable of storing liquids, sucked the fluid food, such as formicine ants of the genus Camponotus. In order to evaluate the performance of fluid collection during foraging, intake rates for sucrose solutions of different concentrations were measured in four ant species that differ in their foraging ecology. Scaling functions between fluid intake rates and ant size were first established for the polymorphic species, so as to compare ants of different size across species. Results showed that fluid intake rate depended, as expected and previously reported in the literature, on sugar concentration and the associated fluid viscosity. It also depended on both the species-specific feeding technique and the extent of specialization on foraging on liquid food. For similarly-sized ants, workers of two nectar-feeding ant species, Camponotus rufipes (Formicinae) and Pachycondyla villosa (Ponerinae), collected fluids with the highest intake rates, while workers of the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens (Myrmicinae) and a predatory ant from the Rhytidoponera impressa-complex (Ponerinae) did so with the lowest rate. Calculating the energy intake rates in mg sucrose per unit time, licking was shown to be a more advantageous technique at higher sugar concentrations than sucking, whereas sucking provided a higher energy intake rate at lower sugar concentrations.

In this study we examined this hypothesis, focusing on one of Israel's rarest butterflies, Tomares nesimachus (Rhopalocera; Lycaen-idae). The butterfly is affiliated with open grasslands in the north of Israel, where its sole host plant, Astragalus macrocarpus, occurs. In a two-year field study, we mapped the distribution of the butterfly in Israel and tried to evaluate the causes of its rarity and decline. We found that its abundance in habitat patches was correlated with several factors, including (a) fruit production of the host plants in each patch, (b) the number of other patches in the vicinity, (c) the characteristics of the ""matrix"" outside the patches within a distance of up to 2 km, (d) the richness of large bee species (the plant pollinators), and (e) the grazing management of the butterfly's habitat. The characteristics of the matrix further affected the richness of bees in the butterfly's habitat. Since butterfly abundance is correlated with species richness of pollinators, it can serve as an indicator of diverse, species-rich butterfly habitats (grasslands). We deduce that spccies that depend on fruit production and by themselves do not contribute to their host-plant pollination, may almost necessarily be affected by multiple ecological factors and therefore can indeed serve as good indicators. Our results further indicate that the butterfly's population dynamics are affected by large-scale processes, and hence its conservation requires the preservation of large open landscapes. Consequently, T nesimachus may also serve as an umbrella species.","the rare butterfly tomares nesimachus (lycaenidae) as a bioindicator for","Evidence suggests that insects whose existence depends on fruit production"

Our study site was located in northern Switzerland where a large population of the bees was nesting. Within two plots, (10x40 m), we marked bees with different colors and numbered tags. Seventeen percent of the 577 marked bees were recaptured over a period of 1 to a maximum of 11 days.

We show that nectar foraging rate (mass gathered per unit time) is positively correlated with worker size, in accordance with previous studies. It has been suggested that the greater foraging rate of large bees is due to their higher thermoregulatory capacity in cool conditions, but our data suggest that this is not so. Workers differing in size were not differentially affected by the weather. Regardless of size, naïve bees were poor foragers, often using more resources than they gathered. Foraging rate was not maximised until at least 30 trips had been made from the nest. Foraging rates were positively correlated with humidity, perhaps because nectar secretion rates were higher or evaporation of nectar lower at high humidity. Temperature, wind speed and cloud cover did not significantly influence foraging rate, within the summertime range that occurred during the study. Weather greatly influenced whether bees collected pollen or nectar. Pollen was preferably collected when it was warm, windy, and particularly when humidity was low; and preferably during the middle of the day. We suggest that bees collect pollen in dry conditions, and avoid collecting pollen when there is dew or rain-water droplets on the vegetation, which would make grooming pollen into the corbiculae difficult.

We suggest that although a lower limit to size may be imposed by inhabiting cold climates, overheating does not constrain large size in bumble-bees from hot climates, perhaps because they have efficient mechanisms for heat loss through shunting heat to their extremities. 3. Tropical bees had shorter thoracic setae than species from cooler climates, while B. terrestris from Greece had shorter setae than those from southern UK. Presumably shorter setae enhance heat loss in warm climates. 4. Larger workers of B. terrestris were found to have smaller extremities, in proportion to their size, than small workers. We suggest that heat retention is more important in large bees that spend more of their time foraging, than in small bees which spend much of their time in the nest where incubation of the brood requires them to lose heat. 5. In the temperate climate of southern UK, we found no evidence for ambient temperature having a differential effect on activity of workers of B. terrestris according to their size. We suggest that, at least in temperate climates, size variation in bumble-bee foragers is probably not an adaptation to temperature variation. Instead it may improve colony foraging efficiency since foragers of different sizes are suited to, and tend to visit, different flower species.","effects of climate on intra- and interspecific size variation in","1.

Its flowers were visited by a wide range of insects, most of which served as pollinators. The most frequent pollen bearers were (in decreasing order): the cricket Homoeoxipha lycoides, stingless bees of the Tetragonula testaceitarsis/hirashimai complex, hoverflies of subfam.

Whereas most pollinators visited the flowers to feed on nectar, females of Episyrphus alternans (Syrphidae: Syrphinae) were observed to oviposit despite the absence of prey for their young. Hence, we suggest that dual pollination systems contribute to the opportunist strategy of E. flava, and we discuss, in a phylogenetic framework, how the strategy fits in with those previously reported for Epipactis sect. Arthrochilium. The elastic attachment of the epichile (a universal trait in sect.

A reproductive female can raise the first generation of brood alone (independent foundation), or a colony can divide into autonomous parts in which the reproductive female is helped by sterile relatives (fission, budding, swarming). In independent-founding ants, queens can histolize their flight muscles after dispersal; in many species, large flight muscles and metabolic reserves reduce or eliminate the need for risky foraging trips during the vulnerable solitary stage. Colony division is a derived strategy, and we review the selective pressures leading to its occurrence in the different social taxa. In various ants, fission coexists with independent foundation, and alate queens are retained. However, in ants exhibiting obligate fission (e.g. all army ants and many Ponerinae), queens are permanently wingless (ergatoid), or the queen caste is missing altogether. When reproductive females are flightless, dispersal distances and colonization ability are reduced, and there are extensive modifications in mating behavior and resource allocation. We focus on the characteristics of fission in the phylogenetically primitive ants Ponerinae in which both ergatoid queens and gamergates occur. The ground-living habits of ants have permitted extensive changes in the phenotypes of their reproductive females, unlike in wasps and bees.","colony dispersal and the evolution of queen morphology in social","Social Hymenoptera show two contrasting strategies of colony reproduction.

Among them, much attention has been given to airborne particulate matter (PM) whose exposure is ubiquitous and linked with several adverse health effects mainly due to its size and chemical composition. Therefore, there is a strong need to exploit monitoring systems for airborne PM able to provide accurate information on the potential health hazards and the specific emission sources for the implementation of adequate control strategies. The honey bee (Apis mellifera, L.) is widely used as an indicator of environmental pollution: this social hymenopteran strongly interacts with vegetables, air, soil, and water surrounding the hive and, as a consequence, pollutants from these sources are translated to the insect and to the hive products. During the wide-ranging foraging activity, the forager bee is known to collect samples of the main airborne PM pollutants emitted from different sources and therefore it can be used as an efficient PM sampler. In the present research, PM contaminating forager bees living nearby a cement factory and several kilometers away from it has been analysed and characterised morphologically, dimensionally and chemically through SEM/EDX. This provided detailed information on the role of both the cement manufacturing activities and the vehicular traffic as sources of airborne PM. This may indeed help the implementation of appropriate preventive and corrective actions that would effectively minimize the environmental spread of pollutant PM not only in areas close to the plant, but also in more distant areas.","particulate matter collection by honey bees (apis mellifera, l.) near","Industrial activities play a key role in the economic well-being"

Here we evaluate how pollinator movement among plants, apparent pollen carryover, ovule number, resource limitation of seed set, and pollen output affect variation in contribution of individual pollinator species to seed set in Lithophragma parviflorum (Saxifragaceae), a species visited by a broad spectrum of visitors, including beeflies, bees, and a moth species. A previous study demonstrated differences among visitor species in their single-visit pollination efficacy but did not evaluate how differences in visitation patterns and pollen carryover affect pollinator efficacy. Incorporation of differential visitation patterns and pollen carryover effects - commonly cited as potentially important in evaluating pollinator guilds - had minor effects (0-0.6% change) on the estimates of relative contribution based on visit frequency and single-visit efficacy alone. Beeflies visited significantly more flowers per inflorescence than the bees and the moth. Seed set remained virtually constant during the first three visited flowers for beeflies and larger bees, indicating that apparent pollen carryover did not reduce per-visit efficacy of these taxa. In contrast, Greya moth visits showed a decrease in seed set by 55.4% and the smaller bees by 45.4% from first to second flower. The larger carryover effects in smaller bees and Greya were diminished in importance by their small overall contribution to seed set. Three variable plant traits may affect seed set: ovule number, resource limitation on seed maturation, and pollen output. Ovule number per flower declined strongly with later position within inflorescences. Numbers were much higher in first-year greenhouse-grown plants than in field populations, and differences increased during 3 years of study. Mean pollen count by position varied 7-fold among flowers; it paralleled ovule number variation, resulting in a relatively stable pollen:ovule ratio. Resource limitation of seed set increased strongly with later flowering, with seed set in hand-pollinated flowers ranging from 66% in early flowers to 0% in the last two flowers of all plants. Variation in ovule number and resource limitation of seed maturation jointly had a strong effect on the number of seeds per flower. Visitation to early flowers had the potential to cause more seed set than visitation to later flowers. Overall, the most important sources of variation to seed production contribution were differences among pollinators in abundance and absolute efficacy (ovules fertilized on a single visit) and potentially differential phenology among visitor species. These effects are likely to vary among populations and years.","sources of variation in pollinator contribution within a build: the","Among plants visited by many pollinator species, the relative contribution"

RESULTS: Mesonotum dipping with a 108 conidia ml−1 suspension and body contact with conidial suspension in sucrose solution caused high mortalities of adult forager bees at 25 °C optimal for conidial germination and hyphal invasion. Intriguingly, colony sizes in the hives contaminated by the forager bees contacting viable and inactivated conidia at two sites (1.2 km in distance), respectively, showed similar increase percentages (31.7% versus 29.2%) during a 4-week summer period of exposure to environment. No sign of fungal infection was found within each of the monitored colonies. Neither was fungal outgrowth observed on surfaces of bee cadavers cleaned from each hive at either site. Hourly counts of cleaned cadavers from videotapes presented no significant difference in colony-cleaning behavior between the two sites. During the period, in-hive temperatures at both sites were persistently stabilized at approximately 35 °C, which abolished conidial germination and were far above the out-hive temperature range.

To halt bee declines, it is essential that conservation actions are based on a mechanistic understanding of how bee species utilize landscapes. We aimed at teasing apart how foraging resources in the landscape through the nesting season affected nesting and reproduction of a solitary bee in a farmland region. We investigated how availability of floral resources and potentially resource-rich habitats surrounding nests affected nest provisioning and reproduction in the solitary polylectic bee Osmia bicornis. The study was performed in 18 landscape sectors dominated by agriculture, but varying in agricultural intensity in terms of proportion of organic crop fields and seminatural permanent pastures. Pasture-rich sectors contained more oak (Quercus robur), which pollen analysis showed to be favored forage in early season. More oaks 100m from nests led to higher proportions of oak pollen in nest provisions and increased speed of nest construction in early season, but this effect tapered off as flowering decreased. Late-season pollen foraging was dominated by buttercup (Ranunculus spp.), common in various noncrop habitats. Foraging trips were longer with more oaks and increased further through the season. The opposite was found for buttercup. Oak and buttercup interacted to explain the number of offspring; buttercup had a positive effect only when the number of oaks was above the mean for the studied sectors. The results show that quality of complex and pasture-rich landscapes for O.bicornis depends on preserving existing and generating new oak trees. Lignose plants are key early-season forage resources in agricultural landscapes. Increasing habitat heterogeneity with trees and shrubs and promoting suitable late-flowering forbs can benefit O.bicornis and other wild bees active in spring and early summer, something which existing agri-environment schemes seldom target.","when beggars are choosershow nesting of a solitary bee is","Wild bees are declining in intensively farmed regions worldwide, threatening"

We find that Thai N. ceranae populations share many SNPs with other global populations and appear to be clonal. However, in stark contrast with previous studies, we found that these populations also carry many SNPs not found elsewhere, indicating that these populations have evolved in their current geographic location for some time.

The results suggest that changes in flight distance to resources during the year’s flight season altered subsequent allocation decisions: mothers experiencing long flight distance to resources early in the season and short flight distance later in the season generated a greater proportion of female offspring than mothers experiencing the opposite. During the second half of the season, however, it was current experimental conditions significantly impacting decisions with those mothers residing near the resources producing a greater portion of female offspring than those far from resources, regardless of flight distances experienced earlier in the year. These results show that sex allocation decisions may change dynamically during a female’s lifetime in response to ecological changes.

Loops that take bees away from and bring them back towards the nest are common during learning flights and less so in return flights. Zigzags are more prominent on return flights.

This raises the question of the risk of dissemination of genetically modified (GM) pollen to non-GM crops by visiting insects. We inventoried the flower-visiting insects in Bt and non-Bt cotton fields of the South African Highveld region and investigated their role in pollen dispersal. Their diversity and abundance varied slightly among sites, with Astylus atromaculatus as the predominant insect on both Bt and non-Bt cotton flowers. The other major flower-visiting species were Apis mellifera and solitary Apidae. No differences were found in the abundance of each taxum between Bt and non-Bt cotton except for Scoliidae and Nitidulidae, which were scarce overall (<0.5%) but more abundant on the non-Bt flowers in the central area of the field at one site. The pollen load on A. atromaculatus was as high as on Apis mellifera. Cage tests showed that A. atromaculatus can pollinate female cotton plants by transferring pollen from male donor plants. In the field, the flight range of this insect was generally short (25 m), but it can occasionally reach up to 200 m or even more. This study therefore highlights that A. atromaculatus, commonly regarded as a pest, could be an unexpected but efficient pollinator. Because its population density can be high, this species could mediate unwanted cotton pollen flow when distances between coexiting fields are not sufficient. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","astylus atromaculatus (coleoptera: melyridae): abundance and role in pollen dispersal","In South Africa, modified Bt (Cryl Ac) cotton cultivars and"

Male-sterile lines (Ogura CMS) secreted one-half to one-third the amount of their isogenic male-fertile counterparts. Restored lines behaved as conventional rape varieties. On average, amounts of nectar were 2 mu l/flower and ranged from 0.7 to 6 mu l/flower. Among the genotypes under test, the male-sterile lines were not the least productive. The analysis of 'Samourai' winter oilseed rape showed that total sugar concentrations in nectar were highest at the beginning of the flowering period (30 g/100 ml) and lowest towards the end (10 g/100 ml). At a given date, total sugar contents in nectar of [0 +] varieties were significantly higher than those of[+ +] varieties and were due to higher fructose contents. Differences between genotypes within the same type also occurred, depending on the day of sampling. Oilseed rape nectar was confirmed to be predominantly composed of hexose (glucose and fructose). From the results of these investigations, it is concluded that the opportunity exists to select oilseed rape genotypes, including male-sterile lines, that secrete sufficient amounts of nectar to attract honeybees to ensure pollination of male-sterile lines for hybrid seed production.","nectar secretion in winter oilseed rape, brassica napus - quantitative","The genotypic variability in nectar secretion among 71 genotypes of"

First, a method for the specification of design patterns for robot swarms is proposed that builds on previous work in this field and emphasises modular behaviour design, as well as information-centric micro-macro link analysis. Next, design pattern application rules that can facilitate the pattern usage in robot control algorithms are given. A catalogue of six design patterns is then presented. The patterns are derived from an extensive list of experiments reported in the swarm robotics literature, demonstrating the capability of the proposed method to identify distinguishing features of robot behaviour and their impact on swarm performance in a wide range of swarm implementations and experimental scenarios. Each pattern features a detailed description of robot behaviour and its associated parameters, facilitated by the usage of a multi-agent modeling language, BDRML, and an account of feedback loops and forces that affect the pattern's applicability. Scenarios in which the pattern has been used are described. The consequences of each design pattern on overall swarm performance are characterised within the Information-Cost-Reward framework, that makes it possible to formally relate the way in which robots acquire, share and utilise information. Finally, the patterns are validated by demonstrating how they improved the performance of foraging e-puck swarms and how they could guide algorithm design in other scenarios. © 2018 Pitonakova, Crowder and Bullock.","information exchange design patterns for robot swarm foraging and their","In swarm robotics, a design pattern provides high-level guidelines for"

Despite the fact that Ipomopsis lacks floral features associated with bee visitation, bumblebees foraged on Ipomopsis at a rate only somewhat slower than that for a typical bee flower. Because of the deep corolla, bumblebees are able to probe only a limited distance but in 1981 nectar was more accessible due to a higher standing crop than in other years. While foraging on Ipomopsis, bees were able to obtain a net energetic profit similar to that obtained from their primary forage species. Floral choice is thus governed primarily by profitability (which can overcome innate preferences for bee flowers). The features of hummingbird flowers pose no absolute barrier to bee visitation.

Primary visitors were introduced species, honeybees and carpenter bees, both of which were pollinating the flowers. No native bee species were seen visiting flowers. In examining floral biology we found that in some cases 10% of flowers had styles that were as short as the anthers or were recurved toward the anthers. In the greenhouse, in the absence of pollinators, these flowers were the only ones that set fruit. Flowering of G. tomentosum commences in January and February, following the rainy season, peaks in May, and may continue into August and September. In one year, after higher than average precipitation during the rainy season, there was a greater abundance of flowering, and flowering persisted later into the year. Transgenic varieties of commercial cotton, G. hirsutum, are grown in Hawai'i and are interfertile with G. tomentosum. Honeybees and carpenter bees are also known pollinators of commercial cotton.

The distance between rows was manipulated to be smaller than, equal to, or greater than the distance between flowers in the same row. When the distances between adjacent flowers within a row and between rows were equal, a significant tendency to travel straight ahead was observed. This tendency was sensitive to changes in distance between rows, even when the distances between rows far exceeded the distance between flowers within a row. The tendency was abolished when the distance between rows was smaller than the distance between flowers within a row. A significant alternation of the bumble bee between rows (zigzag path) was observed in only one condition: when not only the distance between rows was much smaller than the distance between flowers in the same row, but also when the rows were staggered such that the bee could alternate between rows while still travelling in an almost straight line.

Few studies, however, have so far examined their joint effects in natural populations. In this paper we evaluate the influence of flower damage and pollination by the hummingbird Oreotrochilus leucopleurus on the fecundity of the Andean monkey flower Mimulus luteus. We performed a 2x2 factorial experiment, with artificial clipping of lower petals and selective exclusion of the hummingbird as main factors. In spite of the relatively low proportion (27.5%) of the variance in seed production accounted for by the full factorial model, artificial damage and hummingbird exclusion, as well as their interaction, were highly significant, indicating nonadditive effects of factors on plant fecundity. In the presence of hummingbirds, undamaged flowers had a seed production that was 1.7-fold higher than for damaged flowers, suggesting that the effect of flower damage on female reproductive success occurs probably as a consequence of hummingbird discrimination against damaged corollas. This result indicates that the impact of flower herbivory on plant fecundity was contingent on the presence or absence of hummingbirds, suggesting that pollinators may indirectly select for undamaged and probably resistant flower phenotypes. A second interaction effect revealed that undamaged flowers produced 78.5% more seeds in the absence of rather than in the presence of O. leucopleurus, raising the question of the ecological mechanism involved. We suggest that the strong territorial behavior exhibited by the bee Centris nigerrima may confine the foraging activities of the remaining bee species to safe sites within exclosures.

The antennal reaction of individuals was monitored at two different phases in the experiment: (1) During the first 90 approaches, and (2) after 300 approaches to artificial flowers. Unexpectedly it was found that experienced bumblebees showed the antennal reaction significantly more often at the small central colour mark than less experienced ones. During flight, bumblebees retained the antennae in a position characterised by a distance between the antennal tips of more than 5 mm and by an angle between the antennal flagella of more than 90 degrees. Prior to antennal contact with the artificial flower experienced bumblebees reduced the distance between the antenna] tips to about 5 rum, which corresponds to the diameter of the central colour mark. This adjustment was not dependent on the presence of scent-marks.

Honey bee colonies were placed in three differently protected maize fields throughout the blooming period, and thereafter they were transferred to a stationary apiary. Samples of pollen loads, bee bread, and adult bees were collected and analyzed for neonicotinoid residues. To ensure high specificity and sensitivity of detection of the analyzed pesticides, a modified QuEChERS extraction method and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry were used.

Therefore, the definition of its activity rhythm and spatial range of predation is of primary importance. Using radio frequency identification tags (RFID), two experiments were carried out to (a) determine their return ability (called homing) in releasing 318 individuals at different distance from their colony and (b) monitor their foraging activity rhythm and the duration of their flights based on 71 individuals followed 24 hr/24 during 2 months.

Until now, very long-range flight distances (up to 45 km) of male orchid bees have only been indirectly inferred from habitat requirements of orchids whose pollinaria were carried by captured males, whereas the distances established by direct measures (mark and recapture, radio telemetry) only span distances of up to around 6 km.

Here, we evaluate how fluctuations in grass seed abundance during three consecutive growing seasons influenced the foraging behaviour and diet of the harvester ants Pogonomyrmex rastratus, P. mendozanus and P. inermis in the central Monte desert, Argentina. Seed abundance of the most consumed grasses varied greatly through ant activity season, and ants altered their foraging behaviour in response to those changes. Foragers spent more time travelling and searching for food, and their foraging trips took longer during the low seed availability season. Foraging distance was very similar among species and, contrary to our expectations, did not vary between seasons. Foraging success of P. rastratus and P. inermis increased during the high availability season. This matched the seasonal pattern of foraging activity, suggesting that colonies may detect seed abundance and regulate their foraging effort with the rate of forager success. Although grass seeds were the main item in the diet of the three species, P. mendozanus, and to a lesser extent P. rastratus, turned more generalist when grass seeds were scarce. In contrast, P. inermis showed a very narrow diet breadth, only harvesting grass seeds in both seasons. Our results indicate the relevance of seed availability on foraging behaviour of harvester ants, which should be taken into account when predicting and evaluating the effect of ants on seed resources as well as numerical responses of harvester ant populations to the temporal and spatial variations in grass seed abundance.","influence of temporal fluctuations in seed abundance on the foraging","The simultaneous study of the temporal dynamics of foraging behaviour,"

The inter-plant distance was relatively shorter than the maximum distance traveled by the carpenter bees, while the trees produced few flowers per inflorescence and in moderate intensity, helping the pollination process by crossbreeding accomplished by the carpenter bees.

Additionally, males would maximize their mating opportunity by mainly perching on male plants, the only source of the most limited resource for females (pollen). © 2019 Museu de Ciències Naturals de Barcelona.","differential distribution of resources for females on a dioecious plant","Females of the solitary digger bee Andrena florea Fabricius, 1793"

We undertook a study over several years of a univoltine and communal bee, Andrena agilissima, and its main dipteran parasites, in particular the satellite fly Leucophora personata (Diptera: Anthomyiidae). Behavioural and ecological data were collected from one nesting aggregation of the host bee on the island of Elba, Italy, from 1993 to 2003, and from a foraging site of the bee, ca 5 km from the nesting aggregation. Other Diptera associated with A. agilissima at the field site were the bee fly Bombylius fimbriatus (Bombyliidae), the conopid fly Zodion cinereum (Conopidae), and the scuttle fly Megaselia andrenae (Phoridae). The phenology of the Diptera broadly overlapped with that of their host across the season of activity (end of April and all of May). Diurnal activity patterns differed slightly; L. personata in particular was active at the host's nesting site before A. agilissima. Female satellite flies also showed a range of behaviours in gaining entry to a host nest. We summarize published data on this and other Leucophora species that parasitize Andrena host bees. Host bees returning to their nests occasionally undertook zig-zag flight manoeuvres if followed by a satellite fly that were generally successful in evading the fly. Satellite flies that entered a nest, presumably to oviposit, were less likely to remain therein if another host bee entered the same nest, suggesting that one advantage to communal nesting for this host is a reduction in brood cell parasitism by L. personata. We provide the first clear evidence for parasitism by a Zodion of any Andrena host. Both L. personata and M. andrenae concentrated their parasitic activities in the zone of the host nesting aggregation with highest nest densities. Three of the Diptera, L. personata, B. fimbriatus, and Z. cinereum, seemed to have extremely low rates of parasitism whilst that of M. andrenae appeared low. Though they have refined parasitic behaviour that allows them to gain entry into host nests (L. personata, B. fimbriatus, and M. andrenae) or to parasitize adults (Z. cinereum), these parasites seem not to impact upon the dynamics of the host A. agilissima at the nesting aggregation, and the host possesses traits to reduce parasitism. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.","satellite flies (leucophora personata, diptera: anthomyiidae) and other dipteran parasites","Solitary and presocial aculueate Hymenoptera are parasitized by a range"

Using a common bumblebee species from the western United States (Bombus vosnesenskii), we ask whether seasonal decreases in food resources prompt changes in foraging behavior and space use. We employ a unique integration of population genetic tools and spatially explicit foraging models to estimate foraging distances and rates of patch visitation for wild bumblebee colonies across three study regions and two seasons. By mapping the locations of 669 wild-caught individual foragers, we find substantial variation in colony-level foraging distances, often exhibiting a 60-fold difference within a study region. Our analysis of visitation rates indicates that foragers display a preference for destination patches with high floral cover and forage significantly farther for these patches, but only in the summer, when landscape-level resources are low. Overall, these results indicate that an increasing proportion of long-distance foraging bouts take place in the summer. Because wild bees are pollinators, their foraging dynamics are of urgent concern, given the potential impacts of global change on their movement and services. The behavioral shift toward long-distance foraging with seasonal declines in food resources suggests a novel, phenologically directed approach to landscape-level pollinator conservation and greater consideration of late-season floral resources in pollinator habitat management. © 2017 by The University of Chicago.","seasonal food scarcity prompts long-distance foraging by a wild social","Foraging is an essential process for mobile animals, and its"

Unfortunately, the movements of bees are difficult to measure directly at ecologically relevant scales. A common strategy for quantifying the foraging ranges of social bees is to sample the genotypes of foragers across a landscape. Individual foragers can be assigned to colonies with polymorphic genetic markers, and the dispersion of siblings in space can be used to make inference about colony locations and foraging movements. Several previous studies have sampled sibling genotypes at discrete locations (for example, at regular points along a transect), rather than in continuous space. Restricting the collection of bees to discrete locations presents a number of considerations for sampling design and data analysis. In this paper, we develop a spatially-explicit, model-based framework for the simulation and estimation of foraging ranges. Using these tools, we simulated experiments to characterise the efficacy of different sampling strategies, and provide an example with actual data that demonstrates the advantages of our method over an approach based on regression. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","inferring the foraging ranges of social bees from sibling genotypes","A knowledge of the distances regularly travelled by foraging bees"

Physical communication in ants has been demonstrated to play a role as a modulator of behaviours such as alarm and recruitment. Honeybees can communicate the location of a resource using an advanced motor display—the waggle dance. However, no equivalent of the waggle dance has been described for any ant species, and it is widely believed that ants cannot communicate the location of resources using motor displays. One group of researchers report several demonstrations of such communication in Formica ants; however, these results have been largely ignored. More recently some evidence arose that Lasius niger foragers returning from a food source can communicate to outgoing foragers the direction that should be taken at the next bifurcation by means of physical contact on the trail. Here, we make a concerted effort to replicate these results. Although initial results seemed to indicate physical communication, once stringent controls to eliminate pheromone cues were put in place, no evidence for physical communication of food location could be found. This null result was replicated independently by a different research group on a closely related species, L. neglectus. We conclude that neither L. niger nor L. neglectus foragers communicate resource location using physical contact.

It has not yet been established, however, which specific parts of the optical flow field insects use to control their speed. With a view to answering this question, freely flying honeybees were trained to fly along a specially designed tunnel including two successive tapering parts: the first part was tapered in the vertical plane and the second one, in the horizontal plane. The honeybees were found to adjust their speed on the basis of the optic flow they perceived not only in the lateral and ventral parts of their visual field, but also in the dorsal part. More specifically, the honeybees' speed varied monotonically, depending on the minimum cross-section of the tunnel, regardless of whether the narrowing occurred in the horizontal or vertical plane. The honeybees' speed decreased or increased whenever the minimum cross-section decreased or increased. In other words, the larger sum of the two opposite optic flows in the horizontal and vertical planes was kept practically constant thanks to the speed control performed by the honeybees upon encountering a narrowing of the tunnel. The previously described ALIS (""AutopiLot using an Insect-based vision System"") model nicely matches the present behavioral findings. The ALIS model is based on a feedback control scheme that explains how honeybees may keep their speed proportional to the minimum local cross-section of a tunnel, based solely on optic flow processing, without any need for speedometers or rangefinders. The present behavioral findings suggest how flying insects may succeed in adjusting their speed in their complex foraging environments, while at the same time adjusting their distance not only from lateral and ventral objects but also from those located in their dorsal visual field. © 2011 Portelli et al.","honeybees' speed depends on dorsal as well as lateral, ventral","Flying insects use the optic flow to navigate safely in"

The model uses a submodel of resource renewal and depletion, and the principle that individuals attempt to maximize individual fitness, to construct habitat isolines. The habitat isoline for a population of nectarivores is a line in an abundance phase-plane along which all individuals of the population, regardless of the habitat they are currently exploiting, have equal expected fitness. At equilibrium the habitat isoline determines the distribution of a population between two habitats given a fixed abundance of competitors. The habitat isolines for populations of two species exploiting two habitats can be used to predict the equilibrium distribution of both species. I illustrate the model using data about bumble bees foraging for nectar in flowers (Inouye 1978). An asset of the model is its ability to make a priori predictions about flower exploitation patterns using information about resource dynamics and the foraging abilities of the nectarivores. Two warnings regarding the empirical detection of exploitation competition between species emerge from the model analysis. Depending on the range over which density manipulations are carried out in exploitation competition systems, competition may or may not be detected, while interspecific competition may or may not appear to be more intense than intraspecific competition. Although the model is directed at nectarivores competing for nectar in flowers, the results have wider implications for all systems where species compete exploitatively for resources.","habitat selection by 2 species of nectarivore - habitat quality","I present a model predicting the distribution and abundance of"

Three bumble bee species inhabit the Yuzhny (Southern) Island and the southern edge of Severny (Northern) Island of this archipelago: Bombus glacialis Friese, 1902, B. hyperboreus Schönherr, 1809, and B. pyrrhopygus Friese, 1902. Bombus glacialis shares three unique COI haplotypes that may indicate its long-term (pre-glacial) persistence on Novaya Zemlya. In contrast, Bombus hyperboreus and B. pyrrhopygus share a rather low molecular divergence from mainland populations, with the same or closely related haplotypes as those from Arctic Siberia and Norway. A brief re-description of Bombus pyrrhopygus based on the newly collected topotypes is presented. Habitats, foraging plants and life cycles of bumble bees on Novaya Zemlya are characterized, and possible causes of extremely low bumble bee abundance on the archipelago are discussed. The species-poor bumble bee fauna of Novaya Zemlya is compared with those in other areas throughout the Arctic. The mean bumble bee species richness on the Arctic Ocean islands is three times lower than that in the mainland Arctic areas (3.1 vs. 8.6 species per local fauna, respectively). General linear models (GLMs) indicate that this difference can be explained by specific environmental conditions of insular areas.

However, analyses of the combined dataset suggests the Ancylaini to be monophyletic. We address possible bias within the molecular data and show that the base composition of two markers (EF-1a and NAK) is significantly heterogeneous among taxa and that this heterogeneity is strong enough to overcome the phylogenetic signal from the other markers. Analyses of a molecular matrix where the heterogeneous partitions have been RY-recoded yield trees that are better resolved and have higher nodal support values than those recovered in analyses of the non-recoded matrix, and strongly suggest the Ancylaini to be a monophyletic sister group to the Eucerini. A dated phylogeny and ancestral range reconstructions suggest that the common ancestor of the Ancylaini reached the Old World from the New World most probably via the Thulean Land Bridge in a time window between 69 and 47 mya, a period that includes the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum.

The 'waggle' component of the dance (indicating directional information) contains an inherent error and this error becomes smaller the further the site danced for. The imprecision in the dance effectively spreads dance followers over a patch that remains relatively constant with increasing distance to a resource. This error has been proposed to be a colony-level adaptation and to confer an advantage in the context of foraging. An alternative explanation for the error in the bees' dance is that the bees simply cannot be more precise due to constraints inherent to the dance.

Strong pollen trimorphism in Pontederia cordata enables an evaluation of this hypothesis. In an investigation of pollen flow patterns in different parts of the North American range of the species, legitimate pollination of some morphs was observed in all but one population investigated. However at only one site (Ft. McCoy, Florida) was Darwin's hypothesis confirmed for the three floral morphs. The long‐styled morph most frequently exhibited legitimate pollination, the mid‐styled morph was intermediate, and the short‐styled morph rarely experienced legitimate pollination. Temporal variation in pollen flow was observed during the flowering season of P. cordata. Total stigmatic pollen loads decreased as the density of inflorescences and activity of pollinators declined. In spite of variable total loads the legitimate component was relatively constant in the long‐ and mid‐styled forms, while in the short‐styled form this measure increased as the season progressed. Little variation was detected between stigmatic samples collected at different times during a single day. Legitimate pollination may be inhibited by local foraging of pollinators and the spatial segregation of floral morphs. At Paugh Lake (Ontario) over 75% of all bumble bee flights are among the five nearest neighbours of a particular inflorescence. In the same population, there is a probability of over 70% that the nearest three neighbours of an inflorescence are of the same floral morph.

In these landscapes, wild pollinators depend on fragments of semi-natural habitat for foraging or reproduction. Small forest patches are often the most abundant type of semi-natural habitat in these agricultural landscapes. We investigated the role these patches play in conserving the pollinator community in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. Our survey of the pollinator community in 16 forest fragments showed that the pollinator community in the edges of small forest fragments is strongly influenced by forest and forest edge characteristics. Old forest fragments with a well-developed herb layer had more diverse bee communities than recent forests or old forests without a herb layer, but overall lower activity-abundances, while sun exposure of the forest edges had a strong positive effect on pollinator activity-abundance in general. The hoverfly community had higher activity-abundances in forest edges with a higher flower-index, while saproxylic hoverflies were caught in higher numbers in sites with a higher forest cover in the surrounding landscape. We also detected a strong seasonal effect. The effects of herb layer cover on bee species richness and activity-abundance were much stronger in spring than in summer, while bee species richness was also strongly positively correlated with forest age in spring. A strong positive correlation between pollinator species richness and sun exposure was found in summer, after canopy closure. While the sampled forest edges harbour a rich and diverse pollinator community, cavity-nesting bees were very scarce. This is probably caused by the low amount of dead wood in the studied forest fragments. We conclude that small forest fragments can play an important role in conserving the pollinator community, especially bees and saproxylic hoverflies. The importance of these forest fragments is strongest in spring, when the herb layer provides foraging resources. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Little is known about the impact of pollen transport by insects. We characterized the insects visiting rice plants during anthesis and considered the effects of insect pollination on gene flow. We conducted a 2-year nationwide survey in China and identified more than 510 insect species that visited rice flowers. Honeybees, hoverflies and several other species carried large amounts of pollen. The European honeybee Apis mellifera visited rice flowers regularly with daily foraging activity peaking between 12.00 and 13.00 h. We monitored 20 European honeybee colonies located 100-1000 metres away from rice fields in mixed agricultural landscapes and found the honeybees carried viable pollen at least 500 m away from the rice pollen source. We used four GM rice lines as pollen donors, their non-GM parental varieties as pollen recipients and the European honeybee as the pollinator in field-cage experiments to assess whether honeybees increase the frequency of gene flow in rice. Results from screening over 1·5 million germinated offspring seeds over a 3-year study period showed that honeybees significantly increase transgene flow in rice. Synthesis and applications.

Floral visitation is commonly observed, and in many groups specialized mouthpart morphology is associated with deep nectar extraction. In parasitic wasps, there are few data examining the relationship between host plant use and the length of the mouthparts. In an effort to associate mouthpart length to nectar source, pollen was identified from museum specimens of selected species of Agathirsia (Hymenoptera Braconidae). Despite drastic differences in glossa length, the pollen of several species of Asteraceae were commonly found on specimens of various species. We infer that increased feeding efficiency, as opposed to nectar access, is the adaptive value of elongate glossae in Agathirsia. Species with short mouthparts, however, exhibited a difference from both the medium and long mouthpart categories in pollen similarity. This suggests that members of Agathirsia with elongated mouthparts are more apt to visit certain flowers compared with short-tongued species. Males and females exhibited considerable overlap of their common nectar sources and displayed similar pollen richness. Pollen richness was higher in species in the medium length category compared with the short category, but these results are confounded by the fact that the medium-length specimens were on average larger bodied.","interspecific mouthpart length variation and floral visitation in the parasitic","Carbohydrate energy sources are known to be important for many"

To this end, we transplanted small groups of a subsocial species, which contain the offspring of a single female, from cloud forest habitat in the centre of its natural range to lower montane rainforest on the range margin and to lowland rainforest outside of the species range. Groups transplanted at the range margin and below their range limit were less likely to disperse and experienced increased mortality.

Tests were performed under two sets of conditions, those that allowed for the dispersal of bacteria via honeybee activity and those that minimized it through the use of translucent polyethylene enclosures around single trees. The enclosures also raised daytime temperatures and allowed for controlled wetting, two factors important to the development of blossom blight. Single-antagonist treatments with strain E325, Pseudomonas fluorescens strain A506, and P. agglomerans strain C9-1 were applied to open blossoms on each of 10 enclosed trees and 10 nonenclosed trees. During bloom, suspensions of antagonists (108 CFU/ml) were applied twice with a brush, and a suspension of Erwinia amylovora (107 CFU/ml) was subsequently applied once using the same method. Two days after inoculation with the pathogen, trees were misted to simulate precipitation. Flower-to-flower spread of antagonistic bacteria was less frequent on trees surrounded by plastic enclosures than on nonenclosed trees. The range and statistical separation of means for population size of E. amylovora and disease incidence among treatments were greater for enclosed trees than for nonenclosed trees. Based on these results, the natural spread of antagonists being compared may mask differences in their efficacy as biocontrol agents. Such distortions and resulting misinterpretations could be lessened by separating treatments widely in large orchard blocks and by monitoring microbial populations. Strain E325 from fresh or lyophilized cultures was consistently more effective than standard antagonists in suppressing E. amylovora and reducing disease incidence.

Mostly unanticipated, however, has been the application of the approach to areas outside of biology. OFT has inspired developments in a wide range of fields. Investigators have applied OFT to an amazing range of human endeavors both within biology and farther afield; including resource conservation and management, archaeology, criminology, gambling, searching the internet, development of computer software, and a wide variety of other human activities. The literature in relation to these areas is substantial and growing, with general agreement that OFT helps significantly. Inspiration by OFT has emerged from a combination of the following three ideas: foraging organisms face problems that are analogous to problems that humans commonly confront; organisms have evolved ‘solutions’, possibly optimal ones, to these pervasive problems; analogous solutions may help to solve the human situations that involve optimization. However, by necessity and without detracting from the usefulness of this approach, these models make assumptions that are not based on known biology and in the end do not really include much biology. None-the-less, a wide array of organisms has provided inspiration for solving many different human technology problems that involve optimization. Any human problem that involves climbing gradients towards maxima would seem well suited to OFT-inspired models or algorithms. The array of organisms that have been used as inspiration for solving such human problems is truly amazing, and has included bacteria, ants, cuckoos, honeybees, spiders, hummingbirds, bats, frogs, and even plant roots. OFT has also inspired research in other areas that do not involve optimization but include conceptual similarities between situations faced by foraging animals and certain human situations; most of these have so far been medically-related. Models or algorithms, generated in the context of human optimization, could be used to develop and test predictions in terms of animal foraging, but so far this has apparently not been attempted. Such integration between OFT and human optimization therefore awaits further research. Application and inspiration of OFT into areas outside the traditional realm of biology and into human technology have been almost completely unanticipated.

These were compared to conventionally managed cereal crops. Sampling was undertaken in 32 10 × 10 km squares throughout England, each containing a sample of the different field margin types. Bumblebee abundance in July and August was significantly higher on pollen and nectar margins (86 ± 14 bees per 100 m) compared with wildflower margins (43 ± 14), mature grass margins (6 ± 14) and recently sown grass margins (8 ± 4).

There was evidence that richness of the bumblebee assemblage at the 10 × 10 km square scale was positively correlated with land use heterogeneity, the proportion of grassland, and the abundance and richness of dicotyledon flowers. The abundance of long-tongued bees per margin was explained by the number of pollen and nectar agreements per 10 × 10 km square, together with flower abundance.

We employed high-accuracy mass-spectrometry-based proteomics to survey phosphoproteome changes in the newly emerged, nurse, and forager bees.

This illustrates that many proteins are regulated by phosphorylation independent of their expression levels. Furthermore, proteins in key biological processes and pathways were dynamically phosphorylated with age development, including the centrosome cycle, mitotic spindle elongation, macromolecular complex disassembly, and ribosome, indicating that phosphorylation tunes protein activity to optimize cellular behavior of the HG over time. Moreover, complementary protein and phosphoprotein expression is required to support the unique physiology of secretory activity in the HG.

Using spatially-explicit modelling, we examined trait combinations that lead to the survival of deceptive species under a large range of mimic strategies, from Batesian mimicry to general food deception. Unlike previous models studying such systems, we examined model-mimic interactions in the presence of a third, dissimilar species, thus generating a more realistic scenario where pollinators may avoid the model-mimic system altogether. Results showed that overall survival and abundance of species in food deceptive systems depend on the relative reward provided by the participating species and the potential alternatives available. Specifically, the success of a mimic in a Batesian mimicry system depends on high levels of reward provided by its model species relative to potential alternatives in the flower community. On the other hand, the success of a mimic in a general food deception system was higher when the reward offered was lower. Our study suggests that the ability of pollinators to utilize their experience as part of decision-making is highly relevant in promoting mimic survival, thus shedding light on the conditions under which food deception is expected.","effects of plant and pollinator traits on the maintenance of","Model-mimic plant systems are well known.

We worked in 19 gardens in the California central coast and sampled bees with aerial nets and pan traps. We measured local characteristics (i.e., vegetation and ground cover) and used the USGS National Land Cover Database to classify the landscape surrounding our garden study sites at 2 km scales. We classified bees according to nesting type (i.e., cavity, ground) and body size and determined which local and landscape characteristics correlate with bee community characteristics. We found 55 bee species. One landscape and several local factors correlated with differences in bee abundance and richness for all bees, cavity-nesting bees, ground-nesting bees, and different sized bees. Generally, bees were more abundant and species rich in bigger gardens, in gardens with higher floral abundance, less mulch cover, more bare ground, and with more grass. Medium bees were less abundant in sites surrounded by more medium intensity developed land within 2 km. The fact that local factors were generally more important drivers of bee abundance and richness indicates a potential for gardeners to promote bee conservation by altering local management practices. In particular, increasing floral abundance, decreasing use of mulch, and providing bare ground may promote bees in urban gardens.","landscape and local correlates of bee abundance and species richness","Urban gardens may preserve biodiversity as urban population densities increase,"

Five to six fold differences in nectar volume were found between the extreme genotypes. Nectar volumes were higher during noon and afternoon hours, as compared with morning hours. High correlation coefficients between nectar volume and sugar concentration were found. These were significant for the four-high nectar yielding genotypes, ranging between r = 0.65 to r = 0.94. Male-fertile flowers produced more nectar and higher sugar concentration than sterile ones. Skewed distribution was observed in nectar volume of F-2 populations, but relatively low heritability values were calculated. Pepper nectar contains fructose and glucose only. The former occupies 52-82% of the total sugar content. Pepper genotypes varied in frequency of honeybee visits and significant correlation between sugar quantity and number of honeybee visits per flower was evident.

We ask whether bee and fly pollinator taxa differ in their dispersal distances and transport of viable pollen in a human-modified system. Location Canterbury and Otago region, South Island, New Zealand. Methods We captured pollen-carrying insects travelling outside of a model mass-flowering agricultural crop, Brassica rapa, using insect flight intercept traps at five distances (0, 100, 200, 300 and 400m) from the pollen source. We examined pollen loads and pollen viability to determine whether pollen transport distance and viability differ among pollinator taxa. Results A total of 5453 insects were collected of which 717 individuals from 26 insect taxa were positively identified as dispersing pollen up to 400m from the source. These taxa consisted of four species from two bee families (Hymenoptera: Apidae and Halictidae), and eight species from four fly families (Diptera: Bibiondae, Stratiomyidae, Syrphidae and Tachinidae). Apidae generally carried higher pollen loads and more viable pollen than most fly taxa. Taxa in the fly families Stratiomyidae and Syrphidae, however, carried pollen to 400m, which is further than both bee families. Main conclusions A diverse array of wild and managed flower visitors can transport viable pollen from a pollen source to at least 400m. Knowledge of the differences in transport distances among generalist pollinators in human-modified environments is crucial to understand the potential extent to which (1) pollen transport can facilitate gene flow and (2) unwanted hybridization may occur between crops and related weeds. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","pollen transport differs among bees and flies in a human-modified","Aim Dispersal distances of insect pollinators are critical in defining"

Darwin proposed memory limitations as a potential mechanistic explanation for this flower constancy behaviour. This reanalysis of a previously published dataset, relating a real-time sequential analysis of bumblebee flower choices to the distance distribution between flowers in a natural meadow, shows that Darwin was right in an unexpected way. Bees (Bombus spp) can learn how to extract rewards from several flower species, and switching between flower species does not compromise their handling efficiency (i e flower handling times do not increase following a species switch). However, bees do lose time flying between flowers. If a flower is encountered within a short time (0-2 secs) after the last flower visit, it is likely to be visited only if it is the same species. After longer intervals (3-6 secs), bees are more likely to switch to visiting different flower species. Thus, flower constancy is in part an effect based on comparing incoming stimuli (the flowers a bee detects in flight) with a transient form of short-term (working) memory, which holds the signal of the last visited flower. The relative weighting of working and reference memory changes as time passes following a flower visit. This results in a low probability of retrieving the memory for a different flower species (from that just visited) within a short time interval after the most recent flower visit (0-2 secs). This probability rises as the signal of the last visited flower fades from working memory (>2 secs). © 2007 E.

B terrestris was always the most flower constant, followed by B lapidarius, with B pascuorum the least flower constant species. These interspecific differences in flower constancy were related to foraging performance under field conditions near Würzburg, Germany in 1999 and 2001. B terrestris was more flower constant, and predominantly outperformed B lapidarius at collecting nectar in both years. As B terrestris is also the larger of these species, these data also support the idea that larger bees are more efficient at nectar foraging, i.e. they bring home more nectar per unit time. However B pascuorum, the least flower constant of the three species tested, was the most efficient of them at collecting nectar, collecting 50% more nectar than B terrestris per hour. Therefore flower constancy appears to be a relatively poor predictor of species foraging performance, which is likely to be influenced simultaneously by many other factors including worker body size, tongue length, and foraging range. © 2005 E.

Social bees are our chosen study system because they provide a convenient and tractable biological system with which to study the potential adaptiveness of a wide range of foraging traits such as flower constancy, floral color preference, learning to associate floral color as a predictor of reward, traplining, and communication about food sources. This variety of behavioral traits allows us to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of applying five approaches (four experimental and one theoretical) to the study of foraging at the species, population, and colony level. (1) The comparative approach allows us to contrast behavioral traits of extant species with those of their common ancestor. We correlated differences in floral color preference between closely related species (and populations), with a known phylogeny, with features in each bee's respective environment. (2) Reciprocal transplant experiments allowed us to test for local adaptation. We compared the relative foraging performance of distinct bee populations in both of their respective native environments. (3) Manipulating the foraging environment to eliminate specific behavioral traits permitted a direct comparison of animals' foraging performance in their normal and experimentally manipulated environment, allowing us to quantify the effect of the trait in question (traplining) on foraging performance. (4) Manipulating the foraging phenotype to eliminate specific behavioral traits is another valuable approach. Unless suitable behavioral mutants, knockouts, or molecular techniques to selectively block gene expression are available, creating such artificial foraging phenotypes is only possible for a very small number of specific traits, for example, the honeybee dance language. (5) Integrating biologically realistic modeling with experimental studies allows us to test predictions about the adaptive significance of foraging-related traits not amenable to experimental manipulation and to identify the ranges over which these traits might affect fitness. Do these approaches provide evidence that foraging behaviors are adaptive? In some cases, we show that forager behavior has indeed been tuned to function adaptively in a given niche, although the adaptive benefits of such behavioral traits are often strongly context dependent. However, in other cases, the observed patterns of behavior were more parsimoniously explained by chance evolutionary processes, or by the historical conditions under which bees operated in their evolutionary past. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Its tiny keel flower with a very small amount of nectar hidden inside the corolla tube, a single open flower/inflorescence/day and the low floral density altogether should not be attractive to large bees. This should be true mainly upon the high-demanded energy for thermoregulation within the tropical sand dunes. Contrary to this expectation, most of the bee species sampled on S. viscosa flowers were medium to large sized bees and harvested nectar in legitimate visits by activating the keel's pollination mechanism of flowers. However, the keel was always inactivated after being visited by the enormous and frequent (78%) Xylocopa bees. All the flowers visited by these bees (including those with inactivated keels), and those experimentally protected from bee visiting produced fruits (100%). The specialized embolus mechanism of the anthers assures self-pollination. Because of this autonomous self-pollination and self-compatibility it was not possible to discriminate the relative importance of both facilitated self-pollination and cross-pollination by bees. Nevertheless, the large Xylocopa bees didn't limit self-pollination. Xylocopa cearensis was the most abundant bee (63%) and it visited several flowers (13.0 ± 4.27) in each flight route in the same clump, in spite of the low floral density therein (5 to 20 flowers.m-2). Flight distances between successive flowers varied between one and two meters (49%), and so they were higher than would be possible (15 to 70 cm) given the floral density in the clumps. The flight routes were directional, and most of shifting direction between successive flowers was below 90° with high frequency of small angles (&lt;30°). This general pattern is explained by foraging optimization with adjustments to critical resource level thresholds. Paradoxically, floral biology and flowering pattern of S. viscosa should discourage the largest dune dweller bees, but this strategy works just temporarily. In this melittophilous species, the autonomous self-pollination (assured by the embolus) can be better explained by the automatic selection hypothesis rather than by reproductive assurance hypothesis, considering the availability of large bee pollinators in the tropical dunes.","ecological interaction between the tiny keel flowers of stylosanthes viscosa","Stylosanthes viscosa is a common 'herb' in the tropical sand"

In agreement with complementary ringing recovery data and morphometric measurements, genetic results on two mitochondrial genes and 12 microsatellites showed a reasonably well-structured population partitioning along its breeding distribution. Microsatellite results indicated that not only did a few birds recently disperse long distance during their return migrations and change their natal breeding areas, but also that a group of allochthonous birds together founded a new colony.

Here, we analyze the successional changes in the bee community in a Mexican tropical dry forest, by integrating taxonomic (species, genus, and family diversity) and functional (sociability, nesting strategy, and body size) information for bees. Over one year, in a successional chronosequence (2-67 years after abandonment) we collected 469 individual bees, representing five families, 36 genera, and 69 species. Linear modeling showed decreases in taxonomic diversity with succession, more strongly so for species. Bee species turnover along succession ranged from moderate to high, decreasing slightly at intermediate stages. An RLQ analysis (ordination method that allows relating environmental variables with functional attributes) revealed clear relations between bee functional traits and the plant community. RLQ axis 1 was positively related to vegetation structural and diversity variables, and to eusociality, while solitary, parasociality, and ground nesting was negatively associated with it. Early successional fallows attract mostly solitary and parasocial bees; older fallows tend to attract eusocial bees with aerial nesting. The continuous taxonomic turnover observed by us and the functional analysis suggest that the disappearance of old fallows from agricultural landscapes would likely result in significant reductions and even local extinctions of particular bee guilds. Considering the low viability of preserving large mature tropical dry forest tracts, the conservation of older successional stands emerges as a crucial component of landscape management.","successional dynamics of the bee community in a tropical dry","Despite the recent rapid growth of tropical dry forest succession"

One method for exploring why landscape change should affect pollinator populations is to combine individual-level behavioural ecological techniques with larger-scale landscape ecology. A modelling framework is described that uses spatially-explicit individual-based models to explore the effects of individual behavioural rules within a landscape. The technique described gives a simple method for exploring the effects of the removal of wild corridors, and the creation of wild set-aside fields: interventions that are common to many national agricultural policies. The effects of these manipulations on central-place nesting pollinators are varied, and depend upon the behavioural rules that the pollinators are using to move through the environment.

These include insect pollinators, to whom field margins provide both nest sites and important resources (especially when adjacent crops are not in flower). Nesting pollinators travel relatively short distances from the nest to forage: most species of bee are known to travel less than two kilometres away. In order to ensure that these pollinators have sufficient areas of wild land within reach of their nests, agricultural landscapes need to be designed to accommodate the limited travelling distances of nesting pollinators. We used a spatially-explicit modelling approach to consider whether increasing the width of wild strips of land within the agricultural landscape will enhance the amount of wild resources available to a nesting pollinator, and if it would impact differently on pollinators with differing foraging strategies. This was done both by creating field structures with a randomised geography, and by using landscape data based upon the British agricultural landscape. These models demonstrate that enhancing field margins should lead to an increase in the availability of forage to pollinators that nest within the landscape. With the exception of species that only forage within a very short range of their nest (less than 125 m), a given amount of field margin manipulation should enhance the proportion of land available to a pollinator for foraging regardless of the distance over which it normally travels to find food. A fixed amount of field edge manipulation should therefore be equally beneficial for both longer-distance nesting foragers such as honeybees, and short-distance foragers such as solitary bees. © 2011 Rands, Whitney.","field margins, foraging distances and their impacts on nesting pollinator","The areas of wild land around the edges of agricultural"

By providing refuge for wild plants and the pollinators associated with them, field margins can also contribute to enhancing the pollination services within the monoculture. However, the effects of the monoculture on pollinator behaviour need to be carefully considered. It is known that pollinators may show density-dependent preferences such as neophobia (an avoidance of unfamiliar items) when different types of flower are available within their environment, and the dominance of monoculture crops within the environment may consequently have adverse effects upon the preferences shown by pollinators living in the field margins within them. In order to examine how pollinator preferences for wild flowers are affected by monocultures, we modelled the effects of density-dependent preferences, flower densities, and the geometry of field margins within a monoculture landscape using numerical simulations. This was done by considering how the placement of pollinator nests within a simple, spatially explicit landscape consisting of fields of monoculture crops separated by margins containing wild flowers affected the ratio of wild and monoculture crops experienced by the pollinator, given that it could only forage within a limited distance from its nest. Increasing field margin width and decreasing monoculture field width both led to an increase in pollinators visiting wild flowers (which levelled off as width increased). The size of the monoculture fields had little additional effect once they had passed an intermediate width. Increasing wild flower density within the margins led to a shift away from preferring monocultures. When wild flowers were at low densities compared to the monoculture, even the addition of small amounts of extra wild flowers had a large effect in shifting foraging preferences away from the monoculture. The distance which pollinators normally forage over only has an effect upon preferences for wild flowers when the travel distance is small. This suggests that careful consideration of margin design might be extremely important for those species which do not travel far. Innate preferences for density-dependence and particular crop types may also have an effect on preference behaviour. We demonstrate that the way in which resources are presented to indigenous pollinators may be extremely important in influencing where they choose to forage within agricultural landscapes. Careful margin design, as well as increasing the density of wild flowers (such as by enhancing the wild seed bank within the margins), may lead to overall improvements in ecosystem function within intensively farmed monocultures. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

While changes in DNA methylation accompany age polyethism, other DNA modifications accompanying age polyethism are less known. Changes in endopolyploidy (DNA amplification in the absence of cell division) with increased larval age are typical in many insect cells and are essential in adults for creating larger cells, more copies of essential loci, or greater storage capacity in secretory cells. However, changes in endopolyploidy with increased adult worker age and polyethism are unstudied. In this study, we examined endopolyploidy in honey bee workers ranging in age from newly emerged up to 55 days old. We found a nonsignificant increase in ploidy levels with age (P < 0.1) in the most highly endopolyploid secretory cells, the Malpighian tubules. All other cell types decreased ploidy levels with age. Endopolyploidy decreased the least amount (nonsignificant) in neural (brain) cells and the stinger (P < 0.1). There was a significant reduction of endopolyploidy with age in leg (P < 0.05) and thoracic (P < 0.001) muscles. Ploidy in thoracic muscle dropped from an average of 0.5 rounds of replication in newly emerged workers to essentially no rounds of replication (0.125) in the oldest workers. Ploidy reduction in flight muscle cells is likely due to the production of G1 (2C) nuclei by amitotic division in the multinucleate striated flight muscles that are essential to foragers, the oldest workers. We suggest that ploidy is constrained by the shape, size and makeup of the multinucleate striated muscle cells. Furthermore, the presence of multiple 2C nuclei might be optimal for cell function, while higher ploidy levels might be a dead-end strategy of some aging adult tissues, likely used to increase cell size and storage capacity in secretory cells.","endopolyploidy changes with age-related polyethism in the honey bee, apis","Honey bees (Apis mellifera) exhibit age polyethism, whereby female workers"

For example, neonicotinoid residues in crop nectar and pollen and the availability of alternative nectar and pollen sources vary. In addition to these practical difficulties, different field experiment designs, especially different controls, address different questions. Most field studies on neonicotinoids have compared the performance of colonies adjacent to a bee-attractive crop grown from treated seeds with control colonies adjacent to the same crop grown from untreated seeds.

The recruitment of nestmates to a specific location where there is a patch of flowers should change the economics of scouting, that is, the search for new resource patches. In particular, communication is predicted to make scouting at longer distances worthwhile because a profitable resource patch, once discovered, will enhance the foraging not only of the discoverer but also of nestmates that can be directed to the patch. By virtue of having large colonies and dance communication, honey bees are predicted to be able to profitably scout, and hence forage, at greater distances from the nest than either solitary bees or social bees without communication. We test this hypothesis by first examining existing data on foraging distance to evaluate whether honey bees do indeed forage at greater distances than other bees given their body size. Second, we present a simple cost-benefit analysis of scouting which indicates that communication causes longer range scouting to be more profitable. Overall, our analyses are supportive, but not conclusive, that honey bees forage further than would be expected given their size and that the waggle dance is a cause of the honey bee's exceptional foraging range. © 2015 Ratnieks and Shackleton.","does the waggle dance help honey bees to forage at","A honey bee colony has been likened to an oil"

Flight is necessary for dispersal in many insects, and differences in dispersal capacity may reflect dissimilarities in flight muscle aerobic capacity. In a large metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary butterfly in the A land Islands in Finland, adults disperse frequently between small local populations. Individuals found in newly established populations have higher flight metabolic rates and field-measured dispersal distances than butterflies in old populations. To assess possible differences in flight muscle aerobic capacity among Glanville fritillary populations, enzyme activities and tissue concentrations of the mitochondrial protein Cytochrome-c Oxidase (CytOx) were measured and compared with four other species of Nymphalid butterflies. Flight muscle structure and mitochondrial density were also examined in the Glanville fritillary and a long-distance migrant, the red admiral. Glanville fritillaries from new populations had significantly higher aerobic capacities than individuals from old populations. Comparing the different species, strong-flying butterfly species had higher flight muscle CytOx content and enzymatic activity than short-distance fliers, and mitochondria were larger and more numerous in the flight muscle of the red admiral than the Glanville fritillary. These results suggest that superior dispersal capacity of butterflies in new populations of the Glanville fritillary is due in part to greater aerobic capacity, though this species has a low aerobic capacity in general when compared with known strong fliers. Low aerobic capacity may limit dispersal ability of the Glanville fritillary.","differences in the aerobic capacity of flight muscles between butterfly","Habitat loss and climate change are rapidly converting natural habitats"

Their contribution to this essential ecosystem service has been threatened over recent decades by changes in land use, which have led to declines in their populations. In order to design effective conservation measures, it is important to understand the effects of variation in landscape composition and structure on the foraging activities of worker bumble bees. This is because the viability of individual colonies is likely to be affected by the trade-off between the energetic costs of foraging over greater distances and the potential gains from access to additional resources. We used field surveys, molecular genetics, and fine resolution remote sensing to estimate the locations of wild bumble bee nests and to infer foraging distances across a 20-km2 agricultural landscape in southern England, UK. We investigated five species, including the rare B. ruderatus and ecologically similar but widespread B. hortorum. We compared worker foraging distances between species and examined how variation in landscape composition and structure affected foraging distances at the colony level. Mean worker foraging distances differed significantly between species. Bombus terrestris, B. lapidarius, and B. ruderatus exhibited significantly greater mean foraging distances (551, 536, and 501 m, respectively) than B. hortorum and B. pascuorum (336 and 272 m, respectively). There was wide variation in worker foraging distances between colonies of the same species, which was in turn strongly influenced by the amount and spatial configuration of available foraging habitats. Shorter foraging distances were found for colonies where the local landscape had high coverage and low fragmentation of seminatural vegetation, including managed agri-environmental field margins. The strength of relationships between different landscape variables and foraging distance varied between species, for example the strongest relationship for B. ruderatus being with floral cover of preferred forage plants. Our findings suggest that management of landscape composition and configuration has the potential to reduce foraging distances across a range of bumble bee species. There is thus potential for improvements in the design and implementation of landscape management options, such as agri-environment schemes, aimed at providing foraging habitat for bumble bees and enhancing crop pollination services. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","effects of habitat composition and landscape structure on worker foraging","Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are important pollinators of both crops"

The predominant form of agricultural land management in this region is crofting, a system specific to Scotland in which small agricultural units (crofts) operate rotational cropping and grazing regimes. Crofting is considered to be beneficial to a wide range of flora and fauna. However, currently there is a lack of quantitative evidence to support this view with regard to bumblebee populations. In this study we assessed the effect of land management on the abundance of foraging bumblebees and the availability of bumblebee forage plants across crofts in northwest Scotland. The results of our study show that current crofting practices do not support high densities of foraging bumblebees. Traditional crofting practice was to move livestock to uplands in the summer, but this has been largely abandoned. Summer sheep grazing of lowland pasture had a strong negative impact on bumblebee abundance and forage plant availability throughout the survey period. The use of specific 'bird and bee' conservation seed mixes appears to improve forage availability within the crofted landscape, although the number of bees observed remained low. Of the forage plants available, the three most frequently visited species were from the Fabaceae. We therefore conclude that the creation of agri-environment schemes which promote the use of Fabaceae-rich seed mixes and encourage the removal of sheep grazing on lowland areas throughout the summer are essential in order to conserve bumblebee populations within crofted areas. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Experiments conducted in lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) fields indicated that home-made wooden, Koppert, and Enviroquest dispensers had no significant effects on foraging behavior or pollen loads of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens, but the presence of a dispenser did reduce the rate of workers exiting hives. Following exit of bees from dispensers, no difference was found in the quantity of the microbial agent Clonostachys rosea applied to the bees or blossoms, and distribution of product in the field was not influenced by dispenser design or distance from hives. However, the prevalence of the pathogen Botrytis cinerea in blossoms from cages that contained hives with dispensers with C. rosea was significantly less (10-20 %) than blossom infection in control plots, despite unseasonably inclement conditions and restricted foraging. These results suggest that C. rosea can be effectively delivered by commercial bumble bees for prevention of B. cinerea infection in V. angustifolium, but the efficacy of the technique will be limited during periods of poor weather that often occur in regions where lowbush blueberries are grown.

However, due to the wide foraging range, field observations of water foraging bees are difficult to carry out. Therefore, samples of returning bees were collected in front of the entrance early in the morning as well as during the day in summer and autumn 2010. In the laboratory, honey sacs of bees without pollen or propolis were examined. Honey sac samples with a weight of ≥0. 005 g were classified as successful foragers. For the determination of water or nectar foragers, the honey sac contents of successful foragers were analyzed with a refractometer. Due to the dilution and the precision of the refractometer, an accuracy of 5 % was possible. Based on the known range of sugar concentrations in nectars, the analyzed samples were divided into nectar foragers (25-65 % sugar) and water foragers (0-15 % sugar). The study reveals that nectar and water foraging bees can be discriminated by analyzing the honey sac extracts with a refractometer. In autumn, the water demand of honey bee colonies is almost exclusively covered by water collection, whereas during summer nectar is mainly used as a substitute for water.

In autumn, insecticide residues of up to 130 mu g a.s. per liter were released in WOR guttation fluid; this concentration is noticeably lower than levels reported in guttation fluid of seed-coated maize. Until winter dormancy, the concentrations declined to <30 mu g a.s. per liter. In spring, residues were linked to prewintered plants and declined steadily until flowering. The maximum release of residues in guttation fluid of seed-coated WOR occurs on the first leaves in autumn when the colonies water demand decreases. For the first time, proof for the uptake of guttation fluid from seed-coated WOR by honey bees was provided by measuring residues in individual honey-sac contents. In total, 38 out of 204 samples (19%) showed residues of thiamethoxam at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 0.95 mu g per liter while the corresponding concentrations in guttation fluid of WOR varied between 3.6 to 12.9 mu g thiamethoxam per liter.

Any such differences will affect ecosystem assembly. Thus, it is important to understand why unequal dispersal rates might occur. Recent studies have indicated strong differences between forward and backward dispersal in two major bee groups, Hylaeinae and Allodapini. Here, we use a third bee group, tribe Ceratinini, to determine whether this might be a more general phenomenon. Location: Worldwide. Methods: Ceratinini is globally distributed (excepting Antarctica) and contains the single genus Ceratina and 21 subgenera, most of which are endemic to continents. We examined the phylogeny of Ceratinini using sequence data from three genes and 99 species, and inferred ancestral distributions using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. Results: We show that the tribe Ceratinini had an African origin in the early Eocene. This was followed by four dispersals out of Africa in the Eocene and early Oligocene and three further dispersals between the Miocene and the present. There has been no back-dispersal of Ceratinini to Africa. The lack of back-dispersal cannot be explained by species abundance in non-African regions, and physical barriers to back-dispersal seem unlikely. Main conclusions: Our results are similar to findings for two other major bee groups and indicate that back-dispersal is very rare. It is unlikely that physical barriers can explain these patterns. However, dispersal patterns might be explained by assembly rules such as niche pre-emption or by reduced opportunities for escaping into enemy-free space. At a continental level, it is likely that the composition of bee fauna is more strongly influenced by very early dispersal events rather than by later physical barriers to dispersal. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","a few steps forward and no steps back: long-distance dispersal","Aim: Inequality between rates of forward and backward dispersal is"

This is the first molecular study of ceratinine bees covering representatives from both northern and southern hemisphere Old and New World regions. We use two mitochondrial and one nuclear marker (totalling 2807 nucleotides) to examine the age, cladogenesis and historical biogeography of this tribe. Tree topology and molecular dating support an African origin at about 47 Mya with subsequent dispersal into Eurasia 44 Mya, and followed by an American invasion 32 Mya. Concentrated African and Malagasy sampling revealed there were two or three dispersals events into Madagascar ranging from 25 to 9 Mya. Lineage through time analyses suggest higher rates of cladogenesis close to the origin of the tribe, and this corresponds to both major dispersal events and divergences of lineages leading to extant subgenera.

Nearby populations without any geographic barrier between them may also suffer from ecological isolation driven by habitat heterogeneity, which may promote divergence by local adaptation and drift. Likewise, elevation gradients may influence the genetic structure and diversity of populations, particularly those marginally distributed. Bathysa australis (Rubiaceae) is a widespread tree along the elevation gradient of the Serra do Mar, SE Brazil. This self-compatible species is pollinated by bees and wasps and has autochoric seeds, suggesting restricted gene dispersal. We investigated the distribution of genetic diversity in six B. australis populations at two extreme sites along an elevation gradient: a lowland site (80-216 m) and an upland site (1010-1100 m.a.s.l.). Nine microsatellite loci were used to test for genetic structure and to verify differences in genetic diversity between sites. We found a marked genetic structure on a scale as small as 6 km (F<inf>ST</inf> = 0.21), and two distinct clusters were identified, each corresponding to a site. Although B. australis is continuously distributed along the elevation gradient, we have not observed a gene flow between the extreme populations. This might be related to B. australis biological features and creates a potential scenario for adaptation to the different conditions imposed by the elevation gradient. We failed to find an isolation-by-distance pattern; although on the fine scale, all populations showed spatial autocorrelation until ~10-20 m. Elevation difference was a relevant factor though, but we need further sampling effort to check its correlation with genetic distance. The lowland populations had a higher allelic richness and showed higher rare allele counts than the upland ones. The upland site may be more selective, eliminating rare alleles, as we did not find any evidence for bottleneck.

Furthermore, pollinator availability can be critical for the success of conservation translocations of threatened flora with such interactions. Here, we investigated the pollination biology of the endangered orchid Caladenia versicolor, with the aim of improving management of wild populations and conservation translocations (artificial translocation for conservation). Using portable groups of cultivated plants to attract pollinators, we found that at natural sites C. versicolor is predominantly pollinated by food-foraging males of one species of bee, Leioproctus platycephalus (Colletidae), with only occasional visits from females or other bee species. This apparently high degree of specialization occurred despite the presence of a co-occurring bee community of > 20 species. Although previously thought to be nectarless, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of labellum secretions revealed that C. versicolor produces meagre quantities of sucrose on the upper surface of the labellum, on which some pollinators appeared to feed. Reproductive success was high in C. versicolor at both natural and translocated sites. Although C. versicolor now has a restricted range, L. platycephalus is found across a broad area of southern Australia. Thus, pollinator availability does not appear to have contributed to the rarity of C. versicolor, but the apparent reliance on L. platycephalus means that the availability of this species needs to be taken into account for conservation management and translocations. © 2018 The Linnean Society of London.","pollination of an endangered caladenia species (orchidaceae) by nectar-foraging behaviour","The geographical range of pollinators is an important factor determining"

In the Asian endemic Hiptage benghalensis (Malpighiaceae), mirror-image flowers were found with longitudinally dehiscing anthers and such floral syndromes are firstly reported in the family. We investigated the floral biology and frequencies of left- and right-styled flowers of H.benghalensis in Hainan Island, southern China. We conducted pollination manipulations to determine breeding systems and studied the pollination mechanism. We also examined the compositions of the secretions of the calyx gland. Controlled pollinations revealed that H.benghalensis is self-compatible. Left- and right-styled flowers are produced in the same inflorescence and a 1:1 ratio is found at both plant and population levels. Flowers have extremely reflexed petals, zygomorphic corollas and a single but oversized calyx gland. This gland secretes sugars and mainly attracts ants and wasps in both blooming and fruiting periods. Heteranthery is obvious with one large stamen producing more viable pollen than the nine small stamens. All anthers dehisce longitudinally and pollen grains readily adhere to floral visitors without the need of buzz pollination. The unusual association of mirror-image flowers with longitudinal anthers probably reflects an adaptation to local pollen-collecting (but non-buzzing) honeybees such as Apis dorsata. These results indicate that floral syndromes and pollination adaptation in H.benghalensis differ completely from the New World Malpighiaceae and may help to explain evolutionary adaptations of the family during its long-distance dispersals from the New World to Asia. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.","mirror-image flowers without buzz pollination in the asian endemic hiptage","Mirror-image flowers represent a highly specialized pollination system that is"

Abundance and diversity in flower availability benefit bee populations; however, little is known about which of protein or carbohydrate resources may limit their growth and reproductive performance. Here, we test the hypothesis of complementary resource limitation using a supplemental feeding approach. We applied this assumption with bumble bees (Bombus terrestris), assuming that colony growth and reproductive performance should depend on the continuous supply of carbohydrates and proteins, through the foraging for nectar and pollen, respectively. We placed wild-caught bumble bee colonies along a landscape gradient of seminatural habitats, and monitored the colonies' weight, foraging activity, and reproductive performance during the whole colony cycle. We performed supplemental feeding as an indicator of landscape resource limitation, using a factorial design consisting of the addition of sugar water (carbohydrate, supplemented or not) crossed by pollen (protein, supplemented or not). Bumble bee colony dynamics showed a clear seasonal pattern with a period of growth followed by a period of stagnation. Higher abundance of seminatural habitats resulted in reducing the proportion of pollen foragers relative to all foragers in both periods, and in improving the reproductive performance of bumble bees. Interestingly, the supplemental feeding of sugar water positively affected the colony weight during the stagnation period, and the supplemental feeding of pollen mitigated the landscape effect on pollen collection investment. Single and combined supplementation of sugar water and pollen increased the positive effect of seminatural habitats on reproductive performance. This study reveals a potential colimitation in pollen and nectar resources affecting foraging behavior and reproductive performance in bumble bees, and indicates that even in mixed agricultural landscapes with higher proportions of seminatural habitats, bumble bee populations face resource limitations. We conclude that the seasonal management of floral resources must be considered in conservation to support bumble bee populations and pollination services in farmlands.","limitation of complementary resources affects colony growth, foraging behavior, and","Resource availability in agricultural landscapes has been disturbed for many"

The potential effectiveness of three-dimensional Lévy searches has not been examined but is central to a proper understanding of marine predators and T cells which have provided the most compelling empirical evidence for LW. Here I extend Lévy search theory from one to three dimensions. The new theory predicts that three-dimensional Lévy searching can be advantageous but only when targets are large compared with the perceptual range of the searchers, i.e. only when foragers are effectively blind and need to come into contact with a target to establish its presence.

We also reanalysed pre-existing data for Drosophila flies walking in featureless environments. Across these species, we found evidence of common scale-invariant properties in their movement patterns; pause and movement durations were typically power law distributed over a range of scales and characterized by exponents close to 3/2. Our analyses are suggestive of the presence of a pervasive scale-invariant template for locomotion which, when acted on by environmental cues, produces the movements with characteristic scales observed in nature. Our results indicate that scale-finite complexity as embodied, for instance, in correlatedrandom walk models, may be the result of environmental cues overriding innate behaviour, and that scale-free movements may be intrinsic and not limited to ‘blind’ foragers as previously thought. ©2015 The Authors.","evidence for a pervasive ‘idling-mode’ activity template in flying and","Understanding the complex movement patterns of animals in natural environments"

We report on an in-depth exploration of an iterative improvement heuristic model of bumblebee traplining previously found to accurately replicate the establishment of stable routes by bees between flowers distributed over several hectares. The critical test for a model is its predictive power for empirical data for which the model has not been specifically developed, and here the model is shown to be consistent with observations from different research groups made at several spatial scales and using multiple configurations of flowers. We refine the model to account for the spatial search strategy of bees exploring their environment, and test several previously unexplored predictions. We find that the model predicts accurately 1) the increasing propensity of bees to optimize their foraging routes with increasing spatial scale; 2) that bees cannot establish stable optimal traplines for all spatial configurations of rewarding flowers; 3) the observed trade-off between travel distance and prioritization of high-reward sites (with a slight modification of the model); 4) the temporal pattern with which bees acquire approximate solutions to travelling salesman-like problems over several dozen foraging bouts; 5) the instability of visitation schedules in some spatial configurations of flowers; 6) the observation that in some flower arrays, bees' visitation schedules are highly individually different; 7) the searching behaviour that leads to efficient location of flowers and routes between them.

We hypothesise that flying insects like bees discover new food sources using an optimal Lévy flight searching strategy and odour-mediated anemotaxis, as well as visual cues. To study these searching patterns, foraging honeybees were trained to a scented feeder which was then removed. Two new unrewarding feeders, or 'targets', were then positioned up- and downwind of the original location of the training feeder. The subsequent flight patterns of the bees were recorded over several hundred metres using harmonic radar. We show that the flight patterns constitute an optimal Lévy flight searching strategy for the location of the training feeder, a strategy that is also optimal for the location of alternative food sources when patchily distributed. Scented targets that were positioned upwind of the original training feeder were investigated most with the numbers of investigations declining with increasing distance from the original feeder. Scented targets in downwind locations were rarely investigated and unscented targets were largely ignored, despite having the same visual appearance as the rewarding training feeder. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","honeybees use a lévy flight search strategy and odour-mediated anemotaxis","The availability of food resources changes over time and space,"

In this study, we separated the influence of two functionally distinct floral visitors (hawkmoths and solitary bees) and characterized their impacts on multiple paternity in a self-incompatible, annual forb, Oenothera harringtonii (Onagraceae). We also situated pollinator-mediated effects in a spatial context by linking variation in multiple paternity to variation in plant spatial isolation. We documented pronounced differences in the number of paternal sires as function of pollinator identity: on average, the primary pollinator (hawkmoths) facilitated mating with nearly twice as many pollen donors relative to the secondary pollinator (solitary bees). This effect was consistent for both isolated and nonisolated individuals, but spatial isolation imposed pronounced reductions on multiple paternity regardless of pollinator identity. Considering that pollinator abundance and pollen dispersal distance did not vary significantly with pollinator identity, we attribute variation in realized mating dynamics primarily to differences in pollinator morphology and behaviour as opposed to pollinator abundance or mating incompatibility arising from underlying spatial genetic structure. Our findings demonstrate that functionally distinct pollinators can have strongly divergent effects on polyandry in plants and further suggest that both pollinator identity and spatial heterogeneity have important roles in plant mating dynamics. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","pollinator identity and spatial isolation influence multiple paternity in an","The occurrence and extent of multiple paternity is an important"

In western Europe, L. malachurum exhibits north-south clines of increasing colony size associated with the production of more worker broods, and worker production of males, but societies conform to the model of a classically eusocial hymenopteran insect. A population of L. malachurum studied from 1994 to 1998 at Agios Nikolaos Monemvasias in southern Greece exhibits a startlingly different type of social structure. Dissections of female bees collected while foraging on flowers or from excavations of nests showed that the majority of mid- to late-summer workers are mated and (or) have developing ovaries, indicating that some workers are highly reproductive. Nest excavations indicated that in many or most coloniess, the queen has disappeared by midsummer, before ovipositing the final, reproductive brood. In orphan nests, workers become the major reproductives, which suggests that males and gynes in the final brood are the offspring of workers. The very long breeding season in southern Greece may explain why colonies often outlive their queen.

Here, we demonstrate a new method of co-occurrence analysis that employs probability theory to estimate spatial distribution of rare species populations and areas of pesticide use to determine the likelihood of potential exposure. Specifically, we 1) describe a probabilistic method to estimate pesticide use based on crop production patterns; 2) construct species distribution models for 2 listed insect species whose ranges were previously incompletely described, the rusty-patched bumble bee (Bombus affinis) and the Poweshiek skipperling (Oarisma poweshiek); and 3) develop a probabilistic co-occurrence methodology and assessment framework. Using the principles of the Bayes' theorem, we constructed probabilistic spatial models of pesticide use areas by integrating information from land-cover spatial data, agriculture statistics, and remote-sensing data. We used maximum entropy methods to build species distribution models for 2 listed insects based on species collection and observation records and predictor variables relevant to the species' biogeography and natural history. We further developed novel methods for refinement of these models at spatial scales relevant to US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) regulatory priorities (e.g., critical habitat areas). Integrating both probabilistic assessments and focusing on USFWS priority management areas, we demonstrate that spatial overlap (i.e., potential for exposure) is not deterministic but instead a function of both species distribution and land use patterns.

The model is able to predict pollen-parent fecundity distributions based on polycross size alone. The model predicts that the effective polycross size will be approximately 9 % smaller than under random mating (i.e., N (e)/N similar to 0.91). The model is simple and can easily be incorporated into other models or simulations requiring a pollen-parent fecundity distribution.

This review details the composition of floral bouquets that elicit strong attraction in pollinators, demonstrating that for some species of plants the composition of the bouquet plays an important role in exploiting the insect's olfactory system, thereby driving innate attraction, whereas other bouquets can be learned as an associative cue for the nectar reward. By associative learning of nonattractive floral odors with a nectar reward-through octopamine-associated modulation of neurons in the antennal lobe-insects have the ability to exploit alternate floral resources when their preferred flowers are no longer present. Such neural mechanisms, present in specialist and generalist pollinators, provides the means by which pollination associations can range from specialized to generalized while permitting insects to exist within a dynamic floral environment.","the neuroecology of a pollinator's buffet: olfactory preferences and learning","Plants and their pollinators are excellent examples of mutualistic associations"

Until recently it was not possible to apply this very powerful technique to study the behaviour of insects flying close to the ground because the strong radar echoes, reflected from ground features and from vegetation ('clutter'), almost always mask the very weak signals returned from insects. This constraint has been overcome, at least for insects weighing more than ≈ 50 mg, by the development of an harmonic radar, and of transponder tags small enough to be carried by these insects without impeding their flight performance. Because the transponders have to be carried by insects in flight, extreme miniaturisation was obviously essential and it was achieved by using a passive, frequency-doubling technique, so that no on-board battery was needed. Transponders with all-up weights of between 1 and 12 mg were produced, the weights varying according to the degree of mechanical robustness required. The frequency-doubled signals from the transponder are selectively detected by the radar so that the tagged insects can be located even in the presence of very strong clutter. The system has three major advantages over conventional visual and video methods of observing low-flying insects. Firstly, and most importantly, its range of operation (up to 900 m) allows surveillance and flight tracking over hundreds of thousands of m2, i.e. four orders of magnitude greater than is possible with conventional methods. Secondly, it provides dynamic and geometrically correct records of the insects' horizontal flight paths and thirdly, it works equally well by day and night.

The age of an insect strongly influences many aspects of behavior and reproduction. The interaction of age and behavior is epitomized in the temporal polyethism of honey bees in which young adult bees perform nurse and maintenance duties within the colony, while older bees forage for nectar and pollen. Task transition is dynamic and driven by colony needs. However, an abundance of precocious foragers or overage nurses may have detrimental effects on the colony. Additionally, honey bee age affects insecticide sensitivity. Therefore, determining the age of a set of individual honey bees would be an important measurement of colony health. Pteridines are purine-based pigment molecules found in many insect body parts. Pteridine levels correlate well with age, and wild caught insects may be accurately aged by measuring pteridine levels. The relationship between pteridines and age varies with a number of internal and external factors among many species. Thus far, no studies have investigated the relationship of pteridines with age in honey bees. Methods. We established single-cohort colonies to obtain age-matched nurse and forager bees. Bees of known ages were also sampled from colonies with normal demographics. Nurses and foragers were collected every 3-5 days for up to 42 days. Heads were removed and weighed before pteridines were purified and analyzed using previously established fluorometric methods. Results. Our analysis showed that pteridine levels significantly increased with age in a linear manner in both single cohort colonies and colonies with normal demography. Pteridine levels were higher in foragers than nurses of the same age in bees from single cohort colonies. Head weight significantly increased with age until approximately 28-days of age and then declined for both nurse and forager bees in single cohort colonies. A similar pattern of head weight in bees from colonies with normal demography was observed but head weight was highest in 8-day old nurse bees and there was no relationship of head weight with age of foragers. Discussion. Although the relationship between pteridine levels and age was significant, variation in the data yielded a +4-day range in age estimation. This allows an unambiguous method to determine whether a bee may be a young nurse or old forager in colonies with altered demographics as in the case of single cohort colonies. Pteridine levels in bees do not correlate with age as well as in other insects. However, most studies used insects reared under tightly controlled laboratory conditions, while we used freeliving bees. The dynamics of head weight change with age is likely to be due to growth and atrophy of the hypopharyngeal glands. Taken together, these methods represent a useful tool for assessing the age of an insect. Future studies utilizing these methods will provide a more holistic view of colony health. © 2016 Rinkevich et al.","pteridine levels and head weights are correlated with age and","Background.

In addition to the characteristics of agricultural plots, bee assemblages in them are influenced by the adjacent habitats. Perennial, fruit-oriented nopal (Opuntia spp.) orchards cover large surfaces in Mexico, North Africa, South America and southern U.S.A. and produce tens of thousands of flowers, but their value as habitat for bees was unknown. To document bee assemblages in nopal orchards in the Llanos de Ojuelos, southern Mexican Plateau, and to assess the influence of adjacent habitats on them, we surveyed bees in nopal orchards adjacent to cropland (Cr-orchards) and adjacent to natural shrubland patches (Sh-orchards), and in remnants of natural shrubland. We used color traps and manual capture from flowers during the 2016 and 2017 peaks of Opuntia blooming periods. We hypothesized that Sh-orchards would harbor richer and larger native bee assemblages than Cr-orchards, and that assemblages´ similarity between these Sh-orchards and shrublands would be greater than between Cr-orchards and shrublands. We collected 3823 individuals of 45 different bee taxa; 90% of all taxa, in nopal orchards. Our results partially support the premise that proximity of natural habitats to agricultural plots is positive for their bee overall abundance, but distance from shrublands did not impoverish bee species richness. Mean similarity values between Cr-orchards, Sh-orchards, and shrublands were not significantly different, as result of shrubland patches being very variable. As a result of their perennial condition and limited agricultural practices, nopal orchards provide shelter, forage, and nest substrate for native bee species, albeit perhaps less in Cr-orchards than in Sh-orchards, and likely facilitate bee movement between orchards and, or shrublands through a matrix of annual croplands. In doing so, this agroecosystem enhances regional bee community resilience in the context of an anthropized landscape. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","the effect of adjacent habitat on native bee assemblages in","The decline of pollination services in some regions has stimulated"

Travel route optimization or resource acquisition constraints usually lead to repeated sequences of visits, which may have major evolutionary and ecological implications. However, the study of this behavior has been impaired by a lack of concepts and methodologies. We here formally define routine movement behavior, provide an index that quantifies the degree of repetitiveness in movement sequences in terms of minimal conditional entropy, and design a flexible procedure that detects the specific subsequences that are repeated. We demonstrate our framework using computer simulations and real-world movement data of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus) introduced into a novel environment. The simulation example showed that our methods can suitably reveal the increase in the level of routine movement behavior during home range (HR) establishment. Black-tailed deer did not show such an increase, suggesting that HR establishment occurred very fast. In both examples, our procedure determining the subsequences that are repeated provides a precise visualization of routine movements. Our approach solves limitations in the study of routine movement behavior and thus opens promising perspectives for the study of the linkages between cognition, foraging strategies, and environments. Although we developed it to study routine movement behavior, it can be applied to any type of behavioral sequence and should thus be of interest to a broad range of behavioral ecologists.","from randomness to traplining: a framework for the study of","Memory allows many animals to benefit from the spatial predictability"

We assessed whether the abundance and diversity of wild bees (Apoidea) were influenced by the removal of harvest residue and associated soil compaction within managed conifer forest in western Oregon, USA. We sampled bees over two years (2014-2015) on study plots that were subjected to five treatments representing gradients in removal of harvest residue and soil compaction. We collected >7,500 bee specimens from 92 distinct species/morphospecies that represented five of the seven bee families. We trapped 3x more individuals in the second year of the study despite identical sampling effort in both years, with most trapped bees classified as ground-nesting species. Members of the sweat bee family (Halictidae) comprised more than half of all specimens, and the most abundant genus was composed of metallic green bees (Agapostemon, 33.6%), followed by long-horned bees (Melissodes, 16.5%), sweat bees (Halictus, 15.9%), and bumble bees (Bombus, 13.6%). In both years, abundance and observed species richness were greatest in the most intensive harvest residue treatment, with other treatments having similar values for both measures. Our study indicates that early successional managed conifer forest that has experienced removal of harvest residue can harbor a surprising diversity of wild bees, which are likely to have important contributions to the broader ecological community through the pollination services they provide.","wild bee diversity is enhanced by experimental removal of timber","The use of timber harvest residue as an energy source"

But they also pose a threat through the disruption of locally adapted gene pools. At Hyams Beach, New South Wales, Australia, four bushland stands of the rare shrub, Grevillea macleayana McGillivray, surround an urban area containing remnant and cultivated specimens of this species. Numbers of inflorescences per plant, fruits per plant, and visits by pollinators were similar for plants in urban gardens and bushland. Urban plants represented a substantial but complex genetic resource, displaying more genetic diversity than bushland plants judged by He, numbers of alleles per locus, and number of private alleles. Of 27 private alleles in urban plants, 17 occurred in a set of 19 exotic plants. Excluding the exotic plants, all five stands displayed a moderate differentiation (FST = 0.14 ± 0.02), although the urban remnants clustered with two of the bushland stands. These patterns may be explained by high levels of selfing and inbreeding in this species and by long-distance dispersal (several seeds in the urban stand were fathered by plants in other stands). Genetic leakage (gene flow) from exotic plants to 321 seeds on surrounding remnant or bushland plants has not occurred. Our results demonstrate the conservation value of this group of urban plants, which are viable, productive, genetically diverse, and interconnected with bushland plants. Gene flow has apparently not yet led to genetic contamination of bushland populations, but high levels of inbreeding would make this a rare event and difficult to detect.

Thermal cameras have been considered as a potential nest searching tool because they reduce the visual complexity of the environment by displaying a homogenized thermal landscape to the searcher. In this study, we compare the use of a thermal camera to human searches using two trials: (i) using inexperienced volunteers to search along the transect for a known bumble bee nest and (ii) using an experienced individual to search across a number of novel locations. We found thermal cameras are not a better nest detection technique than human searches, having low success rates across both trials.

We sampled bees in 30 forest openings created by group selection harvest as well as 30 sites in adjacent mature forest to examine the extent to which small forest openings support bees, to identify environmental variables influencing bee abundance and diversity, and to gauge their potential to augment bee populations in adjacent unmanaged forest. Bees were significantly more abundant and diverse in forest openings than in mature forest, but species composition did not differ. There was no relationship between opening size and abundance or diversity of bees in openings or adjacent mature forest. Both abundance and diversity were generally positively related to the amount of early-successional habitat on the landscape. Within openings, overall abundance and diversity decreased with vegetation height and increased with a metric representing floral richness and abundance. Notably, social, soft-wood-nesting, and small bees exhibited the opposite pattern in adjacent forest, increasing with vegetation height in openings and decreasing with greater floral richness and abundance within openings. Our results suggest that the creation of small forest openings helps to promote bees both in openings and adjacent mature forest, but this pattern is not consistent for all guilds.

Observational studies suggest that there are a set of conditions required for the production of toxic honey, but these factors have not been well studied. This research aims to investigate the importance of altitude and weather conditions for the production of toxic honey in New Zealand and makes some recommendations for a review of the New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA) Food (tutin in honey) Standard 2008 that was introduced after a toxic honey outbreak in 2008. Transects were established in parts of the North Island during the summer of 2009 and were visited weekly for 6 consecutive weeks. Variables recorded were elevation, S. australis density, honeydew abundance, honey bee and wasp (Vespula spp.) presence and temperature and rainfall data. Weather conditions present during the 2008 outbreak were compared with those from 1999 to 2009. S. australis were not present at altitudes of 375 m and above; with more research, some higher areas of New Zealand may be able to be reclassified as 'low risk'. Honeydew was available in a wide range of temperature and rainfall conditions. Rainfall appeared to wash honeydew from tutu bushes; however, it quickly reappeared in densely populated sites. Honey bee and wasp presence was positively affected by the presence of honeydew, nevertheless 3-50% of the time they were observed foraging in the absence of honeydew, indicating they may feed on small amounts of dew. As the absence of honeydew is an option given by the NZFSA to demonstrate honey safety, this requires investigation. Weather conditions leading up to the 2008 toxic honey outbreak were warm and dry but were not significantly different from other years. Therefore, inadequate management practices, rather than more favourable environmental conditions were probably responsible for the 2008 toxic honey outbreak. Future research should focus on determining the conditions required for toxic levels of honeydew to be incorporated into hives, and regions that have not produced toxic honey historically should be closely studied to determine whether any fit the low-risk criteria. © 2010 The Royal Society of New Zealand.","investigating the importance of altitude and weather conditions for the","Toxic honey is produced in New Zealand when honey bees"

It has since spread very rapidly and has caused significant mortality among honeybees and native entomofauna. It also poses a risk to humans because its sting provokes allergic reactions. The objectives of this study were the following: (i) to disentangle the roles played by human-mediated dispersal and self-mediated dispersal in the species' rapid range expansion and (ii) to estimate the intensity of control measures in France and determine what needs to be done to slow the hornet's spread and dramatically reduce its population densities. A mathematical model was developed to describe the hornet's potential spread. This model included parameters describing the population growth rate, carrying capacity, self-mediated dispersal, human-mediated dispersal and the efficacy of control measures (i.e. the destruction of detected nests). Model parameters were estimated using 2004–2009 occurrence data for France and the model was then validated using 2013 occurrence data. Several scenarios were tested: human-mediated dispersal was present or absent and control intensity varied. Then, the species' spread in coming years was simulated (from 2013 to 2020). Despite some uncertainty on the value of the parameters, this model is relatively robust. Human-mediated dispersal may not be necessarily responsible for the hornet's rapid range expansion; the species could spread rapidly on its own. It is likely that to date, an average of 30–40% of detected nests have been destroyed each year. Increasing the percentage of destroyed nests from 30 to 60% could reduce the species' spread by 17% and its nest density by 29%. If 95% of nests are destroyed, the species' spread and nest density could decline by 43% and 53%, respectively. Synthesis and applications. The mathematical model developed in this study shows that human-mediated dispersal of the invasive yellow-legged hornet may not be the only factor explaining the hornet's rapid range expansion and that controlling this invasive pest is still possible. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reduce self-mediated dispersal and to intensify and improve control measures to diminish the species' impact and prevent its further spread. Control measures could combine the mechanical removal and destruction of individuals or infested materials with biological control techniques. © 2016 The Authors.

Experiments with artificial swarms demonstrated similar reorientation by bees and further showed that the experience of being in a swarm triggers patterns of behaviour apparently used in reorientation. In addition, bees remembered information about the natal nest even after they moved to a new nest: Reoriented bees from artificial swarms deprived of their new hive returned to their natal hive rather than to another equidistantly located hive.

Intriguingly, when walking over hills, the ants incorporate the ground distance, the paths' projection to the horizontal plane, into their path integrator. This review discusses how Cataglyphis may solve this computational feat. To infer ground distance, ants must incorporate the inclination of path segments into the assessment of distance. Hair fields between various joints have been eliminated as likely sensors for slope measurement, without affecting slope detection; nor do postural adaptations or changes in gait provide the relevant information. Changes in the sky's polarization pattern due to different head inclinations on slopes were ruled out as cues. Thus, the mechanisms by which ants may measure slopes still await clarification. Remarkably, the precision of slope measurement is roughly constant up to a 45 degrees inclination, but breaks down at 60 degrees. An encounter of sloped path segments during a foraging trip induces a general acceptance of slopes, however, slopes are not associated with specific values of the home vector. All current evidence suggests that Cataglyphis does not compute a vector in 3-D: path integration seems to operate exclusively in the horizontal plane.","path integration in a three-dimensional world: the case of desert","Desert ants use path integration to return from foraging excursions"

Any vector navigation system requires that the animal is able to evaluate the angles steered and the distances travelled. Here we investigate whether the ants acquire the latter information by monitoring self-induced optic flow. To answer this question, the animals were trained and tested within perspex channels in which patterns were presented underneath a transparent walking platform. The patterns could be moved at different velocities (up to > 0.5 the ant's walking speed) in the same or in the opposite direction relative to the direction in which the animal walked. Experimental manipulations of the optic flow influenced the ant's homing distances (Figs. 2 and 4). Distance estimation depends on the speed of self-induced image motion rather than on the contrast frequency, indicating that the motion sensitive mechanism involved is different from mechanisms mediating the optomotor response. Experiments in which the ants walked on a featureless floor, or in which they wore eye covers (Fig. 6), show that they are able also to use additional (probably kinesthetic) cues for assessing their travel distance. Hence, even though optic flow cues are not the only ones used by the ants, the experiments show that ants are obviously able to exploit such cues for estimation of travel distance.","desert ants cataglyphis-fortis use self-induced optic flow to measure distances","While foraging, desert ants of the genus Cataglyphis use a"

The assay differentiated B. napus and B. rapa pollen carried by honey bees (Apis melifera), bumblebees (Bombus spp.), mining bees (Andrena spp.) and hoverflies (Syrphidae) captured on B. napus plants 1–2 m from wild B. rapa, and on B. rapa plants at various distances from the crop.

However, Bombus and Andrena individuals captured on B. rapa occasionally carried crop pollen up to 300 m from the source field. Hoverflies carried less pollen overall but featured high proportions of B. napus pollen even at the most distant capture points.

However, their function within the motivational system remains unclear. I tested the hypothesis that displacement activities have a functional role during transitions between motivational states, using the honeybee model system. I observed a number of locomotory and grooming behaviours performed when foraging honeybees returned to the hive to dance. These focal behaviours occurred significantly more frequently during the period of transition from waggle dancing to exiting the hive to forage than during the periods before the waggle dance or during the waggle dance. By contrast, the control behaviour, trophallaxis, was distributed across time periods significantly differently, occurring with equal frequency in all periods. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that displacement activities have a functional role during motivational transitions. Evidence from other species suggests that the most likely function is facilitation, rather than inhibition, of the transition.

Because termites have unique life-history traits and significant interspecific differences exist regarding their nesting and foraging habits, comparative studies on PO activity can shed light on the general principles influencing immune investment against the backdrop of sociality, reproductive potential, and gender. We quantified PO activity across four termite species ranging from the phylogenetically basal to the most derived, each with their particular nesting/foraging strategies. Our data indicate that PO activity varies across species, with soil-dwelling termites exhibiting significantly higher PO levels than the aboveground wood nester species which in turn have higher PO levels than arboreal species. Moreover, our comparative approach suggests that pathogenic risks can override reproductive potential as a more important driver of immune investment. No gender-based differences in PO activities were recorded. Although termite PO activity levels vary in accordance with a priori predictions made from life-history theory, our data indicate that nesting and foraging strategies (and their resulting pathogenic pressures) can supersede reproductive potential and other life-history traits in influencing investment in PO. Termites, within the eusocial insects, provide a unique perspective for inferring how different ecological pressures may have influenced immune function in general and their levels of PO activity, in particular.","phenoloxidase activity in the infraorder isoptera: unraveling life-history correlates of","Within the area of ecological immunology, the quantification of phenoloxidase"

The behavior is applicable to fixed wing aircraft traversing long ranges, and reduces the online computation and sensors required compared to other visual methods. This method combines the kinematics of fixed wing aircraft flight, the direction of apparent motion of an image sequence, and a magnetic compass to create a bioinspired optomotor reflex similar to those observed in insects. This behavior accurately controls track in the inertial reference frame (path taken over the ground) with only limited dependence on altitude, speed, and wind. We show that the proposed behavior is naturally convergent and stable, and present experimental results from simulation and real-world flight demonstrating that the method performs robustly, producing improvement over both magnetic-referenced and visual odometry-based navigation within the limits of the sensor.","reducing the complexity of visual navigation: optical track controller for","Using vision for navigation of airborne systems provides an opportunity"

The efficiency of sucrose solution uptake by Melipona was compared to that of domesticated European Apis mellifera. Dynamics of nectar foraging were also recorded for 3 of the Melipona visiting the forest shrub, Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae). 1. Sugar concentration in nectar brought to nests averaged from 21 to 60% sugar for 15 colonies of M. fasciata, M. compressipes triplaridis, M. fuliginosa and M. marginata micheneri. Concentrations ranged from 19 to 72%, and all species collected nectars ranging at least between 24 and 63% sugar. However, M. compressipes and M. marginata preferred higher concentrations and foraged less on dilute nectars. Peak colony nectar harvest occured in late morning or early afternoon; peak pollen harvest was in early morning. 2. Imbibing rates of bees given 20, 30, 45, 60 or 70% sucrose solutions were highest at ≦45% sucrose, but caloric intake was most rapid at 60% sucrose for all species. All but M. marginata displayed greater net intake rates than domesticated European Apis mellifera. A foraging choice model incorporating caloric reward and imbibing rates of bees suggests M. compressipes and M. marginata should specialize on richer nectars. Rate of caloric intake per forager weight was higher for all Melipona (0.03-0.13g) than for A. mellifera (0.10 g). 3. The nectar of Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae), a shrub pollinated exclusively by Melipona, progressed from 35 to 60% sugar during the day. Bees foraged most when nectar was below 60% concentration, a pattern best explained as the result of intercolony competition and greater availability of lower quality nectar. 4. Sugar concentration in nectar harvested by colonies rose from lower to higher values through the day for Melipona. The increasing caloric reward of nectar is adaptive in exploiting foraging preferences of such bees. As standing nectar crop is depleted by competing bees, a gradual shift to more rewarding nectar should promote increased bee foraging range, more flower visits during a foraging trip, floral constancy, and genetic outcrossing. 5. The nectar load capacity of A. mellifera is greater than that of Melipona. Other factors being equal, Africanized A. mellifera, now a permanent resident of neotropical forests, should visit more flowers during a foraging trip.

Despite sharing most pollen resources and nectar of the same quality with 20 introduced colonies of the African honey bee (Apis mellifera), native stingless bees of 12 species were largely unaffected by its activity. Pollen and nectar harvested by the honey bees were 10–200 times that procured by 17 stingless bee colonies. This discrepancy in total harvest and general lack of competitive effect is explained by a honey bee foraging area over 10 times that of the native bees, and apparent foraging shifts to escape competition with honey bees, thus reduced potential overlap in foraging sites. Seven cases of direct resource competition for pollen or nectar were documented, out of 31 tests. Rare periods of intensive harvest were diminished by competing African honey bees. Such harvest peaks lasted for only a few hours in 13 days of observation. Despite average duration of 4% foraging time for each species, peaks included as much as 51% total harvest. Calculations based upon colony populations, food stores and flight range show that if African honey bees persist at a density of 1 colony per km2, colonies of some stingless bee species may disappear after 10 years.

Their numbers followed seasonal trends shown in independent studies, thus indicating bee abundance and activity in a large area. No measurable population-level impact of competition between this invading honey bee and native bees, despite many demonstrations of resource competition at flower patch and colony levels, changed annual abundances of all 15 native bee species. Native bee abundance did not decrease, nor did native bees show substantial reciprocal yearly change with honey bee abundance. One strong negative correlation of bee catches with an extremely rainy year was found. However, multiple regression using rainfall and honey bee abundance as the independent variables showed that neither was responsible for bee population change over 17 years.

The only high-canopy foragers were two nocturnal bees, all the rest flew at both heights with similar probability or consistently came to lower traps. Large euglossines showed a tendency to forage high, which was directly related to their capacity for heat loss during flight, compared to smaller euglossines. They are also more conspicuous in warning coloration, another expected correlate of foraging more often in the open.

For a given diet, offspring body size generally increases with an increase in the amount of food consumed as a larva, but the extent to which body size is influenced by the type of food consumed is poorly known. Pollen ranges from 2-60% protein among plant species, and bees are extremely efficient at assimilating nitrogen; therefore, it seems likely that either parent bees adjust the size of larval provisions to compensate for differences in pollen protein concentration or bee offspring attain different body size depending on the pollen type(s) consumed as a larva. We presented the generalist sweat bee Lasioglossum zephyrum with pollen diets that differed in protein content and monitored offspring body size during two experiments. In a protein supplementation experiment, diets ranged from 20-66% protein and consisted of Typha pollen amended with soy protein. On a pollen/soy diet, offspring body size increased 25% with a shift from 20-37% protein, but did not increase further at greater protein concentrations. In a multiple pollen experiment, pollen diets ranged from 20-39% protein and consisted of eight pollens that differed naturally in protein concentration. The largest offspring arose from the most protein-rich pollens, whereas much smaller bees developed on protein-poor pollens. Provision size only predicted offspring size when pollen type, and therefore protein quantity, was considered. Adult foragers did not adjust provision size to compensate for pollen protein. Therefore, offspring body size appears to result from a combination of controlled (provision size) and uncontrolled (pollen quality) factors that arise out of bee foraging decisions.","the effect of pollen protein concentration on body size in","Adult bees and wasps provide all the food their offspring"

(d) Are C. bombi cells present in honey-bee faeces? (e) Does C. bombi have an effect on the mortality of honey bees after ingestion? 4. While both parasites were found to be specific to their hosts at the genus level, results suggest that honey bees may play a role in the epidemiology of C. bombi transmission.","honey bee and bumblebee trypanosomatids: specificity and potential for transmission","1.

Three colonies of each species were moved into each of two sites. Three samples of pollen and three samples of honey were collected from each colony: the first collection occurred at the beginning of the study and the following ones at every six months during a year. Thus the total number of samples collected was 36 for honey (18 for A. mellifera and 18 for S. mexicana) and 36 for pollen (18 for A. mellifera and 18 for S. mexicana). We found that 88.44% and 93.33% of honey samples, and 22.22% and 100% of pollen samples of S. mexicana and A. mellifera, respectively, resulted positive to at least one organochlorine. The most abundant pesticides were Heptaclor (44% of the samples), γ-HCH (36%), DDT (19%), Endrin (18%) and DDE (11%). Despite the short foraging range of S. mexicana, the number of pesticides quantified in the honey samples was similar to that of A. mellifera. Paradoxically we found a small number of organochlorines in pollen samples of S. mexicana in comparison to A. mellifera, perhaps indicating a low abundance of pollen sources within the foraging range of this species. © 2018 by the authors.

To examine whether this is due to the landscape context farms are situated in and traits of the studied organisms, we surveyed bumble bees in cereal field borders and margins at 12 pairs of matched organic and conventional farms, with half the pairs located in heterogeneous farmland and the remaining in homogeneous plains. Species richness and abundance of bumble bees were significantly positively related to both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity. However, there was an interaction effect between farming practice and landscape context so that species richness and abundance were only significantly higher on organic farms in homogeneous landscapes. The higher abundance of bumble bees on organic farms was partly related to higher flower abundance on these sites. The effect of landscape context on bumble bee abundance was stronger for species with medium sized colonies than for those with smaller and larger colony sizes. These patterns may reflect that species with medium sized foraging ranges are most affected by fragmentation of foraging habitat, because colony size reflects the spatial scale at which bumble bees utilize resources. We conclude that both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity can be used to increase bumble bee species richness and abundance, but that organic farming has a larger effect in homogeneous landscapes and landscape heterogeneity a larger effect on conventional farms. The effects differed between species, suggesting that a single prescription to increase pollinator abundance may not be valid. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined whether addition of late-season flowering red clover affected worker, queen and male bumble bee densities. Bumble bees were surveyed in flower-rich uncultivated field borders across 24 landscapes (radius 2 km) with or without a clover field in the centre, varying in semi-natural grassland (SNG) and early MFC availability. Clover fields had over ten times higher worker densities compared to field borders, suggesting red clover as favoured forage. Five times more queens and 71% more males were found in landscapes with clover fields compared to control landscapes, despite these fields constituting less than 0.2% of the landscape area. Both MFC and SNG increased the density of males, but only in the presence of clover fields.

Although many plant species have inducible defences to save metabolic costs of defence in the absence of herbivores, plant responses induced by herbivore attack can have ecological costs. For example, herbivore-induced responses can affect flower traits and alter interactions with flower visitors. Such plant-mediated interactions between herbivores and flower visitors can affect plant reproductive output. Current knowledge on the generality and specificity of plant-mediated herbivore-flower-visitor interactions and its consequences for plant fitness is limited. In this study, we investigated whether a broad range of herbivores feeding on the annual plant Brassica nigra affect interactions with flower visitors, whether the direction of interactions is predicted by the feeding modes (chewing and sap-feeding) and sites (above- and belowground) of the herbivores, and whether it results in fitness consequences for the plant. Our results show that attack of B. nigra by a range of different herbivores influenced plant interactions with mutualist pollinators and an antagonist florivore, the pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus. Pollinator community composition was affected by herbivory, whereas overall pollinator attraction was maintained. Pollinator community composition of uninfested plants differed from that of chewing and root herbivore-infested plants. Main responders in the pollinator communities to changes induced by herbivory were syrphid flies, bumblebees, and solitary bees. Although the preference of pollen beetle adults was not affected by herbivory, beetle larvae performed best on plants infested with the nematode Heterodera schachtii. The changes in pollinator community composition and syrphid fly visitation can explain the observed increase in seed set of root herbivore-infested plants. Interactions of flowering B. nigra plants with mutualist and antagonist insects are well integrated and conflicting interactions do not reduce reproductive output. Our results suggest some degree of specificity in herbivore-flower-visitor interactions with consequences for plant fitness. Specificity of plant responses were determined at the species level as well as the herbivore functional group level, and differed depending on the flower visitor. Because plant reproduction was affected by indirect plant-mediated interactions, these can potentially result in selection on plant strategies to optimize growth, defence and reproduction.","dealing with mutualists and antagonists: specificity of plant-mediated interactions between","Plants need to deal with antagonists, such as herbivores, while"

Increasing habitat that provides forage and nesting sites could boost struggling populations, particularly in urban, suburban and agricultural landscapes. The millions of acres beneath aerial electric transmission lines, sometimes referred to as easements or rights-of-way, must be kept free of tall-growing vegetation and hence have the potential to provide suitable habitat for many native species. Prior work has demonstrated that bee communities in easements managed using alternatives to episodic mowing were more diverse than in nearby open areas, however true control sites within the easements were unavailable. In order to compare vegetation management protocols, we conducted a two-year study which enabled us to directly compare transmission line easements in three locations currently undergoing Integrated Vegetation Management-a dynamic form of management involving spot removal and herbicide treatment of unwanted species (treatment) with nearby sites undergoing standard management protocols of yearly or biyearly mowing (control). Results show that treatment sites had significantly higher abundance and species richness than controls. Seasonal differences were pronounced, with the spring fauna most affected by differences in vegetation management. In addition, the older treatment sites house more social bees, more parasitic species and a more even distribution of bees across nesting guilds. Finally, we established that treatment sites had distinct bee communities, further increasing their value as sources for native bee populations in the landscape. Overall, the data clearly show the value of implementing alternative active vegetation management in the land under powerlines to achieve an increase in the abundance and diversity of wild bees.","increasing the conservation value of powerline corridors for wild bees","Mounting evidence suggests declines in the abundance and diversity of"

However, the persistence of invaders in a wide range of ecological communities may mean that they provide resources and refuge for threatened native species, or supplement ecosystem services. Location: Agroecosystems in the USA. Methods: We use a 2-year field experiment to explore the potential positive and negative impacts of an invasive thistle (Carduus acanthoides) on the composition of the resident community of foraging insects. The presence or absence of the thistle was the only difference in experimental and control plots comprising a background community of ten flowering annual species. Results: We demonstrate that the invasive thistle is both highly visited and strongly preferred by bees relative to other flowering species. Bee abundance was 302% higher and bee species richness 35% higher in habitat patches where the thistle was present compared to where it was absent. In addition, the abundance of Bombus species, a native group recently found to be in decline, was 479% higher when the thistle was present. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that, despite causing significant problems, the invasion of this non-native species may also provide crucial benefits via floral resources for pollinators. Benefits, such as the floral resources that invaders provide to pollinators, should also be taken into account in conservation and invader management plans.

There was a yearly difference in the percentage of the dominant pollens collected. The percentage of cells with one pollen showed between year, population, and season differences. There were no differences in the populations' nesting successor offspring production.

Moreover, eye design represents a balance between often conflicting requirements for gathering different forms of visual information. The trade-off between spatial resolving power and contrast sensitivity is common to all visual systems, and European honeybees (Apis mellifera) present an important opportunity to better understand this trade-off. Vision has been studied extensively in A. mellifera as it is vital for foraging, navigation and communication. Consequently, spatial resolving power and contrast sensitivity in A. mellifera have been measured using several methodologies; however, there is considerable variation in estimates between methodologies. We assess pattern electroretinography (pERG) as a new method for assessing the trade-off between visual spatial and contrast information in A. mellifera. pERG has the benefit of measuring spatial contrast sensitivity from higher order visual processing neurons in the eye. Spatial resolving power of A. mellifera estimated from pERG was 0.54 cycles per degree (cpd), and contrast sensitivity was 16.9. pERG estimates of contrast sensitivity were comparable to previous behavioural studies. Estimates of spatial resolving power reflected anatomical estimates in the frontal region of the eye, which corresponds to the region stimulated by pERG. Apis mellifera has similar spatial contrast sensitivity to other hymenopteran insects with similar facet diameter (Myrmecia ant species).

We used a comparative approach to test whether rarity is associated with reproductive biology in two closely-related species pairs. This system has been recently altered by changes in fire regimes and the introduction of European honeybees. More than 35% of flowers matured fruits in the common species after natural-pollination compared to <20% of flowers in the rare species. All species were obligate outcrossers in each of the study populations, but only the two rare species were pollen-limited, having significantly lower fruit-set on open-pollinated flowers than those cross-pollinated by hand (mean ± SE; 0.18 ± 0.02 vs. 0.42 ± 0.05; p < 0.001). Native bees (Leioproctus species) and introduced honeybees (Apis mellifera) visited all species. The native bees visited fewer flowers within a plant and moved greater distances between plants while foraging than honeybees, so the native bees are expected to be more effective in promoting outcrossing. While honeybees were the most frequent visitors to flowers of all species, native bees made more visits to common than rare species (0.65 ± 0.20 vs. 0.20 ± 0.09). Our results suggest that the poorer reproductive success in rare Persoonia species is associated with lower pollinator effectiveness, which is exacerbated by frequent fires and introduced honeybees.

Honey bees are a classic example and maintain their thoracic muscles at temperatures (Tth) tuned to the caloric benefits of floral resources. Using infrared thermography, we tested the hypothesis that forager motivation to recruit nestmates for a food source is positively correlated with Tth. We trained bees to a sucrose feeder located 5-100?m from the nest. Recruiting foragers had a significantly higher average Tth (2.7°C higher) when returning from 2.5?mol?l-1 sucrose (65% w/w) than when returning from 1.0?mol?l-1 sucrose (31% w/w). Foragers exhibited significantly larger thermal fluctuations the longer they spent inside the nest between foraging trips. The difference between maximum and minimum temperatures during a nest visit (Trange) increased with total duration of the nest visit (0.7°C increase per additional min spent inside the nest). Bees that recruited nestmates (waggle or round danced) were significantly warmer, with a 1.4-1.5 times higher ΔTth (difference between Tth and nest ambient air temperature) than bees who tremble danced or simply walked on the nest floor without recruiting between foraging bouts. However, recruiter Tth was not correlated with finer-scale measures of motivation: the number of waggle dance circuits or waggle dance return phase duration.

One group foraged in a stable array of six flowers for 40 foraging bouts, thereby enabling it to establish a long-term memory of the array, and adjust its spatial movements accordingly. The other group was faced with an array that changed between (but not within) foraging bouts, and thus had only access to a working memory of the flowers that had been visited. Bees in the stable array started out sampling a variety of routes, but their tendency to visit flowers in a repeatable, stable order (""traplining"") increased drastically with experience. These bees used shorter routes and converged on four popular paths. However, these routes were mainly formed through linking pairs of flowers by near-neighbour movements, rather than attempting to minimize overall travel distance. Individuals had variations to a primary sequence, where some bees used a major sequence most often, followed by a minor less used route, and others used two different routes with equal frequency. Even though bees foraging in the spatially randomized array had access to both spatial working memory and scent marks, this manipulation greatly disrupted foraging efficiency, mainly via an increase in revisitation to previously emptied flowers and substantially longer search times.

During these flights, the insects turn back to face the nest entrance and subsequently back away from the nest while flying along ever increasing arcs that are centred on the nest. Flying along these arcs, the insects counter-turn in such a way that the nest entrance is always seen in the frontal visual field at slightly lateral positions. Here we asked how the insects may achieve keeping track of the nest entrance location given that it is a small, inconspicuous hole in the ground, surrounded by complex natural structures that undergo unpredictable perspective transformations as the insect pivots around the area and gains distance from it. We reconstructed the natural visual scene experienced by wasps and bees during their learning flights and applied a number of template-based tracking methods to these image sequences. We find that tracking with a fixed template fails very quickly in the course of a learning flight, but that continuously updating the template allowed us to reliably estimate nest direction in reconstructed image sequences. This is true even for later sections of learning flights when the insects are so far away from the nest that they cannot resolve the nest entrance as a visual feature. We discuss why visual goal-anchoring is likely to be important during the acquisition of visual-spatial memories and describe experiments to test whether insects indeed update nest-related templates during their learning flights. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","ground-nesting insects could use visual tracking for monitoring nest position","Ants, bees and wasps are central place foragers.

A number of stressors have been identified as potential contributing factors, including the extensive prophylactic use of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are highly toxic to bees, in agriculture. While multiple routes of exposure to these systemic insecticides have been documented for honey bees, contamination from puddle water has not been investigated. In this study, we used a multi-residue method based on LC-MS/MS to analyze samples of puddle water taken in the field during the planting of treated corn and one month later. If honey bees were to collect and drink water from these puddles, our results showed that they would be exposed to various agricultural pesticides. All water samples collected from corn fields were contaminated with at least one neonicotinoid compound, although most contained more than one systemic insecticide. Concentrations of neonicotinoids were higher in early spring, indicating that emission and drifting of contaminated dust during sowing raises contamination levels of puddles. Although the overall average acute risk of drinking water from puddles was relatively low, concentrations of neonicotinoids ranged from 0.01 to 63 mg/L and were sufficient to potentially elicit a wide array of sublethal effects in individuals and colony alike. Our results also suggest that risk assessment of honey bee water resources underestimates the foragers' exposure and consequently miscalculates the risk. In fact, our data shows that honey bees and native pollinators are facing unprecedented cumulative exposure to these insecticides from combined residues in pollen, nectar and water. These findings not only document the impact of this route of exposure for honey bees, they also have implications for the cultivation of a wide variety of crops for which the extensive use of neonicotinoids is currently promoted.","neonicotinoid-contaminated puddles of water represent a risk of intoxication for","In recent years, populations of honey bees and other pollinators"

We reared colonies from wild-caught bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) queens, placed them at sites characterized by varying degrees of urbanization from inner city to rural farmland and monitored the production of sexual offspring across the entire colony cycle. Our land-use cluster analysis identified three site categories, and this categorization was a strong predictor of colony performance. Crucially, colonies in the two clusters characterized by urban development produced more sexual offspring than those in the cluster dominated by agricultural land. These colonies also reached higher peak size, had more food stores, encountered fewer parasite invasions and survived for longer.

Here, we present a flexible GIS-based land classification protocol for pollinator research using a bottom-up approach driven by reference to pollinator ecology, with urbanization as a case study. Our multistep method involves manually generating land cover maps at multiple biologically relevant radii surrounding study sites using GIS, with a focus on identifying land cover types that have a specific relevance to pollinators. This is followed by a three-step refinement process using statistical tools: (i) definition of land-use categories, (ii) principal components analysis on the categories, and (iii) cluster analysis to generate a categorical land-use variable for use in subsequent analysis. Model selection is then used to determine the appropriate spatial scale for analysis. We demonstrate an application of our protocol using a case study of 38 sites across a gradient of urbanization in South-East England. In our case study, the land classification generated a categorical land-use variable at each of four radii based on the clustering of sites with different degrees of urbanization, open land, and flower-rich habitat. Studies of land-use effects on pollinators have historically employed a wide array of land classification techniques from descriptive and qualitative to complex and quantitative. We suggest that land-use studies in pollinator ecology should broadly adopt GIS-based multistep land classification techniques to enable robust analysis and aid comparative research. Our protocol offers a customizable approach that combines specific relevance to pollinator research with the potential for application to a wide range of ecological questions, including agroecological studies of pest control.","a land classification protocol for pollinator ecology research: an urbanization","Land-use change is one of the most important drivers of"

However, little is known regarding the recruitment precision of stingless bees. Hence, in this study, we examined the effects of experience and spatial distance on the precision of the food communication system of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona mexicana. We conducted the experiments by training bees to a three-dimensional artificial patch at several distances from the colony. We recorded the choices of individual recruited foragers, either being newcomers (foragers without experience with the advertised food source) or experienced (foragers that had previously visited the feeder). We found that the average precision of newcomers (95.6 ± 2.61%) was significantly higher than that of experienced bees (80.2 ± 1.12%). While this might seem counter-intuitive on first sight, this ""loss"" of precision can be explained by the tendency of experienced recruits to explore nearby areas to find new rewarding food sources after they had initially learned the exact location of the food source. Increasing the distance from the colony had no significant effect on the precision of the foraging bees.

Moreover, the location-specific recruitment of reactivated foragers, i.e., foragers that have previously experienced the same food source at a different location and time, has not been explicitly examined. However, such foragers may also play a significant role in colony foraging, particularly in small colonies. Here we report that reactivated Scaptotrigona mexicana foragers can recruit with high precision to a specific food location. The recruitment precision of reactivated foragers was evaluated by placing control feeders to the left and the right of the training feeder (direction-precision tests) and between the nest and the training feeder and beyond it (distance-precision tests). Reactivated foragers arrived at the correct location with high precision: 98.44% arrived at the training feeder in the direction trials (five-feeder fan-shaped array, accuracy of at least ±6° of azimuth at 50 m from the nest), and 88.62% arrived at the training feeder in the distance trials (five-feeder linear array, accuracy of at least ±5 m or ±10% at 50 m from the nest).

We tested the effect of two modalities, forager-deposited odor marks and the visual presence of foragers, on the orientation of stingless bee (Scaptotrigona mexicana) recruits. Our results show that odor marks alone were significantly more attractive than multimodal information, and that multimodal information was significantly more attractive than visual forager presence alone.

However, site switching between patches tends to occur with low frequency while a given patch is still rewarding, thus reducing pollen dispersal and gene flow between patches. In principle, forager switching and gene flow between patches could be higher when close patches offer similar rewards. We investigated site switching during food recruitment in the stingless bee Scaptotrigona mexicana. Thus, we trained three groups of foragers to three feeders in different locations, one group per location. These groups did not interact each other during the training phase. Next, interaction among trained foragers was allowed. We found that roughly half of the foragers switched sites, the other half remaining faithful to its training feeder. Switching is influenced by the presence of recruitment information. In the absence of recruitment information (bees visiting and recruiting for feeders), employed foragers were site specific. Foragers only switched among feeders that were being visited and recruited to. Switching was not caused by learned aversion to experimental handling. Switching in response to recruitment could provide a fitness benefit to the colony by facilitating rapid switching among exploited patches and provide a benefit of increasing plant gene flow between patches.","food recruitment information can spatially redirect employed stingless bee foragers","Within a rewarding floral patch, eusocial bee foragers frequently switch"

Attenuation or amplification of the vibratory signal depends on its frequency and on the type of comb. In general, framed combs, both large and small, strongly attenuate higher frequencies, whereas these are amplified in small open combs. The very poor transmission properties of the large framed combs used in commercial hives may explain the bees' habit of freeing an area of comb from the frame in those areas used for dancing. Extracellular electrical recordings from the leg of a honeybee detect large action potentials from receptors that monitor extension of the tibia on the femur. Measurements of threshold displacement amplitudes show these receptors to be sensitive to low frequencies. The amplification properties of unframed combs extend the range of these receptor systems to include frequencies that are emitted by the bee during its dance, namely the 15 Hz abdomen waggle and 250 Hz thorax vibration.","transmission of vibration across honeycombs and its detection by bee","Vibration of the rims of open cells in a honeycomb,"

However, costs associated with foraging can also influence food choice: animals faced with a poor-quality food source may either continue feeding on it (a conservative strategy), or search for a potentially more profitable one (a more risky strategy). Groups of nomadic, trail-following Malacosoma disstria caterpillars were offered a leaf of two different hosts, either side by side to determine preference, or at a distance to investigate how exploration costs affect food choice. Arenas with and without pheromone trails were used to distinguish between direct travel costs and unknown territory costs. When two leaves were side by side, groups of second-instar caterpillars showed clear preferences between host trees, whereas groups of fourth-instar larvae did not. When the two leaves were distant from each other, groups of second-instar caterpillars usually remained on the known source, irrespective of food preference or group size. These groups were more likely to relocate to a preferred food source when pheromone trails were present, suggesting that trails effectively decrease unknown territory costs. Groups of fourth-instar caterpillars were more likely to leave the known food source even when no trail was present, suggesting a developmental shift in costs associated with exploration. Our results show that collective choices reflect food preference when exploration costs are low (second-instar larvae with pheromone trails), but not when they are high (second-instar larvae without trails). Such a conservative foraging strategy can be adaptive if the exploration costs of leaving a known food source are greater than the potential benefits of discovering a better alternative, for example, in a homogenous environment like that of a tree.

However, empirical evidence for this fundamental assumption is surprisingly scarce and often contradictory. Theoretically, the evolution of alternative life history strategies is underpinned by a trade-off between activity levels and survival. We investigated the consequences of specialization in a foraging context, by comparing the performance and longevity of closely related individuals in a social insect, the common wasp (Vespula vulgaris). Using radio-frequency identification technology, we monitored the lifetime foraging activity of individual wasps from three colonies kept under natural foraging conditions. Returning foragers were video-recorded as they passed the nest entrance so that their foraging load could be assessed. There were substantial differences in foraging activity and survival within and between colonies. At the colony level, foraging specialization was weak. Yet, workers within each nest demonstrated a remarkable range of foraging specialization levels (defined as the degree of overlap between individual and colony-level task allocation) and efficiencies (defined by the number of successful trips and trip duration). We found that specialist foragers were less efficient than generalist siblings within the same colony. Behavioural specialists accomplished fewer successful trips per foraging day, and their trips were typically relatively longer. Specialized foragers also showed reduced life expectancy. The mortality risk was higher for individuals spending relatively more time in the field, yet we found no link between the level of specialization and relative field exposure. Our extensive dataset of unprecedented detail provides strong empirical evidence that behavioural specialization is not associated with a better lifetime performance, on the contrary, the opposite appears true for the common wasp. We also show that the survival of genetically similar individuals can be linked to life-long differences in behaviour according to classical life-history theory predictions.","behaviourally specialized foragers are less efficient and live shorter lives","A widely held assumption in ecology is that specialists are"

We tested whether changes in the density of neighborhood conspecific and heterospecific plants and in the availability of resources influence the frequency and composition of floral and frugivorous visitors of eleven individuals of the same population of the threatened palm Euterpe edulis in Brazil. The frequency of floral visitors was positively associated with conspecific density and availability of resources. Species composition was affected by the availability of resources since some bee species were associated with palms that offered more flowers, whereas others were associated with palms that offered less. Two bee species may be able to mediate long-distance pollen-flow for E. edulis: an undetermined species of Euglossini and Apis mellifera. Frugivorous birds were not influenced by any of the factors investigated. Birds of the genus Turdus predominated in the assemblage and were responsible for most of the interactions. This is probably due to the fact that, unlike larger birds, species of Turdus are considered resilient to environmental disturbances. Due to the continuous defaunation and fragmentation of the Atlantic Forest, the number of large birds that can promote long-distance seed dispersal is declining, with implications for the genetic diversity of E. edulis. Measures to restore the population density of E. edulis will likely favor the recovery of its genetic diversity due to its high capacity for distant pollen dispersal.

The essence of these processes is the movement of propagules from a parental tree to the site of propagule establishment. The estimation of plant dispersal kernels has remained challenging due to the difficulty of making direct observations. We estimated the dispersal capacity of the endangered palm Euterpe edulis, whose seeds are dispersed by vertebrates and pollen by insects. Methods: We used a hierarchical Bayesian model with genetic data from reproductive plants, juveniles, and embryos to estimate dispersal kernels. Our analyses account for genotyping error and uncertainty in parental assignment. Key Results: We found that seeds were dispersed at most a few hundred meters, but pollen was dispersed up to several kilometers. We hypothesize that this long-distance pollen dispersal is generated mainly by euglossine bees, whereas the main dispersal vectors for short-distance seed dispersal are thrushes. The long-distance dispersal of pollen suggests a high level of gene flow that should maintain genetic diversity of E. edulis. Despite the relation between long-distance dispersal and genetic diversity, we observed low genetic diversity and inbreeding within the local population, which are probably due to restricted gene flow due to the low density of this population and its aggregated spatial distribution. Conclusions: We conclude that if conservation actions are able to restore the population density of E. edulis, the recovery of its genetic diversity will be facilitated because of its high dispersal capacity, especially with regard to pollen. © 2018 Botanical Society of America","estimating seed and pollen dispersal kernels from genetic data demonstrates","Premise of the Study: Seed and pollen dispersal are key"

Evidence from large birds (m(b) > 0.9 kg) suggests that soaring-gliding is considerably cheaper in terms of energy than flapping flight, and costs about two to three times the basal metabolic rate (BMR). Yet, soaring-gliding is considered unfavorable for small birds because migration speed in small birds during soaring-gliding is believed to be lower than that of flapping flight. Nevertheless, several small bird species routinely soar and glide. Methodology/Principal Findings: To estimate the energetic cost of soaring-gliding flight in small birds, we measured heart beat frequencies of free-ranging migrating European bee-eaters (Merops apiaster, m(b) similar to 55 g) using radio telemetry, and established the relationship between heart beat frequency and metabolic rate (by indirect calorimetry) in the laboratory. Heart beat frequency during sustained soaring-gliding was 2.2 to 2.5 times lower than during flapping flight, but similar to, and not significantly different from, that measured in resting birds. We estimated that soaring-gliding metabolic rate of European bee-eaters is about twice their basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is similar to the value estimated in the black-browed albatross Thalassarche (previously Diomedea) melanophrys, m(b) similar to 4 kg). We found that soaring-gliding migration speed is not significantly different from flapping migration speed. Conclusions/Significance: We found no evidence that soaring-gliding speed is slower than flapping flight in bee-eaters, contradicting earlier estimates that implied a migration speed penalty for using soaring-gliding rather than flapping flight. Moreover, we suggest that small birds soar and glide during migration, breeding, dispersal, and other stages in their annual cycle because it may entail a low energy cost of transport. We propose that the energy cost of soaring-gliding may be proportional to BMR regardless of bird size, as theoretically deduced by earlier studies.","flight modes in migrating european bee-eaters: heart rate may indicate","Background: Many avian species soar and glide over land.

Pollinator-dependent crops rely on mobile animals like bees for crop production, and the spatial relationship between floral resources and nest location for these central-place foragers influences the delivery of pollination services. Current models that map pollination coverage in agricultural regions utilize landscape-level estimates of floral availability and nesting incidence inferred from expert opinion, rather than direct assessments. Foraging distance is often derived from proxies of bee body size, rather than direct measurements of foraging that account for behavioral responses to floral resource type and distribution. The lack of direct measurements of nesting incidence and foraging distances may lead to inaccurate mapping of pollination services. We examined the role of local-scale floral resource presence from hedgerow plantings on nest incidence of ground-nesting bees in field margins and within monoculture, conventionally managed sunflower fields in California's Central Valley. We tracked bee movement into fields using fluorescent powder. We then used these data to simulate the distribution of pollination services within a crop field. Contrary to expert opinion, we found that ground-nesting native bees nested both in fields and edges, though nesting rates declined with distance into field. Further, we detected no effect of field-margin floral enhancements on nesting. We found evidence of an exponential decay rate of bee movement into fields, indicating that foraging predominantly occurred in less than 1% of medium-sized bees' predicted typical foraging range. Although we found native bees nesting within agricultural fields, their restricted foraging movements likely centralize pollination near nest sites. Our data thus predict a heterogeneous distribution of pollination services within sunflower fields, with edges receiving higher coverage than field centers. To generate more accurate maps of services, we advocate directly measuring the autecology of ecosystem service providers, which vary by crop system, pollinator species, and region. Improving estimates of the factors affecting pollinator populations can increase the accuracy of pollination service maps and help clarify the influence of farming practices on wild bees occurring in agricultural landscapes. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","sunflower (helianthus annuus) pollination in california's central valley is limited","The delivery of ecosystem services by mobile organisms depends on"

We monitored bumblebee populations (Bombus spp.) in 14 grassland patches incorporated into the agricultural habitat mosaic in the Mezofold region, Hungary. We asked how bumblebee populations were affected by local vegetation quality and the presence of various landscape elements, including fields in agri-environmental schemes, at various spatial scales. A stratified analysis revealed that vegetation quality, especially the lack of weeds, was the most important local factor that positively affected both bumblebee abundance and species number. We found no significant landscape scale effects between 50-250 m. Between 500-1000 m grassland area in the landscape had consistently significant positive effect on species richness. At the 2 km scale the extent of arable fields had a negative impact on both abundance and richness. A higher percentage area of arable fields in the landscape participating in agri-environmental schemes had no positive effect on bumblebee abundance or species richness. Considering all local and landscape effects and their possible interactions, model selection and variance partitioning revealed that local factors were the most important determinants of bumblebee richness and abundance. Local and landscape factors had high shared variance but did not interact with each other. The present study indicated that small scale landscape composition had the lowest importance, but larger scale landscape composition was significant, most likely because bumblebees can forage far from their nests. If we are able to provide good quality grassland patches incorporated into the agricultural habitat mosaic, then we can build on the strong spill over propensity of bumblebees and can expect their contribution to the pollination of various crops.","the role of local and landscape level factors in determining","Wild bees are important contributors to the pollination ecosystem service,"

This study was carried out over a period of 2 years (July 2012 to June 2014) in the arid agricultural landscape of Pothwar Plateau, Pakistan, to identify adaptations that govern bird distribution and abundance across 2 different cropping systems associated with differences in water availability. We used regular surveys and foraging observations to quantify species abundance, distribution, and habits. We then examined morphological correlations with ecological attributes. We found the following: (1) larger birds tended to spend more time in trees; (2) birds with small beaks and relatively long wings more commonly forage on the ground; (3) birds with narrow and long beaks and long tarsi were more likely to be insectivorous in habits. Of these associations, only the third axis, bill stubbiness and short tarsus, correlated with feeding on crops, implying that feeding on plant material is one preadaptation to crop exploitation. Bird abundance was not correlated with feeding on crops. This is because some common species are crop exploiters, but other common species feed on secondary growth (e.g., bulbuls, Pycnonotus spp.) or may be common in this region even in the absence of humans (e.g., the green bee-eater, Merops orientalis). The best predictor of distribution was not crop-feeding but abundance. This appears to be because common species feed on a set of resources that are common everywhere, whereas range-restricted species are found in areas with water—but even in these areas, water is scarce. © 2018, Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences.

Here, we test for pollination by mimicry in Diuris (Orchidaceae), a genus hypothesized to attract pollinators via mimicry of a range of co-occurring pea plants (Faboideae). Methods: Observations of pollinator behaviour were made for Diuris brumalis using arrays of orchid flowers. An analysis of floral traits in the co-flowering community and spectral reflectance measurements were undertaken to test if Di. brumalis and the pea plants showed strong similarity and were likely to be perceived as the same by bees. Pollen removal and fruit-set were recorded at 18 sites over two years to test if fitness of Di. brumalis increased with the abundance of the model species. Key Results: Diuris brumalis shares the pollinator species Trichococolletes capillosus and T. leucogenys (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) with co-flowering Faboideae from the genus Daviesia. On Di. brumalis, Trichocolletes exhibited the same stereotyped food-foraging and mate-patrolling behaviour that they exhibit on Daviesia. Diuris and pea plants showed strong morphological similarity compared to the co-flowering plant community, while the spectral reflectance of Diuris was similar to that of Daviesia spp. Fruit-set and pollen removal of Di. brumalis was highest at sites with a greater number of Daviesia flowers. Conclusions: Diuris brumalis is pollinated by mimicry of co-occurring congeneric Faboideae species. Evidence for mimicry of multiple models, all of which share pollinator species, suggests that this may represent a guild mimicry system. Interestingly, Di. brumalis belongs to a complex of species with similar floral traits, suggesting that this represents a useful system for investigating speciation in lineages that employ mimicry of food plants.","masquerading as pea plants: behavioural and morphological evidence for mimicry","Background and Aims: While there is increasing recognition of Batesian"

A 1 m circle of non-transgenic plants was sown in the centre of the transgenic area to allow estimation of the level of pollen dispersal when plants were in close contact. Honeybee hives were placed at the trial site to optimize the opportunity for cross-pollination. During the flowering period, regular observations were made of the number of plants flowering and the number and type of insects present in 60 1 m2 areas. These areas were located uniformly around the plot at distances of 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 47 m from the edge of the 9 m circle of transgenic plants. Seed samples were harvested from each of the 7 distances so that approximately 20% of the circumference of the plot was sampled at each distance. The centre non-transgenic circle was also sampled. Plants were grown from the seed samples and sprayed with glufosinate to estimate the frequency of pollen dispersal at each distance. In order to screen enough samples to detect low frequency cross-pollination events, seed samples were tested in the greenhouse and on a larger scale in the field. Results were confirmed by testing progeny for glufosinate resistance and by Southern blot analysis. The estimated percentage of pollen dispersal in the non-transgenic centre circle was 4.8%.

Thirty minutes after feeding, bees with high gustatory responsiveness had a significantly higher protein kinase A activity than bees with low responsiveness. Ninety minutues after feeding, when gustatory responsiveness had increased in initially unresponsive bees, no changes in protein kinase A activity were found. We also tested time-dependent effects of protein kinase A activator and protein kinase A inhibitor on gustatory responsiveness. Injection of the protein kinase A activator adenosine 3′5′-cyclic monophosphate 8-bromosodium salt or of the protein kinase A inhibitor KT 5720 did not affect gustatory responsiveness within the first 4 h after treatment. Feeding of adenosine 3′5′-cyclic monophosphate 8-bromo-sodium salt over 4 days increased gustatory responsiveness in newly emerged bees and adult foragers. These results enable us to distinguish between two different forms of gustatory responsiveness: basal and transient gustatory responsiveness. Basal gustatory responsiveness correlates with protein kinase A activity and can only be modulated in the range of several days.

In this study, we examine diploidy as well as regional and local spatial genetic structure using males of Bombus vosnesenskii, a stable bumble bee species found across western North America. Specifically, we investigate patterns of genetic structure in both island and mainland populations, across spatial scales, and over a range of natural and human-altered habitats. We document high levels of male diploidy, with significantly higher levels in mainland populations compared to island populations and increasing diploidy in areas with poor nesting habitat.

Metabolic rates of individuals are measured in a running tube respirometer while they are unladen and laden at 25°C. Workers voluntarily collect a load of 6 μL of a 30% sucrose solution (mass = 6.8 mg), which results in an internal load of about 50% of the ant mass and is close to a full load for ants within this size range. The gross cost of unladen running is 264 J kg-1 m-1, while that of laden running is 225 J kg -1 m-1. The mass used to calculate the cost of laden running includes body mass of ant and load carried. Load carriage cost in C. rufipes foragers is calculated to be about 60% as much as body carriage per unit mass. Internal load carriage in C. rufipes is energetically cheaper compared with external carriage in other ant species.

In the laboratory, individual workers were trained to visit an artificial feeder that provided a sucrose solution of 1%, 5%, 10%, 30% or 50% at controlled flows, in a similar span range to those observed in natural nectar sources. We measured foraging times, nectar loads collected, and CO2 production during actual feeding, as an indication of the energy expenditure for a single forager. Results show an increase in individual metabolic rates with increasing flow rate of sugar solution, but no dependence on sucrose concentration. This increase in metabolic expenditure does not depend on the crop load attained while feeding, as intuitively expected, and is therefore a result of an increased activity brought about by the food-source profitability experienced by the forager. The energy gained during collection of sugar solution is always higher than the energy spent by the ant. Even with a food source of lower quality than a natural source, the ants gain ca. tenfold of what they spend. Based on a simplified model, we calculated that foragers of C. rufipes could travel from 0.5 to 9 km with the energy gained in a single foraging trip only. These results suggest that decreasing foraging time is more important than increasing individual energetic efficiency when workers of the nectar-feeding ant C. rufipes decide to stop drinking and return to the nest with partial crop loads.","foraging energetics of a nectar-feeding ant: metabolic expenditure as a","We examined the quantitative relationship between the energetic costs and"

Bombus terrestris, in particular, has spread by some 200 km year-1 and had reached the Atlantic coast in Argentina by the end of 2011. Both species, and especially B. terrestris, are infected by protozoan parasites that seem to spread along with the imported hosts and spillover to native species. Genetic analyses by polymorphic microsatellite loci suggest that the host population of B. terrestris is genetically diverse, as expected from a large invading founder population, and structured through isolation by distance. Genetically, the populations of the trypanosomatid parasite, Crithidia bombi, sampled in 2004 are less diverse, and distinct from the ones sampled later. Current C. bombi populations are highly heterozygous and also structured through isolation by distance correlating with the genetic distances of B. terrestris, suggesting the latter's expansion to be a main structuring factor for the parasite.

Furthermore, we show that all identified peptide families are present in the central brain and ventral ganglia of C. fortis whereas in the retrocerebral complex only sNPF could be detected. Immunofluorescence staining against AstA, AT, and TK in the brain revealed arborizations of AstA- and TK-positive neurons in primary sensory processing centers and higher order integration centers, whereas AT immunoreactivity was restricted to the central complex, the antennal mechanosensory and motor center, and the protocerebrum. For artificially dark-kept ants, we found that TK distribution changed markedly in the central complex from days 1 and 7 to day 14 after eclosion. Based on functional studies in Drosophila, this age-related variation of TK is suggestive of a modulatory role in locomotion behavior in C. fortis. We conclude that the general distribution and age-related changes in neuropeptides indicate a modulatory role in sensory input regions and higher order processing centers in the desert ant brain. J.

Since they exhibit systemic properties, exposure of bees may occur as a result of residues present in the nectar and/or pollen of seed- or soil-treated crop plants and so they have been the subject of much debate about whether they cause adverse effects in pollinating insects under field conditions. Due to these perceived concerns, the use of the three neonicotinoids imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam has been temporarily suspended in the European Union for seed treatment, soil application and foliar treatment in crops attractive to bees. Monitoring data from a number of countries are available to assess the presence of neonicotinoid residues in honey bee samples and possible impacts at the colony level and these are reviewed here together with a number of field studies which have looked at the impact of clothiandin on honey bees in relation to specific crop use and in particular with oilseed rape. Currently there is considerable uncertainty with regards to the regulatory testing requirements for field studies. Accordingly, a testing protocol was developed to address any acute and chronic risks from oilseed rape seeds containing a coating with 10 g clothianidin and 2 g beta-cyfluthrin per kg seeds (Elado®) for managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies, commercially bred bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) colonies and red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) as a representative solitary bee species.

African and hybrid colonies did not differ significantly in population size, the areas of comb devoted to brood rearing and food storage, flight activity, pollen foraging activity, or the distances traveled to pollen and nectar sources.

Conversely, such genetically determined preferences may have been expressed, but African-like preferences may have been dominant within both colony types. However, while no significant differences were observed, colonies with African mtDNA maintained slightly greater levels of brood rearing, had 1.5 times the level of pollen foraging activity, and traveled on the average 600 m less per round trip of foraging.

Prior to absconding, waggle dances regularly communicated distances up to 10-20 km from the nests. However, compared to waggle dances observed during nonabsconding periods, those occurring prior to migration were less associated with food sources, occurred during periods of little or no flight activity, and exhibited great variability in the communication of distance by consecutive waggle runs of individual bees. It is therefore unlikely that ""migration dances"" communicated the locations of, or stimulated immediate recruitment for, specific foraging or nesting sites. Rather, the dances may have functioned to establish a general route of travel. The majority of migration dances observed were oriented in an easterly direction, and upon departure both colonies traveled towards the E-SE. The orientation of migration dances occurred independently of the directions communicated by waggle dances associated with past foraging success or the sampling of alternate foraging areas. Migration dance orientation may have been affected by prevailing wind directions, because during the migration period winds blew primarily from the east. However, it is unlikely that wind direction was the only factor influencing migration dance orientation. The lack of immediate flight activity associated with migration dance performance suggests the dances may have gradually prepared colonies for migratory movement by conveying a message to fly for a long, but unspecified distance in a certain direction. Waggle dances associated with migration may therefore function differently from those associated with foraging and nest site selection, which convey both the distance and direction to specific locations. © 1994 Birkhäuser Verlag.","waggle dance behavior associated with seasonal absconding in colonies of","Waggle dance activity associated with seasonal absconding (migration) was investigated"

Four observation colonies were studied during the honey bee migration season (November-May), at which time the availability of blooming species was reduced. Two of the colonies (colonies 1 & 2) migrated during the study period, while the remaining two (colonies 3 & 4) did not. During the 4-6 weeks preceding the onset of migration preparations, colonies 1 & 2 exhibited increasing population sizes, high levels of brood production with low brood mortality, relatively large stores of food, and increasing mass. In contrast, the populations of colonies 3 & 4 did not increase, brood-rearing activity was erratic and lower, brood mortality was higher, food stores became depleted and colony mass declined. Both colonies 3 & 4 ceased rearing brood, and colony 3 died of starvation. Colony foraging activity was examined by monitoring waggle-dance activity 2-3 days each week. For 4-6 weeks before the onset of migration in colonies 1 & 2, daily foraging areas and mean daily foraging distances became increasingly large and variable. Colonies 3 & 4 exhibited foraging patterns similar to those observed for colonies 1 & 2 preceding migration. There was no clear association between 7 weather parameters examined and migration behavior. These data suggest that migration is influenced by an interaction of intra-colony demographics, food reserves and foraging patterns. Migration may be feasible only for those colonies that possess (1) a population of appropriate size and age structure to compensate for the natural attrition of older workers during the emigration process, and (2) sufficient food reserves for long-distance travel and the establishment of a new nest. Changing foraging patterns may reflect a deteriorating foraging environment, which may trigger the onset of migration preparations, provided that colony demographics and food reserves are conducive. Colonies that show decreased brood production, higher brood mortality and reduced food stores may be incapable of migrating, even when experiencing deteriorating foraging conditions. Rather, such colonies may have a greater chance of survival if they attempt to persist in a given area. © 1992 Birkhäuser Verlag.","factors influencing seasonal absconding in colonies of the african honey","This study investigated the effects of colony growth and development,"

Bees could exit the gangway through one of two or three side exits installed at different distances from the gangway entrance. In one set of experiments, the substrate on which the bees walked was moved either in the bee's direction or against it. In another set of experiments, the substrate was stationary, but the pattern was moved in one or the other direction. The bee's walking speed (WS) was evaluated from the video tapes. When the substrate moved against, or the pattern in the bee's direction, in either case decreasing the speed of pattern flow (PFS), the bees increased WS, and, at the same time, they preferred the more distant exit. When the substrate moved in, or the pattern against the bee's direction, thus increasing PFS, WS decreased and the bees preferred the nearer exit. These results suggest that the speed of optic flow controls the speed of locomotion and might therefore also serve for assessing the distance travelled.","optokinetic speed control and estimation of travel distance in walking","Honeybees returning from foraging trips were video-filmed while they walked"

We established a total of 15 arrays of potted plants isolated by 50-400 m from ten natural ""source"" populations, as well as control arrays embedded within each source. Flowers on potted plants were emasculated, so any pollen received could be assumed to come from source populations. A total of 69 h of observation suggested that pollinators were somewhat less abundant in isolates than in controls, but visited more plants and flowers once within an isolate. Consistent with this, 82.1% of all flowers in isolated arrays received pollen, versus 87.7% in controls. Mean receipt was more than 100 pollen grains per flower in most arrays, and seed set in isolates and controls respectively averaged 69.8% and 74.3% of ovules. Furthermore, pollen receipt in isolates declined relatively slowly with distance from the source. We conclude that pollinators of D. nuttallianum often will fly up to 400 m among populations, and that substantial pollination ensues.

Glass-walled observation hives enable researchers to observe or video, and decode waggle runs. However, variation in these signals makes it impossible to determine exact locations advertised. We present a Bayesian duration to distance calibration curve using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations that allows us to quantify how accurately distance to a food resource can be predicted from waggle run durations within a single dance. An angular calibration shows that angular precision does not change over distance, resulting in spatial scatter proportional to distance.

Aerial photographs were used to detect and map fields of blooming OSR in eight 20 × 20 kilometers2 areas across England where OSR is grown. We determined the distance to the nearest OSR field for randomly chosen positions (i.e., potential hive locations) using a digital map made of each area. The proportion of colonies within foraging range to the nearest OSR field in each area was then calculated using published data on honeybee foraging distances obtained by waggle dance decoding. We found that the distribution of distances to the nearest OSR field varied greatly among study areas, ranging from almost all colonies being within range to almost all being out of range (6–79% were within median foraging distance). In one study area, we examined changes over a 4-year period and found little year-to-year variation due to crop rotation (23–36% within median foraging distance).

One past approach has been to reduce noise. Lately, with the advance of quantitative tools, an alternative is to use the noise to improve model predictions. Here we take the latter approach to improve our ability to recover honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) foraging locations, in particular the distance at which they forage, from observed waggle dance communications, which encode the vector from the hive to the forage. This vector gives both the distance from the hive to the forage, which is encoded in dance duration, and the direction from the hive to the forage, which is encoded in the angle that the bee makes while dancing. We analysed the waggle dances from individually marked honey bees (N = 859 dances from 85 bees from 3 hives) that foraged at multiple known locations to determine a distance-to-duration calibration. Next we compared this calibration to a previously published calibration, which demonstrated that while their slopes were similar (P = 0.82), their intercepts differed (P < 0.001); however, the individual variation, or noise, between bees was so high that this difference was rendered biologically irrelevant. We then collated our data with all published calibration studies to generate a universal calibration that incorporates the interindividual and interstudy differences. Lastly, we verified that the universal calibration performed as well as a landscape/subspecies-specific calibration, first with a hold-out sample of waggle dances (N = 84) (performance comparison: P = 0.36) and second with a linear discriminant analysis, which failed to assign dances to their originating population. Both results confirm that the universal calibration may be used, irrespective of landscape or subspecies. Therefore, by allowing noise to be part of our analysis, the usability of our calibration is broadened for use in future settings. © 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","dismantling babel: creation of a universal calibration for honey bee","Noisy animal communication presents a unique challenge for biologists interpreting"

Path integration and view-based landmark guidance are the key strategies for the ants' navigation. For instance, they memorise different views in a sequence (sequential memory) but also have a step counter that informs them about the covered distance during each foraging trip (odometer). The sequential memory and the odometer information can act as contextual cues during travel for retrieving the appropriate stored view. When and which cue is used at different stages and lengths of the foraging trips is still unknown. In this study, we examined how the Australian desert ant Melophorus bagoti uses sequential memory and odometric information to retrieve visual memories. Using a set-up made out of channels and two-choice boxes (Y-mazes), we demonstrate first that M. bagoti foragers are able to learn and discriminate a variety of visual stimuli in a sequence of views along the inbound trip back to the nest. We then forced the homing ants to encounter a fixed sequence of two visual patterns during their inbound trips. By manipulating the position and distance of the visual stimuli and decision boxes, we could set the two contextual cues (sequential memory and odometer) into conflict.

In landscapes influenced by anthropogenic activities, such as intensive agriculture, knowledge of the relative importance and interaction of environmental factors on the composition and function of local communities across a range of spatial scales is important for maintaining biodiversity. 2. We analysed five arthropod taxa covering a broad range of functional aspects (wild bees, true bugs, carabid beetles, hoverflies and spiders) in 24 landscapes (4x4 km) across seven European countries along gradients of both land-use intensity and landscape structure. Species-environment relationships were examined in a hierarchical design of four main sets of environmental factors (country, land-use intensity, landscape structure, local habitat properties) that covered three spatial scales (region, landscape, local) by means of hierarchical variability partitioning using partial canonical correspondence analyses. 3. Local community composition and the distribution of body size classes and trophic guilds were most affected by regional processes, which highly confounded landscape and local factors. After correcting for regional effects, factors at the landscape scale dominated over local habitat factors. Land-use intensity explained most of the variability in species data, whereas landscape characteristics (especially connectivity) accounted for most of the variability in body size and trophic guilds. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that management effort should be focused on land-use intensity and habitat connectivity in order to enhance diversity in agricultural landscapes. Since these factors are largely independent, specific conservation programmes may be developed with regards to socio-economic and agri-environmental requirements. Changes in either of these factors will enhance diversity but will also result in specific effects on local communities related to dispersal ability and the resource use of species. © 2005 British Ecological Society.","quantifying the impact of environmental factors on arthropod communities in","1.

By using experimental plots of Brassica rapa plants infested with generalist (Mamestra brassicae) and specialised (Pieris brassicae) native herbivores and with a generalist invasive (Spodoptera littoralis) herbivore, we estimated both pollen movement among treatments and the visiting behaviour of honeybees versus other wild pollinators. Overall, we found that herbivory has weak effects on plant pollen export, either in terms of inter-treatment movements or of dispersion distance. Plants infested with the native specialised herbivore tend to export less pollen to other plants with the same treatment. Other wild pollinators preferentially visit non-infested plants that differ from those of honeybees, which showed no preferences. Honeybees and other wild pollinators also showed different behaviours on plants infested with different herbivores, with the former tending to avoid revisiting the same treatment and the latter showing no avoidance behaviour. When taking into account the whole pollinator community, i.e. the interactive effects of honeybees and other wild pollinators, we found an increased avoidance of plants infested by the native specialised herbivore and a decreased avoidance of plants infested by the invasive herbivore. Taken together, our results suggest that herbivory may have an effect on B. rapa pollination, but this effect depends on the relative abundance of honeybees and other wild pollinators.","do native and invasive herbivores have an effect on brassica","Mutualistic (e.g. pollination) and antagonistic (e.g. herbivory) plant-insect interactions shape"

The absence of morphological diagnostic characters for the identification of some species creates difficulties for basic ecological studies, and for conservation management. The widespread and commercially exploited bumblebee subgenus Bombus sensu stricto contains a cryptic species complex, known as the lucorum complex, which in Europe comprises B. lucorum, B. cryptarum and B. magnus. Little is known about these species and much of what has been reported is likely to have suffered from incorrect identification. Although the lucorum complex as a whole is common in Great Britain, we aimed to determine whether the populations of the individual species are vulnerable and require conservation action. Using genetic methods to distinguish them, we determined the geographic distribution and abundance of the lucorum complex species in Great Britain, and assessed the extent of niche differentiation between these species. We detected major differences in the geographic range, forage use and sensitivity to summer temperatures of the three species. Bombus lucorum was found to have the broadest distribution and diet, being present throughout mainland Great Britain, whereas B. cryptarum and B. magnus were absent from large areas of central and southern England. Bombus cryptarum and B. magnus were more likely to be found at sites with lower summer temperatures. Bombus magnus, the least abundant species, was found to exhibit an unusually tight biotope association with heathland habitat.

A nectar forager grades her behavior toward a patch in response to both the nectar intake rate of her colony and the quality of her patch. This results in the threshold in patch quality for acceptance of a patch being higher when the colonial intake rate of nectar is high than when it is low. Thus colonies can adjust their patch selectivity so that they focus on rich sources when forage is abundant, but spread their workers among a wider range of sources when forage is scarce. Foragers assess their colony's rate of nectar intake while in the nest, unloading nectar to receiver bees. The ease of unloading varies inversely with the colonial intake rate of nectar. Foragers assess patch quality while in the field, collecting nectar. By grading their behavior steeply in relation to such patch variables as distance from the nest and nectar sweetness, foragers give their colony high sensitivity to differences in profitability among patches. When a patch's quality declines, its foragers reduce their rate of visits to the patch. This diminishes the flow of nectar from the poor patch which in turn stimulates recruitment to rich patches. Thus a colony can swiftly redistribute its forager force following changes in the spatial distribution of rich food sources. The fundamental currency of nectar patch quality is not net rate of energy intake, (Gain-Cost)/Time, but may be net energy efficiency, (Gain-Cost)/Cost. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.","social foraging by honeybees: how colonies allocate foragers among patches","To understand how a colony of honeybees keeps its forager"

This navigational strategy requires an egocentric monitoring of the foraging path by incrementally integrating direction, distance, and inclination of the path. Monitoring the latter two parameters involves idiothetic cues and hence is tightly coupled to the ant's locomotor behavior. Results: In a kinematic study of desert ant locomotion performed on differently inclined surfaces we aimed at pinpointing the relevant mechanisms of estimating step length and inclination. In a behavioral experiment with ants foraging on slippery surfaces we broke the otherwise tightly coupled relationship between stepping frequency and step length and examined the animals' ability to monitor distances covered even under those adverse conditions. We show that the ants' locomotor system is not influenced by inclined paths. After removing the effect of speed, slope had only marginal influence on kinematic parameters. Conclusion: From the obtained data we infer that the previously proposed monitoring of angles of the thorax-coxa joint is not involved in inclinometry. Due to the tiny variations in cycle period, we also argue that an efference copy of the central pattern generator coding the step length in its output frequency will most likely not suffice for estimating step length and complementing the pedometer. Finally we propose that sensing forces acting on the ant's legs could provide the desired neuronal correlate employed in monitoring inclination and step length.","walking on inclines: how do desert ants monitor slope and","Background: During long-distance foraging in almost featureless habitats desert ants"

Nectar is a resource that exists along a continuum of quality in terms of sugar concentration and is the primary energy source for bees. Alternative sugar sources exist, including fruit juice, which generally has lower energetic value than nectar. We observed many honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata) foraging on juice from fallen guava (Psidium guajava) fruit near others foraging on nectar. To investigate whether fruit and nectar offered contrasting benefits of quality and quantity, we compared honeybee foraging performance on P. guajava fruit versus two wildflowers growing within 50 m, Richardia brasiliensis and Tridax procumbens. Bees gained weight significantly faster on fruit, 2.72 mg/min, than on either flower (0.17 and 0.12 mg/min, respectively). However, the crop sugar concentration of fruit foragers was significantly lower than for either flower (12.4% vs. 37.0% and 22.7%, respectively). Fruit foragers also spent the most time handling and the least time flying, suggesting that fruit juice was energetically inexpensive to collect. We interpret honeybee foraging decisions in the context of existing foraging models and consider how nest-patch distance may be a key factor for central place foragers choosing between resources of contrasting quality and quantity. We also discuss how dilute solutions, such as fruit juice, can help maintain colony sugar–water balance. These results show the benefits of feeding on resources with contrasting quality and quantity and that even low-quality resources have value. © 2016 The Authors.

Since pollinator choice behavior is guided by how the pollinator perceives and evaluates floral rewards, we hypothesize that plants have evolved strategies that maximize their perceived profitability, through pollinator cognition-mediated coevolution. We focus on two classes of cognitive phenomena, context-dependent evaluations and risk-sensitivity. These phenomena are of interest to psychologists and biologists. Our paper is an attempt to show the value of cross-disciplinary exchange of theories and ideas. A review of the ecology literature suggests that pollinators evaluate variability in nectar volume in proportion to the mean, and thus choice behavior is guided by the coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean) of the distribution. This functional relationship is predicted by Weber's law, which describes a wide range of psychophysical phenomena. Simulations show that this phenomenon also affects how pollinators perceive skewed nectar distributions. Cognition-mediated coevolution theory should be a fruitful approach to understanding the evolution of pollinator-plant interactions.","cognition-mediated coevolution - context-dependent evaluations and sensitivity of pollinators to","In this paper we emphasize the role of pollinator perception"

Of particular interest is whether similar dimensions are compared to each other or whether each alternative is assigned an absolute value (utility). We assumed that choice proportions would follow Weber's effect, according to which discrimination is proportional to relative difference (difference/mean). We tested honey bees in a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) paradigm of proboscis-extension response (PER) conditioning. Subjects were conditioned over six trials to associate each of two odours with sucrose solution rewards and then tested in a choice trial between the two alternatives. Each group of subjects was tested in one treatment, and there were four treatments in each of six experiments. Rewards differed in delay, duration of feeding, and sucrose concentration. In each treatment, the high-profitability alternative was better than the low-profitability alternative along a single dimension, but between treatments of each experiment values in another dimension monotonically increased. Proboscis-response proportions during the conditioning phase tended to be greater for the high-profitability alternative, and choice proportions for it in the choice phase ranged between 0.72 and 0.89 in the 24 treatments. We show for the first time that harnessed bees are sensitive to reward delay. Preferences did not differ statistically between the different treatments of any of the experiments. The results support comparative evaluation of alternatives and are pertinent to multi-attribute choice, with implications for context-dependent preferences. We also discuss the potential advantages of the 2AFC PER simultaneous choice assay.","comparative evaluations of reward dimensions in honey bees: evidence from","A major challenge in understanding choice behaviour is determining how"

We examined the possible degree of competition between honeybees and native solitary bees by observing their foraging on focal nectariferous plants. Temporal introduction of hives increased the visitation frequencies of honeybees to our focal plants and decreased the overall average visitation frequencies of native solitary bees. However, the effect of honeybees varied among native bee species, focal plants, and years. In some cases, honeybees had a negative effect on visitation rates of the other bees, while in other cases we did not find such an effect. The other bees also did not shift to forage on other flowering plants, and did not change their temporal activity pattern as a response to increased foraging by honeybees. The results provide partial evidence for behavioral competition between honeybees and native bees.

Here we present a comprehensive synthesis of C. smaragdula's known biological and ecological history, as well as a population genetic analysis of C. smaragdula from Maui, and from locations across its native range, at the cytochrome oxidase I (C01) locus. We update C. smaragdula's known distribution and occurrence elevation in Hawai'i and reveal a lack of genetic structure between Hawaiian and native range populations. We discuss points of origin, means of introduction, and potential ecological impact of this nonnative pollinator.","range expansion of the small carpenter bee ceratina smaragdula across","Invasive bee species may have a widely detrimental impact on"

Technological advances have opened up the prospect of applying state-of-the-art radio frequency (RF) technologies for automatic data acquisition in construction engineering. This paper proposes a cost-effective, ZigBee-based wireless sensor networks (WSN) solution for automated resource tracking on construction sites. A prototype of the ZigBee WSN was developed in house, consisting of a group of stationary and mobile nodes that can communicate with one another. For concept proving and performance evaluation, field trials of the ZigBee WSN system were carried out on two construction sites in Hong Kong, including a high-rise building and an open-trench for laying down 315 mm-diameter polyethylene (PE) pipeline. In the field experiments, multiple stationary nodes were fixed at pre-defined locations on site. Real time ranges of a mobile node in relation to each stationary node were estimated by applying the localization methodology of received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Practical performances of the ZigBee-based WSN under realistic construction environments are discussed, and recommendations made for future research.","field evaluation of zigbee-based wireless sensor networks for automated resource","Automation systems for positioning and tracking construction resources, such as"

We carried out tests (1) under a blue sky or in total overcast conditions in the field, and (2) with a view of the sun or with a non-polarized light within a box in the laboratory. The ants' paths were recorded, and then analysed by means of circular and linear statistics. Ant workers with food were able to home directly under a blue sky, under totally overcast skies, and even under non-polarized lighting. In a fifth test we displaced the ants at the beginning of the homing trip; they returned to the presumed nest location along a path that ran parallel to the true homing vector, as if they had not been displaced. The results suggest that the ants home by dead reckoning, that is, they can measure directional changes and distances travelled during the outward trip, and integrate them into a mean home vector for direct homing depending on an external light-based reference system, that is, either the polarized skylight pattern or non-polarized lighting.

Attributes of resilience, adaptability and vigour which engender the hybrids for wood production, may also exacerbate the risk they present from gene flow to native species gene pools or to local ecologies as weeds. To determine the biological and genetic factors that influence the extent of hybridisation, we examine the distribution and genealogy of wildlings surrounding plantings of locally-exotic Corymbia torelliana (Section Cadageria) near native C. henryi (Section Maculatae) in northern New South Wales. Our study showed pre-mating and pre- and post-zygotic barriers were incomplete, with in situ generation and natural establishment of both F1 hybrids (n=3) and advanced generation hybrids under the disturbed conditions bordering native forest. As hybrids were located on alluvial flats exposed to frost, they also likely have an extended ecological range relative to native C. henryi. Despite the likely generation of large viable seed crops on F1 trees at the site over many years, establishment success and survival of advanced generation hybrids may be low, as only 5 immature and no mature advanced generation hybrids were identified. Propagation and genetic analysis of a seed crop from one F1 wildling showed early survival and vigour of seedlings in cultivation was high, and that at least for some F1 in some seasons, backcrossing to the recurrent native C. henryi parent is favoured (60%), whereas selfing (10%) and crossing with other F1 (30%) was less frequent. Transport of seed by stingless bees probably accounted for long distance dispersal from C. torelliana, but this mechanism does not appear to supplement gravity-dispersal of seed from the F1. Coupled with other evidence from studies of bee behaviour, controlled pollination in Corymbia sp., and long-term fitness in second generation eucalypt hybrids, we anticipate gene flow via pollen rather than seed will be the greater challenge for managing the risk of introgression of C. torelliana ancestry into native species from the planted F1 hybrid. If large sources of F1 pollen become available to compete with native pollen, gene flow will probably be frequent and hybrids may establish in disturbed conditions and in habitats beyond the ecological range of their native parent. Further study is needed to determine the degree to which outbreeding depression and poor survival inhibits on-going gene flow. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","gene flow from corymbia hybrids in northern new south wales","Some of the most productive taxa for forestry are interspecific"

Here we ask how acute exposure to 50 Hz ELF EMFs at levels ranging from 20-100 mu T, found at ground level below powerline conductors, to 1000-7000 mu T, found within 1 m of the conductors, affects honey bee olfactory learning, flight, foraging activity and feeding. ELF EMF exposure was found to reduce learning, alter flight dynamics, reduce the success of foraging flights towards food sources, and feeding. The results suggest that 50 Hz ELF EMFs emitted from powerlines may represent a prominent environmental stressor for honey bees, with the potential to impact on their cognitive and motor abilities, which could in turn reduce their ability to pollinate crops.","extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields impair the cognitive and motor","Extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF EMF) pollution from overhead"

Tracking predatory insects presents a considerable challenge as they are often small, cryptic and highly mobile organisms. Using insect-borne pollen present either on the exoskeleton or within the gut, presents a useful technique by which the movements (spatial displacements) of insects can be determined, based on the distribution of flowering plants in the area, an appropriate pollen key or atlas, and an understanding of pollination ecology. Pollen has successfully been used to track the movement of bees and moths, but has rarely been used to track predatory insects. Since many predators are likely to encounter pollen as they forage on flowers, they are good candidates for this technique. In this review we examine two types of study that use pollen to track the movements of predatory insects: (a) those in which pollen from the surrounding landscape is used to assess habitat usage and short-term movement of generalist predators from a range of insect orders, and (b) those in which pollen from a known point-source is used to assess the movement and dispersal distance of the insects. We discuss the benefits and limitations of using pollen to determine the movement of predatory insects, and explain how the information derived can contribute to optimising the use of predatory insects within the agricultural landscape in integrated pest management programmes. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.","pollen grains as markers to track the movements of generalist","This special issue provides ample evidence why it is becoming"

Several of those species build their own nests, while others are reported as nest cleptoparasites. Here, the objective was to evaluate whether the inclusion of a strong biotic interaction, such as the presence of a host species, improved the ability of species distribution models (SDMs) to predict the geographic range of the cleptoparasite species. The target species were Aglaecaeruleaand its host species Eulaema nigrita. Additionally, since A. caerulea is more frequently found in the Amazon rather than the Cerrado areas, a secondary objective was to evaluate whether this species is increasing or decreasing its distribution given South American past and current climatic conditions. SDMs methods (Maxent and Bioclim), in addition with current and past South American climatic conditions, as well as the occurrences for A. caerulea and E. nigrita were used to generate the distribution models. The distribution of A. caerulea was generated with and without the inclusion of the distribution of E. nigrita as a predictor variable. The results indicate A. caerulea was barely affected by past climatic conditions and the populations from the Cerrado savanna could be at least 21,000 years old (the last glacial maximum), as well as the Amazonian ones. On the other hand, in this study, the inclusion of the host-cleptoparasite interaction complex did not statistically improve the quality of the produced models, which means that the geographic range of this cleptoparasite species is mainly constrained by climate and not by the presence of the host species. Nonetheless, this could also be caused by unknown complexes of other Euglossini hosts with A. caerulea, which still are still needed to be described by science. © 2015 Silva et al.

Particularly, the relatively large species of Melipona Illiger, 1806 would present variation in daily foraging activity very close to variation in relative humidity. In this study, we argue that the relative humidity is a confounding variable. In this same line of argumentation, it was also examined the role of pollen harvest on daily rhythm of foraging. The robust Melipona scutellaris (Latreille, 1811) was used as a model and the flight activity and pollen harvest along the day were measured in 12 colonies (4 colonies/habitat), in three types of habitats with varying rainfall, within the natural distribution range of this species (tropical rainforest, seasonal tropical forest and transition of tropical forest-savannah). Most of flight activity occurs during morning time in the three habitats. Colony foraging is high in the very early morning when the relative humidity is also high, and often associated with peaks of ollen harvest. Flight activity decreases abruptly during the high temperatures around noon time. The relationship between the flight activity and the relative humidity was highly significant and linear, in contrast to the unimodal and significant relationship with temperature. The relationship between the flight activity and the relative humidity is assumed to be contingent within humid tropical habitats, considering the daily microclimate variation and pollen foraging patterns. In particular, the latter pattern supports the hypothesis of temporal partitioning of pollen sources.","why do the stingless bee melipona scutellaris (hymenoptera, apidae) forage","There are evidences that air temperature and relative humidity exerts"

Evaluating ""multi-scale"" responses of species to landscape structure is an important framework to be considered, allowing insights about habitat requirements for different groups. We evaluated the response of Brazilian Cerrado's bees (eusocial vs. solitary ones) to both the amount and isolation of remnant vegetation in eight nested multiple-local scales. Response variables included abundance, observed, and estimated species richness, and beta diversity (split into nestedness and turnover resultant dissimilarities). Eusocial species' abundance responded to landscape structure at narrow scales of fragment isolation (250 m of radius from sampling sites), while solitary species' abundance responded to broader scales to fragment area (2000 m). Eusocial species nestedness also responded to landscape features in broader scales (1500 m), especially to increasing fragment isolation. However, all the remaining response variables did not respond to any other landscape variables in any spatial scale considered. Such contrasting responses of the abundances of eusocial vs. solitary species are related to the inherent life-history traits of each group. Important attributes in this context are different requirements on food resources, population features, and flight abilities. Species-specific dispersal abilities may be the main determinants of the nested patterns found for eusocial species at 1500 m. Considering these results, we suggest that different bee groups are considered separately in further landscape analyses, especially in other Brazilian biomes, for a better understanding of landscape effects on these organisms.","contrasting patterns in solitary and eusocial bees while responding to","Landscape structure is an important determinant of biological fluxes and"

Toads feeding around beehives travelled shorter distances per night, and hence used different microhabitats, than did toads from nearby control sites without beehives. The toads consumed live bees from the hive entrance (rather than dead bees from the ground), often climbing on top of one another to gain access to the hive entrance. Prey manipulation trials confirm that bee movement is the critical stimulus that elicits the toads’ feeding response; and in standardized trials, native frogs consumed bees less frequently than did toads.

Cane toads were the most frequent visitors to apiaries, followed by bandicoots and corvid birds. Cane toads at apiaries were more abundant and in better body condition (i. e., larger mass relative to snout-urostyle length) than were toads at nearby control sites. Toads at beehives contained more prey items per stomach (mostly bees, which were never recorded in the stomachs of toads from other sites), and adult female toads at beehives had larger livers and ovaries relative to body size. We conclude that commercial apiaries attract cane toads, influence their diets, and increase their feeding rates and reproductive capacity.

However, spatial and temporal patterns in the availability and quantity of these resources can be affected by disturbances like wildfire. The potential for spatial or temporal separation of foraging and nesting resources is of particular concern for solitary wood-cavity-nesting bees as they are central-place, short-distance foragers once they have established their nest. Often the importance of nesting resources for bees have been tested by sampling foraging bees as a proxy, and nesting bees have rarely been studied in a community context, particularly postdisturbance. We tested how wood-cavity-nesting bee species richness, nesting success, and nesting and floral resources varied across gradients of wildfire severity and time-since-burn. We sampled nesting bees via nesting boxes within four wildfires in southwest Montana, USA, using a space-for-time substitution chronosequence approach spanning 3–25 years postburn and including an unburned control. We found that bee nesting success and species richness declined with increasing time postburn, with a complete lack of successful bee nesting in unburned areas. Nesting and floral resources were highly variable across both burn severity and time-since-burn, yet generally did not have strong effects on nesting success. Our results together suggest that burned areas may provide important habitat for wood-cavity-nesting bees in this system.

A current frontier in community-level studies is the integration of these perspectives by investigating both simultaneously; one method for achieving this is evaluating the relative contributions of species turnover and host switching towards interaction turnover (i.e., the dissimilarity in interactions between two networks). We performed observations of plant-pollinator interactions to investigate (1) patterns in interaction turnover across spatial, temporal, and environmental gradients and (2) the relative contribution of pollinator species turnover, floral turnover, simultaneous pollinator & floral turnover, and host switching towards interaction turnover. Field work was conducted on the Beartooth Plateau, an alpine ecosystem in Montana and Wyoming, with weekly observations of plant-pollinator interactions across one growing season. Interaction turnover increased through time, with magnitudes consistently greater than 80%, even at time intervals as short as one week. Floral species turnover (41%) and simultaneous floral and pollinator species turnover (36%) accounted for almost all interaction turnover while host switching accounted for only 5%. Interaction turnover also significantly increased with spatial and elevational distance, albeit with lesser magnitudes than with temporal distance. The marginal spatial pattern was present for only some taxa (Bombus spp. and solitary bee species), potentially indicating variable habitat use by pollinators across the landscape. Weak environmental trends may be a consequence of unmeasured environmental variables, yet our finding that environmental gradients structure plant-pollinator interaction partitions had not previously been tested with empirical data.

Linum cratericola (Linaceae) was first discovered in 1966 at two sites on Floreana Island, Galápagos. It has since disappeared from one site and survives in three groups of plants at the other, where it has been threatened with extinction by introduced ungulates and invasive plants. Population size, and growth rate and mortality of individual plants, have been monitored since 1997. The population appears highly responsive to changes in threat levels: the three plant groups increased rapidly following protection by fencing and ungulate control, but temporarily declined when feral goat pressure increased and during dry periods. Natural factors that may contribute to population limitation include dry years, grazing by native snails and competition from native vascular plants and cryptogams. Linum cratericola has a single flowering period per year and produces abundant seed with 28% germination after scarification, but with no obvious adaptations for long-distance dispersal. Potential pollinators included the butterfly Leptotes parrhasioides, the hoverfly Toxomerus crockeri and the carpenter bee Xylocopa darwinii, all endemic to Galápagos.

Among honey bee pathogens, RNA viruses are emerging as a serious threat and are suspected as major contributors to CCD. Recent detection of these viral species in bumble bees suggests a possible wider environmental spread of these viruses with potential broader impact. It is therefore vital to study the ecology and epidemiology of these viruses in the hymenopteran pollinator community as a whole. We studied the viral distribution in honey bees, in their pollen loads, and in other non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators collected from flowering plants in Pennsylvania, New York, and Illinois in the United States. Viruses in the samples were detected using reverse transcriptase-PCR and confirmed by sequencing. For the first time, we report the molecular detection of picorna-like RNA viruses (deformed wing virus, sacbrood virus and black queen cell virus) in pollen pellets collected directly from forager bees. Pollen pellets from several uninfected forager bees were detected with virus, indicating that pollen itself may harbor viruses. The viruses in the pollen and honey stored in the hive were demonstrated to be infective, with the queen becoming infected and laying infected eggs after these virus- ontaminated foods were given to virus-free colonies. These viruses were detected in eleven other non-Apis hymenopteran species, ranging from many solitary bees to bumble bees and wasps. This finding further expands the viral host range and implies a possible deeper impact on the health of our ecosystem. Phylogenetic analyses support that these viruses are disseminating freely among the pollinators via the flower pollen itself. Notably, in cases where honey bee apiaries affected by CCD harbored honey bees with Israeli Acute Paralysis virus (IAPV), nearby non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators also had IAPV, while those near apiaries without IAPV did not. In containment greenhouse experiments, IAPV moved from infected honey bees to bumble bees and from infected bumble bees to honey bees within a week, demonstrating that the viruses could be transmitted from one species to another. This study adds to our present understanding of virus epidemiology and may help explain bee disease patterns and pollinator population decline in general. © 2010 Singh et al.","rna viruses in hymenopteran pollinators: evidence of inter-taxa virus transmission","Although overall pollinator populations have declined over the last couple"

Evidence is emerging that sublethal doses of these neurotoxins are affecting the learning and memory of both wild and managed bee colonies, exacerbating the negative effects of pesticide exposure and reducing individual foraging efficiency. Variation in methodologies and interpretation of results across studies has precluded the quantitative evaluation of these impacts that is needed to make recommendations for policy change. It is not clear whether robust effects occur under acute exposure regimes (often argued to be more field-realistic than the chronic regimes upon which many studies are based), for field-realistic dosages, and for pesticides other than neonicotinoids. Here we use meta-analysis to examine the impact of pesticides on bee performance in proboscis extension-based learning assays, the paradigm most commonly used to assess learning and memory in bees. We draw together 104 (learning) and 167 (memory) estimated effect sizes across a diverse range of studies. We detected significant negative effects of pesticides on learning and memory (i) at field realistic dosages, (ii) under both chronic and acute application, and (iii) for both neonicotinoid and non-neonicotinoid pesticides groups. We also expose key gaps in the literature that include a critical lack of studies on non-Apis bees, on larval exposure (potentially one of the major exposure routes), and on performance in alternative learning paradigms. Policy implications. Procedures for the registration of new pesticides within EU member states now typically require assessment of risks to pollinators if potential target crops are attractive to bees. However, our results provide robust quantitative evidence for subtle, sublethal effects, the consequences of which are unlikely to be detected within small-scale prelicensing laboratory or field trials, but can be critical when pesticides are used at a landscape scale.

Research has shown that acute, field realistic dosages of neonicotinoids can negatively influence bee learning and memory, with potential consequences for bee behaviour. As legislative reassessment of neonicotinoid use occurs globally, there is an urgent need to understand the potential risk of other systemic insecticides. Sulfoxaflor, the first branded sulfoximine-based insecticide, has the same mode of action as neonicotinoids, and may potentially replace them over large geographical ranges. Here we assessed the impact of acute sulfoxaflor exposure on performance in two paradigms that have previously been used to illustrate negative impacts of neonicotinoid pesticides on bee learning and memory. We assayed whether acute sulfoxaflor exposure influences (a) olfactory conditioning performance in both bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and honeybees (Apis mellifera), using a proboscis extension reflex assay, and (b) working memory performance of bumblebees, using a radial-arm maze. We found no evidence to suggest that sulfoxaflor influenced performance in either paradigm. Our results suggest that despite a shared mode of action between sulfoxaflor and neonicotinoidbased insecticides, widely-documented effects of neonicotinoids on bee cognition may not be observed with sulfoxaflor, at least at acute exposure regimes.

Whilst there is appreciable variation in the cognitive performance of animals, we know surprisingly little about the extent to which learning varies among individuals across different sensory modalities. Do individuals that are good at learning in one sensory modality also perform well in another (performance is correlated between modalities), or do individuals demonstrate specialisation in learning performance in one modality (trading-off performance between modalities)? We tested these hypotheses by examining the performance of 76 Bombus terrestris workers, from four colonies, in both an odour-and visual learning task. Olfactory learning was assessed using proboscis extension reflex (PER) conditioning and visual (colour) learning was examined using a well-established free-flying paradigm. Our results showed neither a correlation, nor a trade-off, in individual performance for learning tasks using different sensory modalities. However, there was considerable variation among workers within each colony in their performance in both learning tasks. This extent of interindividual variation in learning ability across sensory modalities could be adaptive for colonies dealing with changeable foraging conditions. There was also significant intercolony variation in final task performance level in the olfactory learning task, and both the strength and persistence of blue preference in the colour learning task. This is the first study to demonstrate variation in olfactory learning performance across multiple bumblebee colonies using PER conditioning, suggesting this is an effective paradigm for assessing associative olfactory learning performance both within and among colonies. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","a comparison of visual and olfactory learning performance in the","Animals use cues from a range of sensory modalities to"

Comparative approaches, covering multiple origins and intermediate evolutionary stages, are needed to determine which of these possibilities is more likely. We use molecular phylogenetics to examine multiple origins of parasitism in the bee tribe Allodapini. We identify seven origins resulting in obligate social parasitism (inquilinism), one origin of facultative social parasitism, which was followed by subsequent speciation and where both daughter species remained facultatively parasitic, and one case of frequent facultative heterospecific co-nesting that probably represents incipient social parasitism. All hostparasite lineage pairs show strong phylogenetic affinities, but only the case of facultative heterospecific nesting involves true sister species relationships.

Previous reports concerning C. megacephala eye properties did not include measurements of body size, making the relationship between the specialized eye region and body size unclear. We examined different morphological features of the eye among individuals of varying sizes. We found total eye size scaled proportionately to body size, but the number of enlarged dorsal facets increased as body size increased. This demonstrated that larger males have an eye that is morphologically different than smaller males. On the basis of external morphology, we hypothesized that since larger males have larger and a greater number of dorsally enlarged facets, and these facets are believed to allow for increased light capture, larger males would be active in lower light levels than smaller males and females of equal size. In a laboratory setting, larger males were observed to become active earlier in the morning than smaller males, although they did not remain active later in the evening. However, females followed the same pattern at similar light levels suggesting that overall body size rather than specialized male eye morphology is responsible for increased activity under low light conditions.","body size, rather than male eye allometry, explains chrysomya megacephala","Male Chrysomya megacephala (F.) blow fly compound eyes contain an"

We found lower taxonomic diversity of bees visiting flowers of trees in small rainforest fragments compared with large forest fragments and show that bee species in small fragments were subsets of species in larger fragments. Bees visiting trees in small fragments also had higher mean body sizes than those in larger fragments, suggesting that small-sized bees may be less likely to persist in small fragments. Lastly, we found reductions in the abundance of eusocial stingless bees visiting flowers in small fragments compared to large fragments.

Bumblebees consistently showed a preference for the commonest colour morph, and this behaviour was not significantly affected by changing density. In contrast, frequency-independent preferences changes significantly with density. At low densities, there was a strong bias towards the more conspicuous colour, whereas at higher densities there was no overall colour bias. Flight distances between flowers decreased significantly at high density. Bumblebees also visited flowers of similar colours sequentially, but this behaviour was not density-dependent. It is suggested that as densities increase, there is an increased probability that bumblebees detect yellow flowers, which were probably less conspicuous compared with blue flowers, and that this might be caused by changes in flight speed with flight distance. Where there is a positive relationship between pollinator visitation and the relative fitness of a floral morph, the observed behaviour would induce positive frequency-dependent selection on a plant population with two corolla colour morphs on which the bumblebees were foraging, which would result in stabilizing selection for a single corolla colour, irrespective of density.

Crabapples 'Adams' and 'Purple Lemoine', possessing a heterozygous dominant gene for red leaf color, were used as pollinizers to assess the range of pollen dispersal in apple trees. 'Fuji' trees in pots were scattered as pollen recipients 2 to 400 m apart from the 'Adams' pollinizer towards four directions in the field experiment. All fruits were harvested from the trees and seeds collected were germinated in a greenhouse after stratification. Without bees present in the screen cage, very few fruits set at a distance less than 1 m from the pollinizer. In field trials, the number of red seedlings arising from seed samples declined sharply with increasing distance from the pollinizer. The area of pollen dispersal in this experiment was wider as compared with the result of Wertheim in the Netherlands. The results of our experiments suggest that the distance to prevent unintended pollination from a pollinizer is over 150 m under Japanese environment conditions.","estimation of gene flow via pollen spread for the orchard","Several genetically modified apples (Malus xdomestica) have been produced in"

We trained ants to forage at different distances in linear channels comprising a nest entrance and a feeder. For testing we caught ants at the feeder and released them in a parallel channel. The results show that ants tend to underestimate their distances travelled. This underestimation is the more pronounced, the larger the foraging distance gets. The quantitative relationship between training distance and the ant's estimate of this distance can be described by a logarithmic and an exponential model. The ant's odometric undershooting could be adaptive during natural foraging trips insofar as it leads the homing ant to concentrate the major part of its nest-search behaviour on the base of its individual foraging sector, i.e. on its familiar landmark corridor.","the ant's estimation of distance travelled: experiments with desert ants,","Foraging desert ants, Cataglyphis fortis, monitor their position relative to"

Because of this, it has been necessary to develop a range of techniques for pharmacological manipulation of honey bees. In this paper we demonstrate methods for treating restrained or free-flying honey bees with a wide range of pharmacological agents. These include both noninvasive methods such as oral and topical treatments, as well as more invasive methods that allow for precise drug delivery in either systemic or localized fashion. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method and describe common hurdles and how to best overcome them.

The size of surveyed islands ranges between 0.75 and 41.32 ha; their distance from the coast of Java varies between 3 and 62 km.Methods Field work was conducted from February to May 2005. Bees and wasps were caught with a sweep net during sampling units of 15 min, continuing until four consecutive samples revealed no new species. Total species richness was quantified by the estimators Chao 2, first-order jackknife and Michaelis-Menten. The software binmatnest was used to test for nestedness of species assemblages. Similarities of species composition between islands were quantified by Sørensen's similarity index.Results Eighty-two species were recorded on the 20 surveyed islands. Species richness declined with increasing isolation of islands from the source area, Java. Although the size of the largest island exceeded that of the smallest island by a factor of almost 60, island size only very weakly affected species richness of bees; no effect of island size was found for wasps. Mean body size of species decreased with increasing island isolation. Nestedness of island faunas was only weakly developed. Species composition of both superfamilies was affected by island isolation, but not by island size.Main conclusions While the species-isolation relationship on the very small islands of Kepulauan Seribu followed the prediction of MacArthur and Wilson's equilibrium theory, the absence of a species-area relationship indicated a weak 'small-island effect', at least in wasps. The combination of an only weakly developed pattern of nested species subsets, the shift in species compositions and the decline of mean body size with increasing island isolation from the source area indicates that biotic interactions and different species traits contribute to the shaping of communities of bees and wasps within the archipelago. The potential of biotic interactions for generating distribution patterns of species within the archipelago is also emphasized by the observed restriction of some species with apparently high dispersal abilities to outer islands. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","how island size and isolation affect bee and wasp ensembles","Aim To study the effects of isolation and size of"

However, bee response to the disturbance of biomass harvesting may depend on their nesting location, thus their vulnerability to nest destruction, and the response of the forb community on which they forage. Moreover, because bees have long foraging ranges, effects of local harvesting may depend on the amount of natural habitat in the surrounding landscape. We performed a large-scale one- and two-year experiment in Michigan and Wisconsin, USA, respectively, to examine how grassland harvesting, landscape context, and study year affect the forb community, above- and belowground-nesting bee species richness, community composition, trap nest emergence, and visitation rate. In Wisconsin, harvesting increased forb richness, cover, and evenness compared to unharvested control sites. Harvesting negatively affected aboveground-nesting bee richness and emergence from trap nests, possibly because of nest destruction during the previous harvest. By contrast, harvesting positively affected belowground-nesting bee richness, possibly because of the greater food resource availability and reduced thatch allowing greater access to nesting sites in the soil. Harvesting also affected bee community composition, reflecting the increase in belowground-nesting species at harvested sites. Despite harvesting effects on forb and bee communities, there was no effect on flower visitation rate, indicating little effect on pollination function. We did not find a harvest by landscape context interaction, which, in combination with the negative harvesting effect on trap nest emergence, suggests that harvesting can affect local population growth rather than simply affecting forager aggregation in different resource environments. For bees, there was no harvest by study year interaction, indicating a consistent response over a short timescale. Similarly, in Michigan, belowground-nesting species also responded positively to harvesting, which was more pronounced in sandier soils that are preferred for nesting. However, other components of the Michigan bee and forb communities were not significantly affected by biomass harvesting. Overall, our study demonstrates that harvesting grasslands can positively affect the ~80% of bee species that nest belowground by enhancing nest and/or forage resources, but that conserving aboveground nesters may require leaving some area unharvested. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America","harvesting effects on wild bee communities in bioenergy grasslands depend","Conversion of annual crops to native perennial grasslands for bioenergy"

But it has not been clear if observed benefits of floral enhancements result from greater population growth, which is critical for the long-term success of conservation, or from mobile foragers aggregating in high-resource locations. Experimental evidence is only beginning to emerge in favor of the former mechanism and it is not well-established how different aspects of floral resources affect population growth. For example, bumble bee colonies may benefit from greater overall floral abundance, richness, or relative dominance of resource species. Because bumble bees are highly mobile, resource variability in the surrounding landscape is also important for colonies and may mediate local-scale effects. We experimentally assessed the growth and reproduction of bumble bee colonies (Bombus impatiens) deployed in grasslands in different local- and landscape-scale resource environments. We found that floral dominance, rather than the overall abundance or richness of floral resources, was the most important local factor for colony growth and reproduction. This may reflect more efficient foraging on a few numerically dominant and abundant resource species. Local- and landscape-scale predictor variables had interacting effects on colony growth and reproduction, suggesting that foraging distance depends on where in the landscape efficiently used resources are located. Our results provide further evidence that conservation strategies aimed at enhancing floral resources can increase bumble bee population growth.

All adult individuals found in the populations were mapped and sampled and open-pollinated seeds were collected from two populations. The genotypic diversity (> 0.85) indicates that sexual reproduction is predominant and the short distance between ramets indicates that asexual reproduction occurs by root development. In general, populations present SGS which is explained, in part, by root development. The genetic differentiation among populations was greater between more distant populations, suggesting a gene dispersal pattern of isolation by distance. Pollen flow (> 27%) indicates that populations are not reproductively isolated, but fertilization followed an isolation by distance pattern. The outcrossing rate was high ( > 0.8), but some mating occurred among related individuals ( > 0.1) and were correlated ( > 0.15), indicating inbreeding and varying levels of relatedness within families. Inbreeding was higher in seed cohorts than adults, suggesting selection against inbred individuals between seed and adult stages.

Thus the term ‘forager’ encompasses multiple distinct behaviors that rely on different sensory modalities. Despite a robust literature on bumblebee foraging behavior, few studies are directly relevant to sensory-guided search; i.e. how workers locate novel patches. The first step in answering this question is to determine what sensory information is available to searching bumblebees. This manuscript presents a computational model that elucidates the relative frequency of visual and olfactory cues that are available to workers searching for floral resources under a range of ecologically relevant scenarios. Model results indicate that odor is the most common sensory cue encountered during search flights. When the likelihood of odor-plume contact is higher, odor-encounter is ubiquitous. While integrative (visual + olfactory) cues are common when foragers are searching for larger flowers (e.g. Echinacea), they become rare when foragers are searching for small flowers (e.g. Penstemon). Visual cues are only encountered in isolation when foragers are seeking large flowers with a low odor-plume contact probability. These results indicate that despite the multisensory nature of floral signals, different modalities may be encountered in isolation during search-behavior, as opposed to the reliably multimodal signals encountered during patch-exploitation or nectar/ pollen acquisition. © 2018, The Author(s).","the prevalence of olfactory- versus visual-signal encounter by searching bumblebees","While the phrase ‘foraging bumblebee’ brings to mind a bumbling"

To investigate the basis of this “centering response, ” bees were trained to fly through a tunnel on their way to a feeding site and back, while their flight trajectories were filmed from above. The wall on either side carried a visual pattern. When the patterns were stationary vertical gratings, bees tended to fly through the middle of the tunnel, i.e. along its longitudinal axis. However, when one of the gratings was in motion, bees flying in the same direction as the moving grating tended to fly closer to it, while bees flying in the opposite direction tended to fly closer to the stationary grating. This demonstrates, directly and unequivocally, that flying bees estimate the distances of surfaces in terms of the apparent motion of their images. A series of further experiments revealed that the distance to the gratings is gauged in terms of their apparent angular speeds, and that the visual system of the bee is capable of measuring angular speed largely independently of the spatial period, intensity profile, or contrast of the grating. Thus, the motion-sensitive mechanisms mediating range perception appear to be qualitatively different from those that mediate the well-known optomotor response in insects, or those involved in motion detection and ocular tracking in man. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

Several studies have examined the impact of forest proximity on plant pollination ecology, but concentrated on single crop species. However, it can be more informative to investigate multiple crop and pollinator species in a community, because different pollinator groups may respond differently to forest distance. We evaluated flower visitor diversity, visitation frequency, and fruit set for three crop species (rambutan, durian and mango) in 10 pairs of mixed fruit orchards. Each pair consisted of one orchard near to (< 1 km) and one orchard far from (> 7 km) the forest edge. Rambutan fruit set was significantly influenced by distance to forest. The main visitors of rambutan flowers were stingless bees. In contrast, the dominant visitors to durian and mango flowers were nectarivorous bats and flies, respectively, and the fruit set of these crops were not significantly influenced by distance to forest. However, durian fruit set was negatively affected by distance to the nearest cave inhabited by nectarivorous bats. This study demonstrates that both caves and forests can be important pollinator sources for agricultural crops, and that the dispersal success of pollinators is related to isolation from source habitats.

For biologically relevant altitudes, wind speed increases exponentially with increased height above the ground. Thus, dispersal of most insects is influenced by atmospheric conditions. However, insects that fly close to the Earth's surface displace within the flight boundary layer where insect airspeeds are relatively high. Over the past 17 years, we have studied boundary-layer insects by following individuals as they migrate across the Caribbean Sea and the Panama Canal. Although most migrants evade either drought or cold, nymphalid and pierid butterflies migrate across Panama near the onset of the rainy season. Dragonflies of the genus Pantala migrate in October concurrently with frontal weather systems. Migrating the furthest and thereby being the most difficult to study, the diurnal moth Urania fulgens migrates between Central and South America. Migratory butterflies and dragonflies are capable of directed movement towards a preferred compass direction in variable winds, whereas the moths drift with winds over water. Butterflies orient using both global and local cues. Consistent with optimal migration theory, butterflies and dragonflies adjust their flight speeds in ways that maximize migratory distance traveled per unit fuel, whereas the moths do not. Moreover, only butterflies adjust their flight speed in relation to endogenous fat reserves. It is likely that these insects use optic flow to gauge their speed and drift, and thus must migrate where sufficient detail in the Earth's surface is visible to them. The abilities of butterflies and dragonflies to adjust their airspeed over water indicate sophisticated control and guidance systems pertaining to migration.","optimal strategies for insects migrating in the flight boundary layer:","Directed aerial displacement requires that a volant organism's airspeed exceeds"

Thorax temperature during dancing was quite variable (31.4-43°C). In the course of a foraging season it varied considerably and was always lower than in bees foraging from a highly profitable food source (2 molar sucrose 120 m from the hive). It averaged 38.0°C (SD=2.24, n=224 dances) in the nectar foragers and 37.4°C (SD=1.64, n=171) in the pollen foragers, resembling that of dancers foraging 0.5 molar sucrose from feeders with unlimited flow. Hive air temperature accounted only for about 3-8% of total variation. Foraging distance modulated dancing temperature in a way that, according to the decrease of the profitability of foraging with distance, maximum temperatures decreased and, in accordance with the increase of the dancing threshold with distance, minimum temperatures increased with distance, this way providing new support for the hypothesis that the dancing temperature is modulated by the profitability of foraging and the dancing and foraging motivation of the bees. Dancing temperature of both nectar and pollen dancers correlated with several parameters of the hive status, increasing with the amount of brood and decreasing with the amount of honey and pollen. These correlations are discussed with respect to literature reports on a colony's need for pollen and nectar, in particular the effect of brood and the amount of pollen on pollen foraging, and the effect of honey stores and demand for nectar on nectar foraging. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","thermoregulation of dancing bees: thoracic temperature of pollen and nectar","The thorax surface temperature of dancing honeybees (Apis mellifera carnica)"

Thoracic temperature while dancing and walking and during trophallactic contact with hive bees decreased with increasing flight distance. In bees foraging 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 molar sucrose solutions from a distance of 120 m, dancing temperature amounted to 38.4, 40.1, 40.9 and 40.6°C, respectively; while in bees foraging from a distance of 2950 m it amounted to 36.6, 38.4, 38.6 and 39.1 °C, respectively.

Both at short and at long flight distances, the relationship between thoracic temperature and sucrose concentration of the food followed a non-linear curve, which flattened at concentrations higher than 1 mol/l. The experiments showed that inside the hive the foragers' level of thermoregulation depends not only on the energy (sugar) content of the food; but rather, the level of thermoregulation corresponds to the general quality of the food source, which includes both energy content and distance from the hive. Because the thermal behaviour of foragers correlates with several behavioural parameters indicating the bees' foraging tendency and their eagerness to dance, thoracic temperature seems to be a correlate of the profitability of foraging.","effect of foraging distance on the thermal behaviour of honeybees","By means of infrared thermography and without disturbing social interactions,"

Oxygen consumption of active bees varied widely depending on ambient temperature and level of activity, but did not differ between foragers (&gt;18 d) and middle-aged hive bees (7-10 d). In highly active bees, which were in an endothermic state ready for flight, it decreased almost linearly, from a maximum of 131.4 μl O2 min-1 at 15°C ambient temperature to 81.1 μl min-1 at 25°C, and reached a minimum of 29.9 μl min-1 at 40°C. In bees with low activity, it decreased from 89.3 μl O2 min-1 at 15°C to 47.9 μl min-1 at 25°C and 14.7 μl min-1 at 40°C. Thermographic measurements of body temperature showed that with increasing activity, the bees invested more energy to regulate the thorax temperature at increasingly higher levels (38.8-41.2°C in highly active bees) and were more accurate. Resting metabolism was determined in young bees of 1-7 h age, which are not yet capable of endothermic heat production with their flight muscles. Their energy turnover increased from 0.21 μl O2 min -1 at 10°C to 0.38 μl min-1 at 15°C, 1.12 μl min-1 at 25°C, and 3.03 μl min-1 at 40°C. At 15, 25 and 40°C, this was 343, 73 and 10 times below the values of the highly active bees, respectively. The Q10 value of the resting bees, however, was not constant but varied in a U-shaped manner with ambient temperature. It decreased from 4.24 in the temperature range 11-21°C to 1. 35 in the range 21-31°C, and increased again to 2.49 in the range 30-40°C.

The quantity of individual essential amino acids (EAAs) obtained from dietary protein depends on the protein source, but how the proportion of EAAs in the diet affects nutrient balancing has rarely been studied. Recent research using the Geometric Framework for Nutrition has revealed that forager honeybees who receive much of their dietary EAAs from floral nectar and not from solid protein have relatively low requirements for dietary EAAs. Here, we examined the nutritional requirements for protein and carbohydrates of foragers of the bufftailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris. By using protein (sodium caseinate) or an equimolar mixture of the 10 EAAs, we found that the intake target (nutritional optimum) of adult workers depended on the source and proportion of dietary EAAs. When bees consumed caseinate-containing diets in a range of ratios between 1:250 and 1:25 (protein to carbohydrate), they achieved an intake target (IT) of 1:149 (w/w). In contrast to those fed protein, bees fed the EAA diets had an IT more biased towards carbohydrates (1:560 w/w) but also had a greater risk of death than those fed caseinate. We also tested how the dietary source of EAAs affected free AAs in bee haemolymph. Bees fed diets near their IT had similar haemolymph AA profiles, whereas bees fed diets high in caseinate had elevated levels of leucine, threonine, valine and alanine in the haemolymph. We found that like honeybees, bumblebee workers prioritize carbohydrate intake and have a relatively low requirement for protein. The dietary source of EAAs influenced both the ratio of protein/EAA to carbohydrate and the overall amount of carbohydrate eaten. Our data support the idea that EAAs and carbohydrates in haemolymph are important determinants of nutritional state in insects. © 2015.

Mating patterns were estimated for each maternal tree within 84-ha populations of C. longifolium and S. mombin in 1992 and 1993 and within a 50-ha population of T. occidentalis in 1993. Each population was 100% outcrossed. Multilocus paternity exclusion analyses indicated that in C. longifolium, a minimum of 62% of effective pollen moved at least 210 m. For S. mombin, estimates of apparent pollen flow greater than 300 m were 5.2% and 2.5% in 1992 and 1993, respectively. For all species, pollen dispersal was strongly affected by the spatial distribution of reproductive trees. Where flowering adults were evenly spaced, a large fraction of effective pollen moved at least a few hundred meters and well beyond the nearest reproductive neighbors. Conversely, where flowering trees were clumped, the majority of matings were among near neighbors.

These cryptic species have, until now, largely been grouped together in ecological studies, and so little is known about their individual colony densities, foraging ranges or habitat requirements, which can be influenced by land use at a landscape scale. We used mass-flowering oilseed rape fields as locations to sample bees of this complex, as well as the second most common visitor to oilseed rape B. lapidarius, and molecular RFLP methods to distinguish between the cryptic species. We then used microsatellite genotyping to identify sisters and estimate colony densities, and related both proportions of cryptic species and their colony densities to the composition of the landscape surrounding the fields. We found B. lucorum was the most common member of the complex present in oilseed rape followed by B. terrestris. B. cryptarum was also present in all but one site, with higher proportions found in the east of the study area. High numbers of bumblebee colonies were estimated to be using oilseed rape fields as a forage resource, with B. terrestris colony numbers higher than previous estimates from non-mass-flowering fields. We also found that the cryptic species responded differently to surrounding landscape composition: both relative proportions of B. cryptarum in samples and colony densities of B. lucorum were negatively associated with the amount of arable land in the landscape, while proportions and colony densities of other species did not respond to landscape variables at the scale measured. This suggests that the cryptic species have different ecological requirements (which may be scale-dependent) and that oilseed rape can be an important forage resource for many colonies of bumblebees. Given this, we recommend sustainable management of this crop to benefit bumblebees. © 2013 Stanley et al.","ecological variation in response to mass-flowering oilseed rape and surrounding","The Bombus sensu stricto species complex is a widespread group"

Pesticide exposure may cause behavioural changes that interfere with these processes, with consequences for colony persistence and delivery of pollination services. We investigated the impact of chronic exposure (5–43 days) to field-realistic levels of a neonicotinoid insecticide (2·4 ppb thiamethoxam) on foraging ability, homing success and colony size using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in free-flying bumblebee colonies. Individual foragers from pesticide-exposed colonies carried out longer foraging bouts than untreated controls (68 vs. 55 min). Pesticide-exposed bees also brought back pollen less frequently than controls indicating reduced foraging performance. A higher proportion of bees from pesticide-exposed colonies returned when released 1 km from their nests; this is potentially related to increased orientation experience during longer foraging bouts. We measured no impact of pesticide exposure on homing ability for bees released from 2 km, or when data were analysed overall. Despite a trend for control colonies to produce more new workers earlier, we found no overall impacts of pesticide exposure on whole colony size. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that field-realistic neonicotinoid exposure can have impacts on both foraging ability and homing success of bumblebees, with implications for the success of bumblebee colonies in agricultural landscapes and their ability to deliver crucial pollination services.

Increased production of novel crops for bioenergy is causing changes in agricultural practice, but the effects on different pollinating taxa have not yet been quantified. However, the major pollinating groups (social bees, solitary bees, hoverflies and butterflies) are likely to respond differently to changes in land use and shifts in crop cultivation patterns. We assessed the impacts of two bioenergy crops, oilseed rape Brassica napus L. and Miscanthus Miscanthus X giganteus on (i) the diversity and abundance of four taxonomic groups of pollinating insects, (ii) insect community composition, (iii) floral resources and (iv) nesting sites for bumblebees, by comparing bioenergy crops with conventional arable and grass crops in a large network of commercial fields. We found that although there were more bumblebees in oilseed rape fields, conventional crops and bioenergy crops did not differ greatly in species richness of most pollinator groups, although more floral resources were found in the bioenergy crops. However, solitary bees were more abundant and species rich in energy crops than conventional wheat, and more trap-nesting bees and wasps were found in Miscanthus than oilseed rape. In addition, novel assemblages of solitary bees were found in the bioenergy crops. All pollinator groups, and flowering plants, were more abundant in field margins than in the centre of crop fields. Although there were no differences among crop types, nest-searching bumblebees were confined to field margins. This highlights the importance of field margins as forage and nesting habitat for pollinators in farmland. Synthesis and applications. Differential responses to field-scale growth of bioenergy crops were displayed by the taxonomic groups studied, suggesting that effects on biodiversity cannot be generalized from studies based on a small suite of taxonomic groups and must include a range of taxa for overarching results. To optimize habitat for pollinators in agricultural areas, our data suggest that a diversity of crop types at small scales may have positive impacts and supports appropriate management and conservation of field margins and hedgerows during conversion to bioenergy production.

We studied a host-antagonist system of cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their antagonists and hypothesised that hosts and antagonists show different responses to local land-use intensity, the diversity of landscape in terms of composition and the spatial structure of landscape in terms of configuration. In a highly replicated study, we established nesting resources on 95 grasslands in three geographic regions across Germany and measured species richness and abundance of hosts (bees and wasps) and their antagonists, and rates of parasitism. For each site, we quantified local land-use intensity as well as landscape heterogeneity in terms of composition and configuration at spatial scales ranging from 250 m to 2000 m. Increasing landscape heterogeneity enhanced species richness, abundance and parasitism rate, whereas local land-use intensity only marginally negatively affected total abundance. Bee and wasp abundance as well as wasp species richness were enhanced by landscape composition at 250 m, whereas their antagonists were enhanced by landscape configuration at 1500 m. In conclusion, landscape composition and configuration affect trophic levels differently and are more relevant than local land-use intensity. Solitary bees and wasps, which offer important pollination and pest control services, could be supported by enhancing landscape diversity, while their antagonists could benefit from measures that promote landscape connectivity. Hence, scale-dependent and trophic group specific conservation management schemes are required, that address different components of landscape heterogeneity to enhance functional diversity and trophic interactions in agricultural landscapes.

Thelytokous workers are believed to be unique to Apis mellifera capensis, so that the problem is to find morphological markers distinguishing this race from its A. m. scutellata neighbours. However, no evidence of the expected hybrid zone demarcating races could be found. Factor analysis revealed only one spherical cluster of samples. Trend surfaces of the local mean morphometric factor scores showed a cline that paralleled latitude, with distortions relating to montane and continental effects. Discriminant function analysis implicated certain mountain ranges in amplifying the effects of latitude. Trend surfaces of local intercolony factor variance showed morphometric homogeneity across most of the country. We conclude that there is only a single population of honey bees in South Africa, and that it shows climate-correlated clinal variation. If the transportation of bees for commercial apiculture is to be successfully regulated to solve the 'capensis calamity', further research should focus on the geographical distribution of thelytokous workers rather than on the capensis phenotype. Such workers have a wider distribution than capensis, occurring also at high frequencies around the type locality of A. m. scutellata. © 1998 Blackwell Science Ltd.","clinal morphometric variation in wild honey bees (hymenoptera: apidae) in","As a result of side effects of the accidental dispersal"

In this paper, I outline a time-efficient procedure to collect data on flower-visiting animals. The objectives were, first, to model diel activity rhythms by using cosine-based mixed-effects regression models (cosinor method) on data from an established automatic video monitoring system and, secondly, to test the use of a cheap off-the-shelf digital camera modified for automated monitoring of flower visitors. Two different model systems were studied: foraging bumblebees visiting focal white clovers, monitored around-the-clock (193 h) to model diel activity; and honeybees visiting thistles, monitored over a shorter period (5 h) to test the applicability and reliability of a new method for monitoring pollinators. The data were automatically entered and processed using R-scripts after manual filtering of the images, obviating the need for manual data entry prior to analysis. For diel activity in bumblebees, the model that gave the best fit included the 24-h fundamental period and one harmonic, a 12-h period to modulate the signal, together with temperature. The bumblebees were exclusive diurnal, with activity starting about 5 h after sunrise, peaking sharply in the afternoon and ending about 1 h before sunset. In addition to time of day, activity also increased with temperature. The off-the-shelf digital camera, Canon PowerShot®, with motion detection script, was triggered by every flower-visiting honeybee. In addition to recorded visitor frequency and visitor duration, it enabled high-resolution images, which could be important for species identification. Automatic camera recording is advantageous for close-up monitoring, compared with continuous video recording, because the latter demands more time and effort in reviewing the material. It could be used to study a range of different species such as pollinators, on-plant behaviour of herbivorous animals, cavity dwellers or cavity breeders. Moreover, the procedures for automatic data entry, data processing and statistical analysis for modelling diel activity rhythms could have great relevance for researchers using other types of camera monitoring systems operating 24 h per day. © 2016 The Author.

The grasslands greatly differed in the number of honey bee colonies within a radius of 2 km and were surrounded by agricultural habitats. The number of flower-visiting honey bees on both potted mustard plants and small grassland patches declined with increasing distance from the nearest apiary and was almost zero at a distance of 1.5-2.0 km. Wild bees were observed visiting 57 plant species, whereas honey bees visited only 24 plant species. Percentage resource overlap between honey bees and wild bees was 45.5%, and Hurlbert's index of niche overlap was 3.1. In total, 1849 wild bees from 98 species were recorded on the calcareous grasslands. Neither species richness nor abundance of wild bees were negatively correlated with the density of honey bee colonies (within a radius of 2 km) or the density of flower-visiting honey bees per site.

Loss of populations may negatively affect biotic interactions and ecosystem stability. Here we tested the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation affects bee populations and thereby disrupts plant-pollinator interactions. We experimentally established small 'habitat islands' of two self-incompatible, annual crucifers on eight calcareous grasslands and in the intensively managed agricultural landscape at increasing distances (up to 1000 m) from these species-rich grasslands to measure effects of isolation on both pollinator guilds and seed set, independently from patch size and density, resource availability and genetic erosion of plant populations. Each habitat island consisted of four pots each with one plant of mustard (Sinapis arvensis) and radish (Raphanus sativus). Increasing isolation of the small habitat islands resulted in both decreased abundance and species richness of flower-visiting bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea). Mean body size of flower-visiting wild bees was larger on isolated than on nonisolated habitat islands emphasizing the positive correlation of body size and foraging distance. Abundance of flower-visiting honeybees depended on the distance from the nearest apiary. Abundance of other flower visitors such as hover flies did not change with increasing isolation. Number of seeds per fruit and per plant decreased significantly with increasing distance from the nearest grassland for both mustard and radish. Mean seed set per plant was halved at a distance of approximately 1000 m for mustard and at 250 m for radish. In accordance with expectations, seed set per plant was positively correlated with the number of flower-visiting bees. We found no evidence for resource limitation in the case of mustard and only marginal effects for radish. We conclude that habitat connectivity is essential to maintain not only abundant and diverse bee communities, but also plant-pollinator interactions in economically important crops and endangered wild plants.","effects of habitat isolation on pollinator communities and seed set","Destruction and fragmentation of natural habitats is the major reason"

We studied spatial and temporal population dynamics of the solitary bee Osmia rufa (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) in 30 fragmented orchard meadows ranging in size from 0.08 to 5.8 ha in an agricultural landscape in central Germany. From 1998 to 2003, we monitored local bee population size, rate of parasitism, and rate of larval and pupal mortality in reed trap nests as an accessible and standardized nesting resource. Experimentally enhanced nest site availability resulted in a steady increase of mean local population size from 80 to 2740 brood cells between 1998 and 2002. Population size and species richness of natural enemies increased with habitat area, whereas rate of parasitism and mortality only varied among years. Inverse density-dependent parasitism in three study years with highest population size suggests rather destabilizing instead of regulating effects of top-down forces. Accordingly, an analysis of independent time series showed on average a negative impact of population size on population growth rates but provides no support for top-down regulation by natural enemies.

We tested the foraging rhythms of bumblebee (Bombus terrestris and B. pascuorum) colonies in northern Finland during the summer, when the sun stays above the horizon for weeks. We used fully automatic radio-frequency identification to monitor the foraging activity of more than 1,000 workers and analysed their circadian foraging rhythms.Results: Foragers did not use the available 24-h foraging period but exhibited robust diurnal rhythms instead. A mean of 95.2% of the tested B. terrestris workers showed robust diurnal rhythms with a mean period of 23.8 h. Foraging activity took place mainly between 08:00 and 23:00, with only low or almost no activity during the rest of the day. Activity levels increased steadily during the morning, reached a maximum around midday and decreased again during late afternoon and early evening. Foraging patterns of native B. pascuorum followed the same temporal organisation, with the foraging activity being restricted to the period between 06:00 and 22:00.Conclusions: The results of the present study indicate that the circadian clock of the foragers must have been entrained by some external cue, the most prominent being daily cycles in light intensity and temperature. Daily fluctuations in the spectral composition of light, especially in the UV range, could also be responsible for synchronising the circadian clock of the foragers under continuous daylight conditions. © 2010 Stelzer and Chittka; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","bumblebee foraging rhythms under the midnight sun measured with radiofrequency","Background: In the permanent daylight conditions north of the Arctic"

First, I argue that experimental preparations based on binary, mutually exclusive choice are not good models of foraging decisions. Instead, foraging choices have a sequential foreground-background structure, in which one option is in the background of all other options. Second, behavioral ecologists view foraging as a hierarchy of decisions that range from habitat selection to food choice.

Territorial males patrolled an area adjacent to a tree upon which they perched. Territorial males utilized the same territory for up to 49 days, though often not on consecutive days, and appeared to non-violently relinquish territories to new males. Transients did not defend territories but flew from one territory to another and flew with the territorial male around the territory, rarely bumping, and never grappling. Transient males left the territory soon after the territorial male flew back and forth in front of the perch tree in a zig-zag flight. The alternative behaviors were correlated with wing wear such that males with little wing wear defended territories and males with considerable wing wear pursued a transient strategy. Behavior patterns were not correlated with head width. Comparison of territory trees with the territory trees of a closely related species indicate that each species utilized trees of a certain diameter class for perching. In addition, analysis of hemispherical canopy photographs indicates that males appeared to prefer territories that received a maximum of diffuse sunlight but a minimum of direct sunlight. Both territorial and transient males consistently returned to specific territories over their lifetime but appeared to travel long distances to forage for fragrances.

However, whether the use of parallax information is confined to specialised behaviours like these or represents a more general purpose sensory capability, is an open question.We investigate this issue in the foraging swallowtail butterfly Papilio xuthus, which we trained to associate a target presented on a monitor with a food reward.We then tracked the animal's flight in realtime, allowing us to manipulate the size and/or position of the target in a closed-loop manner to create the illusion that it is situated either above or below the monitor surface. Butterflies are less attracted to (i.e. slower to approach) targets that appear, based on motion parallax, to be more distant. Furthermore, we found that the number of abortive descent manoeuvres performed prior to the first successful target approach varies according to the depth of the virtual target, with expansion and parallax cues having effects of opposing polarity. However, we found no evidence that Papilio modulate the kinematic parameters of their descents according to the apparent distance of the target. Thus, we argue that motion parallax is used to identify a proximal target object, but that the subsequent process of approaching it is based on stabilising its edge in the 2D space of the retina, without estimating its distance. © 2015 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.","the roles of visual parallax and edge attraction in the","Several examples of insects using visual motion to measure distance"

The current rapid growth of urban areas and concern over global pollinator declines have spurred numerous studies examining pollinator communities in temperate cities, but knowledge about tropical urban pollinators remains scarce. Methods: This study investigated the effects of habitat and landscape factors on pollinator richness and abundance in a highly-populated, tropical city: Bangkok, Thailand. We conducted pollinator observations in 52 green areas throughout the city and collected data on patch size, floral abundance, plant richness, location type, and percent vegetation at five spatial scales. Results: Of the 18,793 pollinators observed, over 98% were bees. Both patch size and floral abundance generally had positive effects on pollinators, although there was a significant interaction between the two factors; these findings were generally consistent across all focal taxa (Tetragonula stingless bees, Apis honey bees, Xylocopa carpenter bees, and butterflies). Discussion: Our results demonstrate the importance of maintaining large green areas in cities, since small green areas supported few pollinators, even when floral resources were abundant. Moreover, most pollinator taxa utilized a variety of location types (e.g., public parks, school campuses, temple grounds), with the exception of butterflies, which preferred parks. Our findings are generally consistent with those of temperate urban studies, but additional studies in the tropics are needed before global patterns can be assessed.","habitat and landscape factors influence pollinators in a tropical megacity,","Background: Pollinators are well known for the ecosystem services they"

In total, 560 samples were analyzed for concentrations of clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and their metabolites. These induded pollen from corn and cotton, nectar from cotton, flowers from soybean, honey bees, Apis mellifera L., and pollen carried by foragers returning to hives, preplanting and in-season soil samples, and wild flowers adjacent to recently planted fields. Neonicotinoid insecticides were detected at a level of 1 ng/g or above in 23% of wild flower samples around recently planted fields, with an average detection level of about 10 ng/g. We detected neonicotinoid insecticides in the soil of production fields prior to planting at an average concentration of about 10 ng/g, and over 80% of the samples having some insecticide present. Only 5% of foraging honey bees tested positive for the presence of neonicotinoid insecticides, and there was only one trace detection (< 1 ng/g) in pollen being carried by those bees. Soybean flowers, cotton pollen, and cotton nectar contained little or no neonicotinoids resulting from insecticide seed treatments. Average levels of neonicotinoid insecticides in corn pollen ranged from less than 1 to 6 ng/g. The highest neonicotinoid concentrations were found in soil collected during early flowering from insecticide seed treatment trials. However, these levels were generally not well correlated with neonicotinoid concentrations in flowers, pollen, or nectar. Concentrations in flowering structures were well below defined levels of concern thought to cause acute mortality in honey bees. The potential implications of our findings are discussed.","potential exposure of pollinators to neonicotinoid insecticides from the use","Research was done during 2012 to evaluate the potential exposure"

Potential ecological consequences of invasion of non-native pollinators include increased pollination and seed set of invasive plants, with subsequent impacts on population growth rates and rates of spread. We outline a quantitative approach for evaluating the impact of a proposed introduction of an invasive pollinator on existing weed population dynamics and demonstrate the use of this approach on a relatively data-rich case study: the impacts on Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) from proposed introduction of Bombus terrestris. Three models have been used to assess population growth (matrix model), spread speed (integrodifference equation), and equilibrium occupancy (lattice model) for C. scoparius. We use available demographic data for an Australian population to parameterize two of these models. Increased seed set due to more efficient pollination resulted in a higher population growth rate in the density-independent matrix model, whereas simulations of enhanced pollination scenarios had a negligible effect on equilibrium weed occupancy in the lattice model. This is attributed to strong microsite limitation of recruitment in invasive C. scoparius populations observed in Australia and incorporated in the lattice model. A lack of information regarding secondary ant dispersal of C. scoparius prevents us from parameterizing the integrodifference equation model for Australia, but studies of invasive populations in California suggest that spread speed will also increase with higher seed set. For microsite-limited C. scoparius populations, increased seed set has minimal effects on equilibrium site occupancy. However, for density-independent rapidly invading populations, increased seed set is likely to lead to higher growth rates and spread speeds. The impacts of introduced pollinators on native flora and fauna and the potential for promoting range expansion in pollinator-limited 'sleeper weeds' also remain substantial risks. © 2006 The Authors.","a modelling approach to estimate the effect of exotic pollinators","The role of mutualisms in contributing to species invasions is"

Typically, these surveys have found frequent contamination of pollen with multiple pesticides, with most of the estimated risk of acute oral toxicity to honey bees coming from insecticides. In our survey of pesticides in trapped pollen from three commercial ornamental plant nurseries in Connecticut, we found most samples within the range of acute toxicity in a previous state pollen survey, but a few samples at one nursery with unusually high acute oral toxicity. Using visual sorting by color of the pollen pellets collected in two samples from this nursery, followed by pesticide analysis of the sorted pollen and palynology to identify the plant sources of the pollen with the greatest acute toxicity of pesticide residues, we were able to associate pollen from the plant genus Spiraea L.

This study is the first to trace highly toxic pollen collected by honey bees to a single plant genus.

Here, we investigate how an entire assemblage of orchid bees responded to the effects of forest habitat loss, isolation and forest canopy degradation induced by a hydroelectric reservoir of Central Brazilian Amazonia. Built in 1986, the Balbina Dam resulted in a vast archipelagic landscape containing 3546 primary forest islands of varying sizes and isolation, surrounded by 3129 km2 of freshwater. Using scent traps, we sampled 34 islands, 14 open-water matrix sites, and three mainland continuous forests, yielding 2870 male orchid bees representing 25 species. Local orchid bee species richness was affected by forest patch area but particularly by site isolation. Distance to forest edges, either within forest areas or into the open-water matrix, was the most important predictor of species richness and composition. Variation in matrix dispersal of individual species to increasingly isolated sites was a key determinant of community structure.

Rhododendron ponticum is very successful, ecologically damaging invasive plant in Britain and Ireland, but is in decline in its native Iberian habitat. It spreads locally by sending out lateral branches, but for longer distance dispersal it relies on sexually produced seeds. Little is known about R. ponticum's pollination ecology and breeding biology in invaded habitats. We examined the flower-visiting communities and maternal reproductive success of R. ponticum in native populations in southern Spain and in exotic ones in Ireland. R. ponticum in flowers are visited by various generalist (polylectic) pollinator species in both native and exotic habitats. Although different species visited flowers in Ireland and Spain, the flower visitation rate was not significantly different. Insects foraging on R. ponticum in Spain carried less R. ponticum pollen than their Irish counterparts, and carried fewer pollen types. Fruit production per inflorescence varied greatly within all populations but was significantly correlated with visitation at the population level. Nectar was significantly depleted by insects in some exotic populations, suggesting that this invasive species is providing a floral resource for native insects in some parts of Ireland.

We provide information on the local distribution, seasonal abundance and sex ratio of A. manicatum from samples collected in an intensive two-year survey across Utah, USA. Anthidium manicatum was detected in 10 of the 29 Utah counties, largely in urban and suburban settings. Combining presence-only and MaxEnt background data from literature, museum databases and new records from Utah, we constructed three species distribution models to examine the potential distribution of A. manicatum in its native Eurasian range as well as invaded ranges of North and South America. The A. manicatum model based on locality and background data from the species' native range predicted 50% of the invasive records associated with high habitat suitability (HS ≥ 0.90). The invasive North American model predicted a much broader distribution of A. manicatum (214% increase); whereas, the South American model predicted a narrower distribution (88% decrease). The poor predictive power of the latter model in estimating suitable habitats in the invasive South American range of A. manicatum suggests that the bee may still be limited by the bioclimatic constraints associated with a novel environment. Estimates of niche similarity (D) between the native and invasive models find that the North America bioclimatic niche is more similar to the bioclimatic niche of the native model (D=0.78), whereas the bioclimatic niche of the South America invasion is relatively dissimilar (D=0.69).

Limitations are expected both on acuity, and thus on the ability to detect objects from a distance, as well as on sensitivity, and thus on the foraging time window at dusk and dawn. In this study, we determined light intensity thresholds for flight under dim light conditions in eight stingless bee species in relation to body size in a Neotropical lowland rainforest.

Brood parasites enter the nests of other species and divert host resources for producing their own offspring, which can lead to strong antagonistic parasite–host coevolution. Here, we look at commonalities among social insect species that are victims of brood parasites, and use phylogenetic data and information on geographical range size to predict which species are most probably to fall victims to brood parasites in the future. In our analyses, we focus on three eusocial hymenopteran groups and their brood parasites: (i) bumblebees, (ii) Myrmica ants, and (iii) vespine and polistine wasps. In these groups, some, but not all, species are parasitized by obligate workerless inquilines that only produce reproductive-caste descendants. We find phylogenetic signals for geographical range size and the presence of parasites in bumblebees, but not in ants and wasps. Phylogenetic logistic regressions indicate that the probability of being attacked by one or more brood parasite species increases with the size of the geographical range in bumblebees, but the effect is statistically only marginally significant in ants. However, non-phylogenetic logistic regressions suggest that bumblebee species with the largest geographical range sizes may have a lower likelihood of harbouring social parasites than do hosts with medium-sized ranges. Our results provide new insights into the ecology and evolution of host–social parasite systems, and indicate that host phylogeny and geographical range size can be used to predict threats posed by social parasites, as well to design efficient conservation measures for both hosts and their parasites.

The results indicated a physical impairment: allatectomized bees had a significantly slower ground speed than sham and untreated bees during orientation flights, but otherwise attributes such as flight range and area were normal. Flight impairment was confirmed in Experiment 2, based on observations of takeoff made in the field at the hive entrance. The allatectomized group had a significantly smaller percentage of flightworthy bees than did the sham and untreated groups. Experiment 3 confirmed the flight impairment in laboratory tests and showed that allatectomy causes a decrease in metabolic rate. Allatectomized bees had significantly lower metabolic rates than untreated and sham bees, while allatectomized bees receiving hormone replacement had intermediate values. These results indicate that allatectomy causes flight impairment, probably partly due to effects on metabolic rate. They also suggest that juvenile hormone plays an additional, previously unknown, role in coordinating the physiological underpinning of division of labor in honey bee colonies.","juvenile hormone and division of labor in honey bee colonies:","Three experiments were performed to determine why removal of the"

Statistical analyses showed that the level of flight was correlated with the temperature and light intensity in both species. Both species could fly under dry and moderately wet conditions. We conducted a principle components analysis (PCA) to tease apart the effects of different environmental variables. The first PCA factor for L. hoozana was temperature limits on flights and foraging. For A. cerana, the PCA revealed that light intensity was the most important limiting factor. In most cases, A. cerana foragers had more departure flights per unit time and spent more time flying than foragers of L. hoozana. The minimum flight temperatures for L. hoozana ranged from 11 degrees C to 16 degrees C, and were higher than the minimum flight temperatures of 8 degrees C to 10 degrees C for A. cerana. Thus, A. cerana colonies exhibited greater flight activity during cooler times of the year than L. hoozana.

Persistence in fragmented landscapes depends on the maintenance of connectivity among populations, without which genetic diversity may decrease and lead to population declines. Bees are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of low genetic diversity so it is important to understand patterns of dispersal for native bees living in fragmented areas. I used population genetic techniques to characterize patterns of genetic diversity and dispersal for the orchid bee Euglossa imperialis within and among forest fragments in southern Costa Rica, in which the furthest two fragments were 226 km from one another. In addition, I compared results of population genetic analyses conducted with all bees sampled, and results from analyses conducted with a reduced dataset containing only one individual per full sibling family from each site. For both datasets genetic diversity was low within forest fragments, with expected heterozygosity averaging 0.28 for the full dataset and 0.29 for the dataset containing only one full sibling per site. I found no evidence that deforested areas restricted dispersal; pairwise estimates of genetic differentiation FST′ among forest fragments averaged 0.01 for the full dataset, and 0 for the dataset containing only one full sibling per site. Genetic distance among sites within forest fragments was significantly correlated to geographic distance for the full dataset, but there was no significant correlation for the dataset that contained only one individual from each full sibling family. This suggests that family structure can drive results of analyses of genetic structure, although reductions in sample sizes following removal of full siblings may have reduced power to detect genetic structure. Despite no evidence for restricted dispersal, the low genetic diversity found suggests that E. imperialis may be an important candidate for future conservation monitoring. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","dispersal of the orchid bee euglossa imperialis over degraded habitat","Fragmentation of habitat can decrease resource availability and restrict movement"

It is centrally important to understand patterns of dispersal for bees living in fragmented areas given the importance of pollination systems and recently documented declines in bee populations. We used population and landscape genetic techniques to characterize patterns of dispersal over a large fragmented area in southern Costa Rica for the orchid bee species Euglossa championi. First, we estimated levels of genetic differentiation among forest fragments as φ{symbol}PT, an analog to the traditional summary statistic FST, as well as two statistics that may more adequately represent levels of differentiation, G'ST and Dest. Second, we used a Bayesian approach to determine the number and composition of genetic groups in our sample. Third we investigated how genetic differentiation changes with distance. Fourth, we determined the extent to which deforested areas restrict dispersal. Finally, we estimated the extent to which there were temporal differences in allele frequencies within the same forest fragments. Within years we found low levels of differentiation even over 80 km, and no effect of land use type on level of genetic differentiation. However, we found significant genetic differentiation between years. Taken together our results suggest that there are high levels of gene flow over this geographic area, and that individuals show low site fidelity over time. © 2014 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","spatio-temporal genetic structure of a tropical bee species suggests high","Habitat destruction threatens biodiversity by reducing the amount of available"

Population persistence in fragmented areas depends on dispersal potential and maintenance of gene flow among fragments of habitat. Here we used population genetic techniques to characterize, for two equally abundant orchid bee species that differ in their physiology and ecology, levels of genetic differentiation among fragments of tropical forest in southeastern Costa Rica in a ~200 km 2 landscape. We measured population differentiation with φ PT (an analogue to the traditional summary statistic Fst), as well as two measures that may more accurately reflect the level of differentiation when highly variable loci are used: G'st and D est. We also calculated pairwise genetic distances among individuals and conducted Mantel tests to test the correlation of genetic and geographic distance, for each species. We found strong differences in genetic structure between the species. Contrary to our expectations, each measure of genetic structure revealed that the larger-bodied species, Eulaema bombiformis, had higher levels of differentiation than the smaller species, Euglossa championi. Furthermore, for Eulaema bombiformis there was a significant positive correlation of genetic and geographic distance while for Euglossa championi there was no significant positive correlation.

We also calculated rank correlations of the maximum energy intake rate with the number of nest-searching foundresses at 54 sites.

In this study, we constructed a model to estimate bumblebee nest sites, using the net energy intake rate at available food sites for workers foraging from the nest site. We hypothesized that the probability of colony establishment at a site in coordinates (x, y) was high as the sum of the net energy intake rate I(x, y) increased.

Once established, random fluctuations in birth and death rates may reduce the diversity of ecologically equivalent species if local populations are not replenished by immigrating individuals. Consequently, three key processes drive community assembly: dispersal limitation, ecological filtering, and ecological drift. However, disentangling the relative contribution of these processes remains a challenge in community ecology. We used a binomial generalized linear mixed model to test whether the occurrences of solitary bees within 46 communities in southeast Norway were driven by (1) dispersal limitation, that is, the geographic distance to the nearest site where conspecifics occurred; (2) ecological filtering, that is, if forb species richness selected for non-Ericaceae-affiliated species; and (3) ecological drift, that is, if small, isolated communities were dominated by regionally common species. The regression slopes from the model for each potential driver of community composition were compared with those expected under a null model, in which species were treated as ecologically equivalent. Both dispersal limitation and ecological filtering influenced the probability of species occurring within communities. The occurrence of species decreased with elevation, and this relationship depended on the relative commonness of species and their floral preferences. For non-Ericaceae-affiliated species, the patterns of occurrence mirrored that expected under the null (neutral) model, resulting in the same patterns as would be expected under ecological drift. In contrast, the response of Ericaceae-affiliated species differed from what would be expected from the null model. Our results also indicate that processes leading to neutral dynamics in species compositions drive a large part of the gradient in species richness in Norwegian bee communities. These processes seem related to sampling effects so that large and interconnected communities have a higher probability of including regionally rare species than small, isolated communities. Our results suggest that targeting habitats-where the influence of ecological filtering is expected to be greater than that of neutral dynamics-can increase the success of habitat management plans aimed at promoting rare species. © 2017 Sydenham et al.","disentangling the contributions of dispersal limitation, ecological drift, and ecological","The species composition within communities is highly dependent on the"

Compared to trophic and competitive interactions, the role of non-trophic facilitation among species has received less attention. Cavity-nesting bees nest in old beetle borings in dead wood, with restricted diameters corresponding to the body size of the bee species. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the functional diversity of cavity-producing wood boring beetles - in terms of cavity diameters - drives the size diversity of cavity-nesting bees. The invertebrate communities were sampled in 30 sites, located in forested landscapes along an elevational gradient. We regressed the species richness and abundance of cavity nesting bees against the species richness and abundance of wood boring beetles, non-wood boring beetles and elevation. The proportion of cavity nesting bees in bee species assemblage was regressed against the species richness and abundance of wood boring beetles. We also tested the relationships between the size diversity of cavity nesting bees and wood boring beetles. The species richness and abundance of cavity nesting bees increased with the species richness and abundance of wood boring beetles. No such relationship was found for non-wood boring beetles. The abundance of wood boring beetles was also related to an increased proportion of cavity nesting bee individuals. Moreover, the size diversity of cavity-nesting bees increased with the functional diversity of wood boring beetles. Specifically, the mean and dispersion of bee body sizes increased with the functional dispersion of large wood boring beetles. The positive relationships between cavity producing bees and cavity nesting bees suggest that non-trophic facilitative interactions between species assemblages play important roles in organizing bee species assemblages. Considering a community-wide approach may therefore be required if we are to successfully understand and conserve wild bee species assemblages in forested landscapes.","inter-assemblage facilitation: the functional diversity of cavity-producing beetles drives the","Inter-specific interactions are important drivers and maintainers of biodiversity.

The evolutionary history of species and their functional traits may provide mechanistic links between community assembly and the environment. Such links may be hierarchically structured such that the strength of environmental filtering decreases in a step-wise manner from regional conditions through landscape heterogeneity to local habitat conditions. We sampled the wild bee species assemblages in power-line strips transecting forests in south-eastern Norway. We used altitude, landscape diversity surrounding sites and plant species composition, together with total plant cover as proxies for regional, landscape and local environmental filters, respectively. The species richness and abundance of wild bees decreased with altitude. The reduction in species richness and abundance was accompanied by a phylogenetic clustering of wild bee individuals. Furthermore, regional filters followed by local filters best explained the structure of the functional species composition. Sites at high altitudes and sites with Ericaceae-dominated plant communities tended to have larger bees and a higher proportion of social and spring-emerging bees. When Bombus species were excluded from the analysis, the proportion of pollen specialists increased with the dominance of Ericaceae. Furthermore, we also found that the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional compositional turnover between sites was higher in the northern region than in the southern part of the study region. Altogether, these results suggest that regional filters drive the species richness and abundance in trait-groups whereas local filters have more descrete sorting effects. We conclude that the model of multi-level environmental filters provides a good conceptual model for community ecology. We suggest that future studies should focus on the relationship between the biogeographical history of species and their current distribution, and on the assumption that closely related species do indeed compete more intensely than distantly related species.","does multi-level environmental filtering determine the functional and phylogenetic composition","A central goal in ecology is to develop theories that"

The introduction of livestock in natural areas is a common disturbance that affects both plant and pollinator diversity and might affect their interaction. Understanding whether livestock affect a food resource for pollinators (i.e. flower abundance) and/or a pollinator assemblage (i.e. abundance and richness) has important implications for plant-pollinator interactions and still needs deeper investigation. 2. This study investigated how pollinator communities and flower abundance determined floral visitation frequency along a grazing gradient, using seven large paddocks in Patagonian Monte Desert that varied in livestock densities. Pollinator visitation frequency was measured in five of the most abundant native plant species of the region, present in all the paddocks, but that differed in reproductive strategy ranging from insect-pollinated self-compatible and self-incompatible to wind-pollinated. The influence of livestock density, insect, and flower abundance on visitation frequency was evaluated using D-separation hierarchical path models. 3. Intermediate stocking densities showed the highest insect richness and abundance. Livestock density showed a negative quadratic relationship with insect richness; hymenopterans being the main insect group in the region. Flower density decreased with the increase in livestock density. The five plant species shared several pollinator species although each one supported a distinct assemblage. 4. The path model showed that livestock was not directly associated with pollinator visitation frequency; however, this apparent lack of association was as a result of opposite forces acting together. An increase in livestock density reduced visitation frequency through a decrease in insect abundance, yet, livestock simultaneously increased the pollinator visitation rate through decreased flower abundance. 5. This study describes how changes in the density of exotic mammals can affect pollinator and flower abundance, resulting in contrasting effects on flower visitation rates with, apparently, neutral net consequences. This illustrates the complexity of responses to plant-pollinator interactions to anthropogenic disturbances that alter the ecological context.","indirect effects of grazing intensity on pollinators and floral visitation","1.

Succession in plant communities, in addition to reforestation following the creation of open sites through harvesting or natural disturbances, can affect forest faunal assemblages. Wild bees perform an important ecosystem function in human-altered and natural or seminatural ecosystems, as they are essential pollinators for both crops and wild flowering plants. To maintain high abundance and species richness for pollination services, it is important to conserve and create seminatural and natural land cover with optimal successional stages for wild bees. We examined the effects of forest succession on wild bees. In particular, we evaluated the importance of early successional stages for bees, which has been suspected but not previously demonstrated. A range of successional stages, between 1 and 178 years old, were examined in naturally regenerated and planted forests. In total 4465 wild bee individuals, representing 113 species, were captured. Results for total bees, solitary bees, and cleptoparasitic bees in both naturally regenerated and planted conifer forests indicated a higher abundance and species richness in the early successional stages. However, higher abundance and species richness of social bees in naturally regenerated forest were observed as the successional stages progressed, whereas the abundance of social bees in conifer planted forest showed a concave-shaped relationship when plotted. The results suggest that early successional stages of both naturally regenerated and conifer planted forest maintain a high abundance and species richness of solitary bees and their cleptoparasitic bees, although social bees respond differently in the early successional stages. This may imply that, in some cases, active forest stand management policies, such as the clear-cutting of planted forests for timber production, would create early successional habitats, leading to significant positive effects for bees in general.","succession influences wild bees in a temperate forest landscape: the","In many temperate terrestrial forest ecosystems, both natural human disturbances"

For our study in open agriculture landscape, we chose aculeate Hymenoptera and hoverflies as two insect, mostly pollinator groups differing in their degree of philopatry within the registered pool of our survey where hoverflies were represented by common generalist species showing high mobility. We tested if these groups appeared in significantly different species numbers in two most contrasting habitats typical for the European open agriculture landscape: patches of flower-rich, semi-natural habitats around fields with a variety of nesting sites and wheat fields in proximity that represented a non-viable agricultural habitat with no nesting and foraging opportunities. For this purpose, comparison of results from attractant based (pan traps) and observational (transect walks) methods were used. Philopatric species were detected in significantly different species numbers in the two habitat types using both methods. In contrast, highly mobile non-philopatric species showed a mixed pattern.

These detritus decorations have been hypothesised to camouflage the spider from predators or prey and thus reduce predation risk or increase foraging success. In the present study, we tested these two alternative hypotheses simultaneously using two types of detritus decorations (prey remain and egg sac) built by Cyclosa mulmeinensis (Thorell). By monitoring the possible responses of predators to spiders on their webs with and without decorations in the field, we tested whether web decorations would reduce the mortality of spiders. Wasp predators were observed to fly in the vicinity of webs with decorations slightly more often than in the vicinity of webs without decorations but there were very few attacks on spiders by wasps. By comparing the insect interception rates of webs with and without decorations in the field, we tested whether web decorations would increase the foraging success. Webs decorated with prey remains or egg sacs intercepted more insects than those without in the field. By calculating colour contrasts of both prey-remain and egg-sac decorations against spiders viewed by bird (blue tits) and hymenopteran (e.g. wasps) predators as well as hymenopteran (bees) prey, we showed that C. mulmeinensis spiders on webs with egg-sac decorations were invisible to both hymenopteran prey and predators and bird predators over short and long distances. While spiders on webs with prey-remain decorations were invisible to both hymenopterans and birds over short distances, spiders on webs with prey-remain decorations were visible to both predators and prey over long distances. Our results thus suggest that decorating webs with prey remains and egg sacs in C. mulmeinensis may primarily function as camouflage to conceal the spider from insects rather than as prey attractants, possibly contributing to the interception of more insect prey. However, the detritus decorations exhibit varying success as camouflage against predators, depending on whether predators are jumping spiders, wasps or birds, as well as on the decoration type.","detritus decorations of an orb-weaving spider, cyclosa mulmeinensis (thorell): for","Many species of the orb-web spider genus Cyclosa often adorn"

Bee communities in 24 mango (Mangifera indica L.) orchards in heavily modified landscapes (61-99% anthropogenic land cover) were compared. We predicted that bees would be more species rich in orchards with higher flower diversity, whereas small-sized bees with non-eusocial and/or below-ground nesting habits would be more sensitive to human disturbance, and hence rare. 3 Twenty-eight species were caught and individuals of genus Apis comprised >92% of 3842 bees sampled and dominated all 24 sites. 4 Habitat effects on bee richness and abundance were stronger at the farm scale than at the landscape scale. At the farm scale, total bee richness and abundance, as well as small, non-eusocial and below-ground nesting bee richness and abundance, were negatively associated with field size and positively associated with flowering plant diversity. The percentage of urban land cover within a 1-km radius was weakly but positively related to total bee richness and small-sized bee richness; total bee abundance was positively associated with wetland cover. 5 A greater diversity of flowering plants retained in smaller fields maintained higher bee richness and abundances, particularly small-sized bees.

In this study, we employed a novel assessment method based on the relative potency factor to calculate the integrated residue of seven neonicotinoids in pollen and honey samples collected from noncrop plants in 12 stations of Zhejiang province in three consecutive months. The integrated concentration of neonicotinoids (IMIRPF) ranged from no detected (ND) to 34.93 ng/g in pollen and ND to 8.51 ng/g in honey. Acetamiprid showed the highest detection frequency of 41.7%, followed by clothianidin (33.3%) and dinotefuran (22.2%).

An alternative signal could be the vibrations of the comb at 200-300 Hz generated by dancing bees but which, without amplification, may not be large enough to alert remote dance-followers. We describe here, however, an unexpected property of honeycomb when it is subjected to vibration at around 200 Hz that would represent an effective amplification of the vibratory signals for remote dance-followers. We find that, at a specific distance from the origin of an imposed vibration, the walls across a single comb cell abruptly reverse the phase of their displacement and move in opposite directions to one another. Behavioural measurements show that the distance from which the majority of remote dance-followers are recruited coincides with the location of this phase-reversal phenomenon relative to the signal source. We propose that effective signal amplification by the phase-reversal phenomenon occurs when bees straddle a cell across which the phase reversal is expressed. Such a bee would be subjected to a situation in which the legs were moving towards and away from one another instead of in the same direction. In this manner, remote dance-followers could be alerted to a dancer performing in their vicinity.","phase reversal of vibratory signals in honeycomb may assist dancing","Forager honeybees dancing on the comb are able to attract"

No obvious difference in within-hive behavior was noted between the temperature-treated bees and the foster-colony bees. However, when the temperature-treated bees became foragers and were trained to visit a feeder 200 m from the hive, they exhibited clear differences in dance performance that could be correlated with the temperatures at which they had been raised: bees raised at 32°C completed only ≈20% of the dance circuits when compared with bees of the higher-temperature group.

Thus, food sites should often be visited in order of proximity. However, resources vary in multiple attributes, so it may be beneficial to bypass some sites to visit others first. We used a foraging experiment on wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda to determine whether they prioritize high-reward food sites over low-reward sites. Five baited platforms were set in a pentagon within the range of one group. Trials usually consisted of single foragers but when multiple individuals participated, food competition occurred. In phase 1, platforms were baited equally. Individuals immediately found the shortest path and there was no relationship between experience and distance travelled. From phase 1, expected numbers of first visits to each platform were calculated for phases 2 and 3, where one or two platforms were six times more rewarding than others. In combined results from all trials with high-reward sites, individuals did not travel to highly rewarding platforms first, unless competitors were present. Vervets that foraged alone usually accessed food sites in order of proximity and saved on travel costs (consistent with a nearest-neighbour rule or a convex hull heuristic), regardless of the location of high-reward site(s); while monkeys in competition prioritized high-reward sites (a 'take-the-best' or gravity heuristic) and sometimes bypassed low-reward sites in an attempt to increase food acquisition at the expense of travel costs. When two sites were six times more rewarding, travel patterns changed to a greater focus on high-reward sites by single foragers and a tendency to ignore low-reward platforms. These results confirm that vervets integrate distance/reward information over multiple food sources, show spatial discounting in the right circumstances and optimize their routing decisions in different ways depending on the social context.

We studied the visitation of native bees to apple, pear, apricot, and sweet cherry over 2 years. Thirty species of bees visited the flowers but, except for pear flowers, most were uncommon compared to honey bees. Evidence that honey bees prevented native bees from foraging on orchard crop flowers was equivocal: generally, honey bee and native bee visitation rates to the flowers were not negatively correlated, nor were native bee visitation rates positively correlated with distance of orchards from honey bee hives. Conversely, competition was tentatively suggested by much larger numbers of honey bees than natives on the flowers of apples, apricots and cherry; and by the large increase of native bees on pears, where honey bee numbers were low.

The behaviour of pairs of bees, one (donor) fed with 50-μl sucrose solutions and another unfed recipient, was analysed as a function of the sucrose concentration, the concentration at constant viscosity (kept constant by adding tylose, an inert polysaccharide), and of the viscosity of a 30% sucrose solution. By increasing the concentration of solutions, the rate at which the solution was transferred to recipient bees (transfer rate of solution, in μl/s) increased up to a maximum value for 30% sucrose solution, and decreased beyond this concentration (concentration experiment). At constant viscosity, no modulation was observed for the lower sugar concentration range (10-30%), while the transfer rate of solution clearly increased beyond 30% (concentration experiment at constant viscosity). For the 30% sucrose solution, the transfer rate decreased with increasing viscosity (viscosity experiment). If only the sucrose compound is comparatively analysed, the transfer rate of sucrose (in mg/s) increased similarly in the first two experiments. These results give behavioural evidence suggesting that donor bees are capable of modulating the trophallactic food transfer as related tO the sucrose concentrations carried into their crops within a considerable wide range, but viscosity prevents it. It also suggests that trophallactic transfer rate does not depend on abdominal volume, for even when all donor bees attained similar loads (50 μl), transfer rate of solution increased along with the offered sucrose concentration.

For example, pollinators may limit species’ ranges if floral abundance or floral attractiveness is reduced at range margins, thus causing lower pollinator visitation and reduced reproductive output. METHODS: To test if pollinators influence the altitudinal distribution of Erythronium montanum (Liliaceae) at Mount Rainier National Park, we asked whether (1) seed production in this species relies on pollinators, (2) seed production and pollen limitation is greatest at range limits, and (3) pollinator visitation rates (either overall or by individual taxonomic groups) reflect patterns of seed production and pollen limitation. RESULTS: From this three-year study, we established that this plant does rely on pollinators for fruit set and we found that pollen limitation trended toward being higher at the upper range limit in some years, but not consistently year to year. Insect visitation rates did not mirror spatial patterns of pollen limitation, but annually variable pollinator composition suggested differential importance of some pollinator taxonomic groups (specifically, bumblebees may be better pollinators than syrphid flies). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that while pollinators are critical for the reproductive success of this high mountain wildflower, plant-pollinator interactions do not obviously drive the distribution of this species. Nonetheless, high spatio-temporal variability in range-wide plant-pollinator dynamics may complicate responses to climate change. © 2016 Botanical Society of America.","lilies at the limit: variation in plant-pollinator interactions across an","PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Many studies assume climatic factors are"

Pollination is a major ecosystem service in which insects, particularly bees, play an important role for the reproduction of most angiosperms. Currently, this service is considered under threat due to reported bee declines. Moderately urbanised areas could be important for pollinators and pollination; however, compared to agricultural and natural systems, they are poorly studied. 2. Here, we investigated the relative effects of local habitat quality and anthropogenic land use across an agricultural to urban gradient for local plant and flying insect communities. We quantified local flower visitor networks and related network architecture to these local and landscape factors using structural equationmodelling. Flower visitor network architecture is often assumed to act as a surrogate for the ecosystem service of pollination. To test this idea, we related network metrics to pollination of four experimental, insect pollinator-dependent plant species. 3. Overall, local land use markedly influenced plant and flying insect communities. Flower richness and bee richness were higher in urban compared to agricultural areas. Flower visitor network metrics (e.g. linkage density) increased with the proportion of urban area surrounding a site. Also, relative to agricultural areas, urban flower visitors were more generalised and foraged from a higher number of plant species, likely a consequence of higher urban flowering plant richness. However, urban bees also visited a lower proportion of the available flowering plants (higher specialisation). Surprisingly, linkage density, network specialisation and flower visitor generality were not related to pollination of our four experimental plants per se. Rather, it was the proportion of urban cover, flying insect abundance and bee richness that were positively related to pollination. 4. Our findings show strong effects of local land use on plant and flying insect communities and flower visitor interaction networks. We observed increased overall visitation rates and pollination services to our experimental plants in urban compared to agricultural areas, despite increased urban flower visitor generality. Indeed, flower visitor network metrics were a poor proxy of provision of the ecosystem service of pollination. Nevertheless, our results point to potential facilitating effects of diverse urban floral and bee communities for pollination.","the structure of flower visitor networks in relation to pollination","1.

Results showed that honey bees responded to both the above variations more or less in the same way. Bees significantly decreased their crop load, significantly decreased the flower handling time, significantly decreased the inter-flower flight time for both an increase in flower-patch distance and inter-flower distance. Significant change in net energy gain (gain-cost/time) with reference to increase in inter-flower distance only and significant increase in energetic efficiency (gain-cost/cost) for both an increase in inter-flower distance and flower patch distance. Bees didn't maximize their net rate of energetic intake while foraging, but increased their energetic efficiency in response to an increase in distances of nectar source from the hives and flower densities. The evidence from this and related studies suggests that the energetic efficiency is a guiding principle underlying the strategy of nectar collection in honey bees.","studies on central place foraging in the indian honey bee,","Aspects of central place foraging were studied in worker honey"

Twelve honeybee colonies were used per treatment group, 4 each located at the field edge (on-field site), at approximately 500m and 1000m from the field. A total of nearly 300 newly emerged bees per colony were fitted (tagged) with Mic3 radio frequency identification (RFID) transponders and introduced into each of the 36 study hives. The RFID readers fitted to the entrances of the test colonies were used to monitor the activity of the tagged bees for the duration of the 5-wk flowering period of the crop. These activity data were analyzed to assess any impact on flight activity of bees foraging on the treated compared with untreated crops. Honeybees were seen to be actively foraging within all 3 treatment groups during the exposure period. The data for the more than 3000 RFID-tagged bees and more than 90000 foraging flights monitored throughout the exposure phase for the study follow the same trends across the treatment and controls and at each of the 3 apiary distances, indicating that there were no effects from foraging on the treated crop.

However, colony-level studies on the effects of neonicotinoids in field studies are limited, primarily due to their complexity and the resources required. This paper reports the combined results of two large-scale colony-feeding studies, each with 6 weeks of continuous dosing of 12 colonies per treatment (24 control) to 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50 or 100 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose solution. Exposure continued beyond dosing with residues present in stored nectar and bee-bread. The studies were conducted in an area with limited alternative forage and colonies were required to forage for pollen and additional nectar The studies provide colony-level endpoints: significant effects (reductions in bees, brood) were observed after exposure to the two highest dose rates, colony loss occurred at the highest dose rate, but colonies were able to recover (2–3 brood cycles after the end of dosing) after dosing with 50 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose. No significant colony-level effects were observed at lower dose rates. The data reported here support the conclusions of previous colony-level crop-based field studies with thiamethoxam, in which residues in pollen and nectar were an order of magnitude below the colony-level NOEC of 37.5 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose. The feeding study data are also compared to the outcomes of regulatory Tier 1 risk assessments conducted using guidance provided by the USA, Canada, Brazil and the EU regulatory authorities.

The approach comprised 2 stages. In the first stage, honeybee colonies were exposed to a commercial formulation of glyphosate applied to flowering Phacelia tanacetifolia with glyphosate residues quantified in relevant matrices (pollen and nectar) collected by foraging bees on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 postapplication and glyphosate levels in larvae were measured on days 4 and 7. Glyphosate levels in pollen were approximately 10 times higher than in nectar and glyphosate demonstrated rapid decline in both matrices. Residue data along with foraging rates and food requirements of the colony were then used to set dose rates in the effects study. In the second stage, the toxicity of technical glyphosate to developing honeybee larvae and pupae, and residues in larvae, were then determined by feeding treated sucrose directly to honeybee colonies at dose rates that reflect worst-case exposure scenarios. There were no significant effects from glyphosate observed in brood survival, development, and mean pupal weight. Additionally, there were no biologically significant levels of adult mortality observed in any glyphosate treatment group. Significant effects were observed only in the fenoxycarb toxic reference group and included increased brood mortality and a decline in the numbers of bees and brood. Mean glyphosate residues in larvae were comparable at 4 days after spray application in the exposure study and also following dosing at a level calculated from the mean measured levels in pollen and nectar, showing the applicability and robustness of the approach for dose setting with honeybee brood studies. This study has developed a versatile and predictive approach for use in higher tier honeybee toxicity studies. It can be used to realistically quantify exposure of colonies to pesticides to allow the appropriate dose rates to be determined, based on realistic worst-case residues in pollen and nectar and estimated intake by the colony, as shown by the residue analysis. Previous studies have used the standard methodology developed primarily to identify pesticides with insect-growth disrupting properties of pesticide formulations, which are less reliant on identifying realistic exposure scenarios. However, this adaptation of the method can be used to determine dose-response effects of colony level exposure to pesticides with a wide range of properties. This approach would limit the number of replicated tunnel or field-scale studies that need to be undertaken to assess effects on honeybee brood and may be of particular benefit where residues in pollen and nectar are crop- and/or formulation-specific, such as systemic seed treatments and granular applications. © 2014 The Authors.","evaluating exposure and potential effects on honeybee brood (apis mellifera)","This study aimed to develop an approach to evaluate potential"

We evaluated whether local temporal dynamics of ecological outcome in the interaction between the moth Greya politella (Prodoxidae) and its host plant Lithophragma parviflorum (Saxifragaceae) are likely to mitigate or magnify geographic differences in ecological outcome found in earlier studies. The moths are highly host-specific pollinating floral parasites, and the mutualism can be swamped in some populations by the presence of effective co-pollinators. Hence, differing community contexts can shift the outcome of the interaction from mutualism to commensalism or antagonism. During each of four years, we evaluated the effect of Greya oviposition on seed development through a paired design that controlled for plant genotype and microenvironment. At Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge in Washington State, the interaction was significantly mutualistic in all four years. Mutualism in this population was indicated by a higher probability of development of capsules visited by ovipositing Greya than capsules not visited by Greya on the same plant. At Rapid River, Idaho, the interaction was commensalistic in three years and antagonistic in one year. Antagonism in this population was indicated by selective withering of capsules containing Greya eggs. Overall, the results suggest stable geographic differences in the range of ecological outcomes in this plant-insect interaction under different community contexts.","temporal dynamics of antagonism and mutualism in a geographically variable","Variation among sites and years in the local ecological outcome"

Most assessments of impact rely on correlational data or other indirect measures. Yet few studies have evaluated invasion effects using multiple, simultaneously applied monitoring and experimental approaches, in order to compare easily obtained metrics with more difficult but direct measures of reproductive success or population dynamics. In this study, I use data from an experimental test of introduced honey bee (Apis mellifera) impacts on native bumble bees (Bombus spp.) to address two major questions: 1) how well did observational data on niche overlap and spatial correlations between Apis and Bombus predict the results of experimental tests of competitive effects? and 2) how well did effects of the experimental Apis manipulations on Bombus foragers, which are easy to observe, predict changes in reproductive success of colonies, which are difficult to measure? Niche overlap between Apis and Bombus varied substantially, but increased to levels as high as 80-90% during periods of resource scarcity. Correlations between numbers of Apis foragers and numbers of Bombus foragers were also highly variable, but I detected a significant negative relationship in only one of the seven months observed. In contrast, the experimental results showed that mean numbers of Bombus foragers observed on a given transect increased significantly with greater distance from introduced Apis colonies. Of these three measures (niche overlap, correlations in abundances, and effects of experimental introductions), only the experimental data on forager abundances accurately estimated competitive effects on colony reproductive success previously reported for the same experiment, and the correlational data in particular completely failed to predict the effects observed in the experimental study. This work suggests that great caution is warranted in making assessments of invasion impact on the basis of spatial or temporal correlations between invasive and native species. Thus, investing in even small and limited experimental studies may be more valuable than extensive observational work in quantifying invasion impacts. © OIKOS.","detecting the effects of introduced species: a case study of","Developing tools for rapid assessment of introduced species impacts is"

In particular, the presence of a rewarding plant species may increase the rate of pollinator visitation to a less rewarding species in its vicinity, but the beneficial increase in visitation may be counteracted by a detrimental increase in heterospecific pollen transfer. We assessed this trade-off using bumble-bees foraging over a gradual spatial transition between two plant species in an indoor cage experiment. Methods: We used two 'species' of artificial flowers - one more rewarding than the other - in arrays that varied in the degree of species intermingling. The flowers dispensed and received powdered food dyes serving as pollen analogues. Captive bumble-bees visited to collect sucrose solution. We quantified dye delivery to the adhesive-tape 'stigmas' in flowers by spectrophotometry. Key Results: Across the spatial transition between species, the less attractive species received more dye (more bee visits) when in proximity to the more attractive species than it did when alone, but the larger dye loads were less pure (more heterospecific pollen transfer). The decline in purity cancelled out the gain in acquisition, so conspecific pollen receipt by the less attractive species was neutrally affected. The more attractive species received fewer visits when surrounded by the less attractive species, so the interaction between the two species was amensalism when considering conspecific pollen reception. Conclusions: Pollinator-mediated interactions between plant species depend on pollination quantity and purity, both of which can depend on spatial intermingling. © 2018 The Author(s).","effects of spatial patterning of co-flowering plant species on pollination","Background and Aims: If two plant species share pollinators, it"

The shapes of these curves determine what patterns of resource allocation can be evolutionarily stable. Although SA theory has stimulated creative thinking about plant sexual tactics, quantifying the shapes of male and female gain curves has proven so difficult that other approaches must be considered. I contrast sex allocation theory to a different, emerging viewpoint, pollen presentation theory (PPT), which attempts to address variation in reproductive success by measuring and modeling the quantitative fates of pollen grains. Models suggest that RS through male function depends heavily on the packaging and gradual dispensing of pollen to pollinators, even with the amount of investment held constant. Many plants do deploy pollen gradually, through morphological and ""behavioral"" mechanisms that range from obvious to subtle. They may thereby influence many aspects of the evolution of sexual modes in plants, including transitions between dioecy and cosexuality. After reviewing the main implications of the models, I discuss recent work aimed at testing some key assumptions and predictions by functional and comparative studies in the genus Penstemon. Species of Penstemon conform to PPT predictions that bee-adapted flowers will restrict per-visit pollen availability more than hummingbird-adapted flowers.","tactics for male reproductive success in plants: contrasting insights of","The basic tenet of sex allocation theory is that an"

A common goal is to detect range shifts in response to climate change, including changes in the centre of the population's distribution (the centre of gravity, COG), population boundaries and area occupied. Conventional estimators, such as the abundance-weighted average (AWA) estimator for COG, confound range shifts with changes in the spatial distribution of available survey data and may be biased when the distribution of survey data shifts over time. AWA also does not estimate the standard error of COG in individual years and cannot incorporate data from multiple survey designs. To explicitly account for changes in the spatial distribution of survey effort, we propose an alternative species distribution function (SDF) estimator. The SDF approach involves calculating distribution metrics, including COG, population boundary and area occupied, directly from the predicted species distribution or density function. We illustrate the SDF approach using a spatiotemporal model that is available as an r package. Using simulated data, we confirm that the SDF substantially decreases bias in COG estimates relative to the AWA estimator. We then illustrate the method by analysing data from two data sets spanning 1977-2013 for 18 marine fishes along the U.S. West Coast. In our case study, the SDF estimator shows significant northward shifts for six of 18 species (with southward shifts for only 2), where two species (darkblotched and greenstriped rockfishes) have both a northward shift and a decreased area occupied. Pelagic species (e.g. Pacific hake and spiny dogfish) have more variable distribution than bottom-associated species. We also find substantial differences between AWA and SDF estimates of COG that are likely caused by shifts in sampling distribution (which affect the AWA but not the SDF estimator). We caution that common estimators for range shift can yield inappropriate inference whenever sampling designs have shifted over time. We conclude by suggesting further improvements in model-based approaches to analysing climate impacts, including methods addressing the impact of local and regional temperature changes on species distribution.","model-based inference for estimating shifts in species distribution, area occupied","Changing climate is already impacting the spatial distribution of many"

However, the phenology of floral resources is often overlooked in these schemes - a factor which may be limiting their success. Our study characterizes and quantifies the phenology of nectar resources at the whole-farm scale on replicate farms in Southwestern UK throughout the flowering season. We quantify the corresponding nectar demands of a subset of common wild pollinators (bumblebees) to compare nectar supply and pollinator demand throughout the year, thereby identifying periods of supply-demand deficit. We record strong seasonal fluctuations in farmland nectar supplies, with two main peaks of nectar production (May and July) and a considerable ""June Gap"" in between. March and August/September are also periods of low nectar availability. Comparing the phenology of nectar supply with the phenology of bumblebee nectar demand reveals ""hunger gaps"" during March and much of August/September when supply is unlikely to meet demand. Permanent pasture and woodland produced the greatest share of farmland nectar because of their large area; however, linear features such as hedgerows and field margins provided the greatest nectar per unit area. Fifty percent of total nectar was supplied by just three species (Allium ursinum, Cirsium arvense and Trifolium repens), but some less productive species (e.g. Hedera helix and Taraxacum agg.) were important in ensuring phenological continuity of nectar supply. Synthesis and applications. By comparing the phenology of farmland nectar supply with the phenology of pollinator demand, we demonstrate that the timing of nectar supply may be as important as total nectar production in limiting farmland pollinator populations. Considering phenology in the design of agri-environment or restoration schemes is therefore likely to improve their suitability for pollinators. Plant species which flower during periods of resource deficit (early spring and late summer) should be prioritized in schemes which aim to conserve or restore pollinator populations. Maintaining a range of semi-natural habitats with complementary flowering phenologies (e.g. woodland, hedgerows and field margins) will ensure a more continuous supply of nectar on farmland, thereby supporting pollinators for their entire flight season.","phenology of farmland floral resources reveals seasonal gaps in nectar","Floral resources are known to be important in regulating wild"

Features of the model: We use both a state-dependent life-history model implemented by stochastic dynamic programming (SDPM) and an individual-based model (IBM) to capture the dynamic nature of behavioural preferences in feeding. Variables in the SDPM include energy reserves, skill levels, energy and handling time per single prey item, metabolic rate, the rates at which skills are learned and forgotten, the effect of skills on handling time, and the relationship between energy reserves and fitness. Additional variables in the IBM include the probability of successful weaning, the logistic dynamics of the prey species with stochastic recruitment, the intensity of top-down control of prey by predators, the mean and variance in skill levels of new recruits, and the extent to which learned information can be transmitted via matrilineal social learning. Key range of variables: We explore the effects of approaching the time horizon in the SDPM, changing the extent to which skills can improve with experience, increasing the rates of learning or forgetting of skills, changing whether the learning curve is constant, accelerating ('J'-shaped) or decelerating ('r'-shaped), changing both mean and maximum possible energy reserves, changing metabolic costs of foraging, and changing the rate of encounter with prey. Conclusions: The model results show that the following factors increase the degree of prey specialization observed in a predator population: (1) Experience handling a prey type can substantially improve foraging skills for that prey. (2) There is limited ability to retain complex learned skills for multiple prey types. (3) The learning curve for acquiring new foraging skills is accelerating, or J-shaped. (4) The metabolic costs of foraging are high relative to available energy reserves. (5) Offspring can learn foraging skills from their mothers (matrilineal social learning). (6) Food abundance is limited, such that average individual energy reserves are low Additionally, the following factors increase the likelihood of alternative specializations co-occurring in a predator population: (1) The predator exerts effective top-down control of prey abundance, resulting in frequency-dependent dynamics. (2) There is stochastic variation in prey population dynamics, but this variation is neither too extreme in magnitude nor too 'slow' with respect to the time required for an individual forager to learn new foraging skills. For a given predator population, we deduce that the degree of specialization will be highest for those prey types requifing complex capture or handling skills, while prey species that are both profitable and easy to capture and handle will be included in the diet of all individuals. Frequency-dependent benefits of selecting alternative prey types, combined with the ability of foragers to improve their foraging skills by learning, and transmit learned skills to offspring, can result in behaviourally mediated foraging specialization, and also lead to the co-existence of alternative specializations. The extent of such specialization is predicted to be a variable trait, increasing in locations or years when intra-specific competition is high relative to inter-specific competition.","learning to be different: acquired skills, social learning, frequency dependence,","Question: How does the ability to improve foraging skills by"

Sulfoxaflor is a recently developed systemic insecticide in the new sulfoximine class of insecticides and has shown high efficiency against a wide range of pest insects. The main objective of this study was therefore to assess the effects of sulfoxaflor on the buff-tailed or large earth bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), known as an important generalist pollinator of wild plants and many agricultural crops worldwide. To achieve this objective, a laboratory bioassay with queenless bumblebee microcolonies that had been previously developed and used to assess for both toxicity and effects on foraging behaviour in B. terrestris for neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam), was specifically employed. Here, microcolonies of B. terrestris workers, with or without the need to forage for food, were exposed to sugar water supplemented with field-realistic concentrations of sulfoxaflor (starting from 15 µg/ml to 5 and 1 µg/ml) via oral exposure during 15 days. In addition to a significant reduction in bumblebee worker survival, the results also indicated that there was no higher toxicity caused by sulfoxaflor when the bumblebees had to forage for their food compared to when they did not have to forage. These results could guide future studies in this context and could be used in debates on insecticides and/or risk assessment of pesticides with potential effects on behaviour in bumblebees and other pollinators in general. © 2019 E.

Furthermore, the effects of temperature may alter the outcome of biotic interactions, such as those with pathogens and parasites. In the context of host-parasite interactions, the beneficial acclimation hypothesis posits that shifts away from acclimation or optimum performance temperatures will impose physiological stress on hosts and will affect their ability to resist parasite infection. We investigated the beneficial acclimation hypothesis in a bumble bee-trypanosome parasite system. Freshly emerged adult worker bumble bees, Bombus impatiens, were acclimated to 21, 26, or 29 degrees C. They were subsequently experimentally exposed to the parasite, Crithidia bombi, and placed in a performance temperature that was the same as the acclimation temperature (constant) or one of the other temperatures (mismatched). Prevalence of parasite transmission was checked 4 and 6 days post-parasite exposure, and infection intensity in the gut was quantified at 8 days post-exposure. Parasite strain, host colony, and host size had significant effects on transmission prevalence and infection load. However, neither transmission nor infection intensity were significantly different between constant and mismatched thermal regimes. Furthermore, acclimation temperature, performance temperature, and the interaction of acclimation and performance temperatures had no significant effects on infection outcomes. These results, counter to predictions of the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, suggest that infection outcomes in this host-parasite system are robust to thermal variation within typically experienced ranges. This could be a consequence of adaptation to commonly experienced natural thermal regimes or a result of individual and colony level heterothermy in bumble bees. However, thermal variability may still have a detrimental effect on more sensitive stages or species, or when extreme climatic events push temperatures outside of the normally experienced range.","infection outcomes are robust to thermal variability in a bumble","Climate change-related increases in thermal variability and rapid temperature shifts"

Hornets seem to use multiple navigational cues for visiting a familiar feeding place. They could orient towards the feeding place immediately after they rose in air from the nest without directly viewing the feeder. They could visit the feeding place after dark at a luminosity 8 lux. These data suggest that they can navigate for some distance with few external cues. Hornets also seem to rely on visual cues for their mid-range navigation. They used some structures on their way as navigational landmarks to negotiate. Individual hornets are supposed to have their own landmarks. Olfactory cues seem to be used to find a new feeding place or to recruit other member. In the approach flight hornets seemed to use multiple visual cues such as the visual characteristics of the feeder and the wider scenery around the feeder. Even if the feeder in training was removed during the test, they flew with a smooth course as if they were pin-pointing the missing feeder, but without sitting on the ground. Hornets learnt how to fly to reach the feeder without external cues after passing by the last visual landmark under conditions with extremely poor visual cues. The present work suggests that hornets retain multiple navigational cues during repeated foraging behavior, and which cues they use seems to depend upon environmental conditions.","foraging navigation of hornets studied in natural habitats and laboratory","Foraging flights have been studied in three species of hornets"

Here, the impact of three reduced-risk insecticides - azadirachtin, spinosad and chlorantraniliprole - was assessed in two species of stingless bees, Partamona helleri and Scaptotrigona xanthotrica, which are important native pollinators in Neotropical America. The neonicotinoid imidacloprid was used as a positive control. Spinosad exhibited high oral and contact toxicities in adult workers of both species at the recommended label rates, with median survival times (LT(50)s) ranging from 1 to 4 h, whereas these estimates were below 15 min for imidacloprid. Azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole exhibited low toxicity at the recommended label rates, with negligible mortality that did not allow LT50 estimation. Sublethal behavioural assessments of these two insecticides indicated that neither one of them affected the overall group activity of workers of the two species. However, both azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole impaired individual flight take-off of P. helleri and S. xanthotrica worker bees, which may compromise foraging activity, potentially leading to reduced colony survival.

Phylogenetic studies show multiple gains and losses of floral nectar in the species-rich genus Pedicularis. Here we explore how experimental addition of nectar to a supposedly nectarless species, P. dichotoma, influences pollinator foraging behaviour. Methods The liquid (nectar) at the base of the corolla tube in P. dichotoma was investigated during anthesis. Sugar components were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. To understand evolutionary transitions of nectar, artificial nectar was added to corolla tubes and the reactions of bumble-bee pollinators to extra nectar were examined. Key Results A quarter of unmanipulated P. dichotoma plants contained measurable nectar, with 0.01-0.49 L per flower and sugar concentrations ranging from 4 to 39 %. The liquid surrounding the ovaries in the corolla tubes was sucrose-dominant nectar, as in two sympatric nectariferous Pedicularis species. Bumble-bees collected only pollen from control (unmanipulated) flowers of P. dichotoma, adopting a sternotribic pollination mode, but switched to foraging for nectar in manipulated (nectar-supplemented) flowers, adopting a nototribic pollination mode as in nectariferous species. This altered foraging behaviour did not place pollen on the ventral side of the bees, and sternotribic pollination also decreased. Conclusion Our study is the first to quantify variation in nectar production in a supposedly nectarless' Pedicularis species. Flower manipulations by adding nectar suggested that gain (or loss) of nectar would quickly result in an adaptive behavioural shift in the pollinator, producing a new location for pollen deposition and stigma contact without a shift to other pollinators. Frequent gains of nectar in Pedicularis species would be beneficial by enhancing pollinator attraction in unpredictable pollination environments.","nectar supplementation changes pollinator behaviour and pollination mode in pedicularis","Backgrounds and Aims Gain or loss of floral nectar, an"

At a landscape scale, bee communities are affected by habitat composition, anthropogenic land use, and fragmentation. However, little information is available on local-scale spatial distribution of bee communities within habitats that are uniform at the landscape scale. We studied a bee community along with floral and nesting resources over a 32 km2 area of uninterrupted Mediterranean scrubland. Our objectives were (i) to analyze floral and nesting resource composition at the habitat scale. We ask whether these resources follow a geographical pattern across the scrubland at bee-foraging relevant distances; (ii) to analyze the distribution of bee composition across the scrubland. Bees being highly mobile organisms, we ask whether bee composition shows a homogeneous distribution or else varies spatially. If so, we ask whether this variation is irregular or follows a geographical pattern and whether bees respond primarily to flower or to nesting resources; and (iii) to establish whether body size influences the response to local resource availability and ultimately spatial distribution. We obtained 6580 specimens belonging to 98 species. Despite bee mobility and the absence of environmental barriers, our bee community shows a clear geographical pattern. This pattern is mostly attributable to heterogeneous distribution of small (&lt;55 mg) species (with presumed smaller foraging ranges), and is mostly explained by flower resources rather than nesting substrates. Even then, a large proportion (54.8%) of spatial variability remains unexplained by flower or nesting resources. We conclude that bee communities are strongly conditioned by local effects and may exhibit spatial heterogeneity patterns at a scale as low as 500-1000 m in patches of homogeneous habitat.

However, high honey bee densities may have an impact on local pollen and nectar availability, which in turn may negatively affect other pollinators. This is exacerbated by the ability of honey bees to recruit foragers to highly rewarding flower patches. We measured floral resource consumption in rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris) in 21 plots located at different distances from apiaries in the scrubland of Garraf Natural Park (Barcelona), and related these measures to visitation rates of honey bees, bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and other pollinators. In the same plots, we measured flower density, and used pan traps to characterize the wild bee community. Flower resource consumption was largely explained by honey bee visitation and marginally by bumblebee visitation. After accounting for flower density, plots close to apiaries had lower wild bee biomass. This was due to a lower abundance of large bee species, those more likely to be affected by honey bee competition. We conclude that honey bees are the main contributors to pollen/nectar consumption of the two main flowering plants in the scrubland, and that at the densities currently occurring in the park (3.5 hives/km2) the wild bee community is being affected.

A key assumption is that corridors facilitate exchange rates of organisms between otherwise isolated patches. If the organisms are pollinators, corridors may be important for maintaining genetically viable populations of the plants that they pollinate. We tested the hypothesis that corridors increase the movement of insect pollinators into patches of habitat and thereby increase pollen transfer for two species of plants, one pollinated by butterflies (Lantana camara) and the other by bees and wasps (Rudbeckia hirta). We worked in an experimental landscape consisting of 40 ≥1-ha patches of early-successional habitat in a matrix of forest. Within each of eight experimental units, two patches were connected by a corridor (150 X 25 m), and three were not. Patch shape varied to control for the area added by the presence of a corridor. Differences in patch shape also allowed us to test alternative hypotheses of how corridors might function. The Traditional Corridor Hypothesis posits that corridors increase immigration and emigration by functioning as movement conduits between patches. The Drift Fence Hypothesis posits that corridors function by ""capturing"" organisms dispersing through the matrix, redirecting them into associated habitat patches. Using fluorescent powder to track pollen, we found that pollen transfer by butterflies between patches connected by a corridor was significantly higher than between unconnected patches (all values mean ± 1 SE: 59% ± 9.2% vs. 25% ± 5.2% of flowers receiving pollen). Likewise, pollen transfer by bees and wasps was significantly higher between connected patches than between unconnected patches (30% ± 4.2% vs. 14.5% ± 2.2%). These results support the Traditional Corridor Hypothesis. There was little support, however, for the Drift Fence Hypothesis. To generalize our results to a larger scale, we measured the probability of pollen transfer by butterflies as a function of distance along a 2000 X 75 m corridor. Pollen transfer probability exponentially declined with respect to distance and successfully predicted pollen transfer probability on the scale of our previous experiment.

A greenhouse experiment determined that spur curvature of I. capensis flowers has a broad-sense heritability of 0.636.

The highly complex social organization of honeybees is mediated through pheromones. Releaser pheromones cause rapid changes in the behaviour of the recipient, while primer pheromones have relatively slow and long-term effects on the physiology and behaviour of the recipient. Queen retinue pheromone (QRP) is a blend of the nine compounds (9-oxo-(E)-2-decenoic acid, (R)- and (S)-9-hydroxy-(E)-2-decenoic acid, methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, 4-hydroxy-3-methyoxyphenylethanol, methyl oleate, coniferyl alcohol, palmityl alcohol, and linolenic acid) and acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting worker bees to the queen. QRP also acts as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting the ovary development of worker bees. An essential component of QRP, 9-oxo-(E)-2-decenoic acid, acts as a long-distance sex pheromone. Defensive behaviour of honeybees is induced and modulated by alarm pheromones. The essential alarm pheromone component is isopentyl acetate (IPA). The unsaturated derivative of IPA, 3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl acetate, was found in colonies of Africanized honeybees. The Nasanov gland of worker bees produces a pheromone (a blend of nerol, geraniol, (E)- and (Z)-citral, nerolic acid, geranic acid and (E, E)-farnesol) that acts as an attracting signal. This pheromone is used for aggregation (during swarming). Adult worker bees also produce a substance, ethyl oleate, that has a priming effect. Ethyl oleate is produced by adult forager bees and acts as a chemical inhibitory factor to delay age at onset of foraging (the presence of older worker bees causes a delayed onset of foraging in younger individuals). Chemical cues on the surface of larvae called a brood pheromone (ethyl and methyl esters of palmitic, linoleic, linolenic, stearic, and oleic acids, E-β-ocimene) are important in the communication between brood and worker bees. This pheromone modulates the feeding behaviour of worker bees, inhibits the activation of the worker ovary, induces worker bees to cap brood cells, increases the activity of the hypopharyngeal glands of nurse bees and modulates the behavioural maturation of worker bees. © 2012 Veterinarni Medicina.","chemical communication in the honeybee (apis mellifera l.): a review","An important area of physiology of the honeybee (Apis mellifera)"

Our working hypothesis is that within specialized mutualistic interactions, where each species relies on the co-occurrence of the other for survival and/or reproduction, partners are expected to show congruent evolutionary trajectories, because they are likely to have followed parallel migration routes and to have shared glacial refugia. Location: Western Palaearctic. Methods: Our analysis relies on the extensive sampling of 104 Western Palaearctic populations (totalling 434, 159 and 74 specimens of Lysimachia vulgaris, Macropis europaea and Macropis fulvipes, respectively), genotyped with amplified fragment length polymorphism. Based on this, we evaluated the regional genetic diversity (Shannon diversity and allele rarity index) and genetic structure (assessed using structure, population networks, isolation-by-distance and spatial autocorrelation metrics) of each species. Finally, we compared the general phylogeographical patterns obtained. Results: Contrary to our expectations, the analyses revealed phylogeographical signals suggesting that the investigated organisms demonstrate independent post-glacial trajectories as well as distinct contemporaneous demographic parameters, despite their mutualistic interaction. Main conclusions: The mutualistic partners investigated here are likely to be experiencing distinct and independent evolutionary dynamics because of their contrasting life-history traits (e.g. dispersal abilities), as well as distinct hubs and migration routes. Such conditions would prevent and/or erase any signature of co-structuring of lineages in space and time.

Individually labeled undertakers, guards, food storers, and wax workers exhibited a broad range of task-related behavior, but bees tagged as undertakers were more likely to subsequently remove a corpse from the hive and handle a corpse compared to other middle-aged bees. The activity level of undertakers was similar to other task groups, suggesting that undertaking specialists were neither hyper-active 'elites' nor quiescent 'reserves' that become active only when a dead bee stimulus is present. Undertakers also were more likely to remove debris and to remain in the lower region of the hive or near the entrance, even when not engaged in corpse removal; both preferences may promote colony efficiency by reducing inter-task travel times. Guards and undertakers were less likely to perform behavior normally associated with young bees compared to food storers and wax workers. Undertakers and guards also initiated foraging at earlier ages than the other task groups. These results suggest that undertakers and guards may be slightly developmentally advanced compared to food storers and wax workers. There also was evidence for lifetime differences in behavioral preferences which could not be explained by differences in adult development. Bees tagged as undertakers were more likely to subsequently remove a dead bee during their entire pre-foraging career compared to other task groups or members of their general age cohort. Differences in both the rate of adult development and individual behavioral preferences, both of which may be subject to genetic and environmental influences, are important determinants of inter-individual variation among honey bees of middle age.","division of labor between undertaker specialists and other middle-aged workers","A primary determinant of colony organization in temporally polyethic insect"

We examine here one of the largest bee genera, the genus Megachile – the dauber and leafcutting bees. Besides presenting a phylogeny based on five nuclear genes (5480 aligned nucleotide positions), we attempt to use the phylogenetic signal of mitochondrial DNA barcodes, which are rapidly accumulating and already include a substantial proportion of the known species diversity in the genus. We used barcodes in two ways: first, to identify particularly divergent lineages and thus to guide taxon sampling in our nuclear phylogeny; second, to augment taxon sampling by combining nuclear markers (as backbone for ancient divergences) with DNA barcodes. Our results indicate that DNA barcodes bear phylogenetic signal limited to very recent divergences (3–4 my before present). Sampling within clades of very closely related species may be augmented using this technique, but our results also suggest statistically supported, but incongruent placements of some taxa. However, the addition of one single nuclear gene (LW-rhodopsin) to the DNA barcode data was enough to recover meaningful placement with high clade support values for nodes up to 15 million years old. We discuss different proposals for the generic classification of the tribe Megachilini. Finding a classification that is both in agreement with our phylogenetic hypotheses and practical in terms of diagnosability is particularly challenging as our analyses recover several well-supported clades that include morphologically heterogeneous lineages. We favour a classification that recognizes seven morphologically well-delimited genera in Megachilini: Coelioxys, Gronoceras, Heriadopsis, Matangapis, Megachile, Noteriades and Radoszkowskiana. Our results also lead to the following classification changes: the groups known as Dinavis, Neglectella, Eurymella and Phaenosarus are reestablished as valid subgenera of the genus Megachile, while the subgenus Alocanthedon is placed in synonymy with M. (Callomegachile), the subgenera Parachalicodoma and Largella with M. (Pseudomegachile), Anodonteutricharaea with M. (Paracella), Platysta with M. (Eurymella), and Grosapis and Eumegachile with M. (Megachile) (new synonymies). In addition, we use maximum likelihood reconstructions of ancestral geographic ranges to infer the origin of the tribe and reconstruct the main dispersal routes explaining the current, cosmopolitan distribution of this genus. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","comprehensive phylogeny, biogeography and new classification of the diverse bee","Classification and evolutionary studies of particularly speciose clades pose important"

Comparable studies have so far not been carried out in the Mediterranean region. The present study examines the influence of Mediterranean landscape context on the diversity and abundance of wild bees. To do this, we sampled bees in 13 sites in olive groves on Lesvos Island, Greece. Bees were assigned to five categories consisting of three body size groups (small, medium and large bees), the single most abundant bee species (Lasioglossum marginatum) and all species combined. The influence of the landscape context on bee abundance and species richness was assessed at five radii (250, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 m) from the centre of each site. We found that the abundance within bee groups was influenced differently by different landscape parameters and land covers, whereas species richness was unaffected. Generally, smaller bees' abundance was impacted by landscape parameters at smaller scales and larger bees at larger scales. The land cover that influenced bee abundance positively was olive grove, while phrygana, conifer forest, broad-leaved forest, cultivated land, rock, urban areas and sea had mostly negative or no impact. We stress the need for a holistic approach, including all land covers, when assessing the effects of landscape context on bee diversity and abundance in the Mediterranean.","influence of landscape context on the abundance and diversity of","The diversity and abundance of wild bees ensures the delivery"

The hand-selfing treatment resulted in very low seed set, which indicates that G. flavum is to a large degree self-incompatible and highlights the plant's need for insect-mediated outcrossing. We show that the presence of the invasive significantly enhanced pollen limitation, although the overall visitation rates were not reduced and that this increase is due to a reduction in honeybee visitation in the presence of the invasive resulting in reduced pollination.","the presence of the invasive plant solanum elaeagnifolium deters honeybees","Invasive plants can impact biodiversity and ecosystem functioning by displacing"

The sound and air flows generated by dancer's wing and abdominal vibrations have been implicated as important cues, but the decoding mechanisms for these dance messages are poorly understood. To understand the neural mechanisms of honey bee dance communication, we analyzed the anatomy of antenna and Johnston's organ (JO) in the pedicel of the antenna, as well as the mechanical and neural response characteristics of antenna and JO to acoustic stimuli, respectively. The honey bee JO consists of about 300-320 scolopidia connected with about 48 cuticular ""knobs"" around the circumference of the pedicel. Each scolopidium contains bipolar sensory neurons with both type I and II cilia. The mechanical sensitivities of the antennal flagellum are specifically high in response to low but not high intensity stimuli of 265-350 Hz frequencies. The structural characteristics of antenna but not JO neurons seem to be responsible for the non-linear responses of the flagellum in contrast to mosquito and fruit fly. The honey bee flagellum is a sensitive movement detector responding to 20 nm tip displacement, which is comparable to female mosquito. Furthermore, the JO neurons have the ability to preserve both frequency and temporal information of acoustic stimuli including the ""waggle dance"" sound. Intriguingly, the response of JO neurons was found to be age-dependent, demonstrating that the dance communication is only possible between aged foragers. These results suggest that the matured honey bee antennae and JO neurons are best tuned to detect 250-300 Hz sound generated during ""waggle dance"" from the distance in a dark hive, and that sufficient responses of the JO neurons are obtained by reducing the mechanical sensitivity of the flagellum in a near-field of dancer.

We studied foraging behavior of X. virginica on 14 blueberry cultivars in an experimental planting in Rhode Island, and assessed factors related to slitting frequency, and the effects of slitting on fruit set and blueberry quality. Among 14 cultivars in bloom, an average of 35% (range 16-67%) of flowers were slit in 2017, and 39% (range 20-62%) in 2018. Factors that affected the proportion of corollas slit included cultivar, anther length, flower volume, and number of days in bloom at or above 15°C. Corolla slitting did not affect fruit set. Average weight and percent soluble solids of fruit resulting from slit and non-slit corollas did not differ significantly in two early-('Bluehaven', 'Earliblue'), two mid-('Collins', 'Bluecrop'), and two late-season ('Herbert', 'Lateblue') ripening cultivars in 2017. In 2018, average fruit weight and percent soluble solids resulting from slit and non-slit flowers did not differ significantly in most cultivars, but slit corollas resulted in berries with greater mass in two cultivars, 'Bluehaven' and 'Collins'.

We developed an insecticide program risk (IPR) index to quantify the relative risk to wild bees of insecticide programs applied to blueberry fields. This was used to determine the relationship between IPR and the abundance, diversity, and richness of wild bee communities sampled during three successive flowering seasons. In 2 of 3 yr, bee abundance and species richness declined with increasing IPR. Bee diversity declined with IPR in one of 3 yr. These results indicate that wild bee communities are negatively affected by increasingly intensive chemical pest management activities in crop fields and that interyear variability in bee populations has the potential to mask such effects in short-term studies. When several wild bee species were analyzed separately, two of three solitary and one of three social blueberry-foraging species declined with increasing IPR values, suggesting that different life histories and nesting habits may help some bee populations escape the negative effects of insecticides applied after bloom. Pollinator conservation programs aimed strictly at reducing insecticide use may have varying success, depending on the biology of the target bee species. The IPR index provides a standard method to compare pest management programs for their potential effect on wild bee communities, with broad application for use in other agricultural systems.","community and species-specific responses of wild bees to insect pest","Wild bee conservation is regarded as essential for sustainable production"

In the investigated plots, we recorded 42% of all bee species reported from Poland. The attractiveness of wastelands was positively correlated with the coverage of blooming herbs, coverage of shrubs and low trees, and the area of the wasteland. An increase in isolation of the habitat patches, the percentage contribution of alien species, annuals, and low grasses (<25 cm) negatively affected the diversity of Apiformes. Considering the history of land use, we found that the bees were most attracted to wastelands resulting from extractive industry (sand and clay pits), and grassy habitats located in the suburbs, e.g. at sites grazed earlier by sheep. Wastelands in areas directly influenced by the chemical industry were the least attractive to bees. Analyses of quantitative and qualitative similarity of bees in various habitat types showed that three habitat types were the most similar to grasslands in the suburbs (the least disturbed habitats): degraded grasslands located closer to the city centre, extraction pits, and old fields. The presented results indicate that urban wastelands, including some post-industrial sites, can be important secondary habitats for wild bees. Thus, proper management of urban natural resources should cover both the formally managed areas and the so-called unproductive spaces, which have been undervalued so far.","wastelands: their attractiveness and importance for preserving the diversity of","Urban wastelands are important substitute habitats for many insect species,"

We chose traits representing all plausible drivers of recent floristic changes: climatic change (northern distribution limit, flowering time), land-use change (light requirement, response to grazing/mowing, response to soil disturbance), drainage (water requirement), acidification (pH optimum), nitrogen deposition and eutrophication (N requirement, N fixation ability, carnivory, parasitism, mycorrhizal associations), pollinator decline (mode of reproduction) and changes in CO2 levels (photosynthetic pathway). Our results suggest that climate warming and changes in land-use were the main drivers of changes in the flora during the last decades. Climate warming appeared as the most influential driver, with northern distribution limit explaining 30%–60% of the variance in the GLMM models. However, the relative importance of the drivers differed among habitat types, with grassland species being affected the most by cessation of grazing/mowing and species of ruderal habitats by on-going concentration of both agriculture and human population to the most productive soils. For wetland species, only pH optimum was significantly related to species performance, possibly an effect of the increasing humification of acidic water bodies.

While outcrossing levels have been described in crops such as rape that are wind-pollinated, or both wind- and insect-pollinated, much less is known about pollen dispersal in exclusively insect-pollinated crops. In this paper, we develop a mechanistic model for pollen movement that is based on a description of bee movement through space. Our model is a system of diffusion-based partial differential equations that we use to predict percent transgenic seed at arbitrary distances from a transgenic source under different planting scenarios. We present a two-pronged study, in which the mathematical modelling work is informed by experimental work. The latter was carried out in an apple orchard with a row of 200 transgenic source trees carrying the GUS marker gene. Fruit from neighbouring conventional trees was gathered at distances ranging from 3.5. m to 183. m, and the seeds were extracted and germinated. Percent transgenic seed at each location was determined by testing the seedlings for the presence of the GUS marker gene. We use the experimental data to validate and parameterize the model, and then run model simulations to determine expected percent transgenic seed in various linear landscapes. We find that the percent transgenic seed in neighbouring conventional trees and orchards is a function of the size of each orchard block and the distance between them. The model explicitly shows the effect of overlapping transgenic and nontransgenic pollen distributions in setting seed distributions, and also shows the value of buffer rows in reducing outcrossing levels in neighbouring crops. The model parameters can be adjusted to suit particular crops and locations, and may be useful for determining plausible distributions on transgenic seed plantings needed to allow for an adventitious presence of, for example, 0.9%. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","a mechanistic model to predict transgenic seed contamination in bee-pollinated","The adventitious presence of transgene containing seed in conventional crops"

Nest sites within the subalpine zone of N-central Nepal (above c2800 m) are occupied for a maximum of only 4 months in summer (June through September), while those within the warm-temperate zone (1200-2000 m) may be used for as long as 10 months of the year (February through November). Predation, especially by humans, serves as the impetus for some migratory movements, but a combination of poor foraging conditions and low colony stores also leads laboriosa colonies to migrate. In the steep, narrow valleys inhabited by these bees, the seasonal abundance and distribution of flora resources vary widely within short distances, and colonies need not move >10-20 km to migrate between cliff sites separated by as much as 2000 m in altitude. Late in November or early in December, Laboriosa colonies abandon their nests on the cliffs and move into the forest at altitudes below 2000 m. There they survive the cold winter months of December and January by huddling near the ground. Colonies return to the cliffs in early February to begin the yearly cycle again. -from Author","seasonal nesting cycle and migration patterns of the himalayan honey","Apis laboriosa nests in the open, high on cliffs at"

This plant inhabits the high altitudinal sub-alpine zone, which is characterized by a harsh climate, low species diversity and a short growing season. Echium wildpretii is a monocarpic perennial, producing a 2-3 m column-shaped, red-flowered, nectar-rich inflorescence. Although these floral traits have previously been suggested as being typical of ornithophilous flowers, this is the first study reporting observations of native birds (Phylloscopus collybita and Serinus canarius) in addition to insects visiting the flowers for nectar. The purposes of this study were firstly to investigate levels of visitation by native birds, native insects, and introduced honey bees. Secondly, we studied the influence of floral display (plant height and number of flowers), nearest neighbours (distance and size) and local vegetation structure on visitation rate. Finally, we discuss the evolution of ornithophily in an otherwise entomophilous plant lineage. We found that the level of bird visitation was relatively high early in the flowering season, but decreased in mid/late season, while the opposite pattern was found for introduced honey bees. For native insects, the frequency of visits was similar in early and late season. Bird visits were correlated with floral display. In the early season, visitation rates of honey bees and the two most common native bee species were correlated with size of the plant or its nearest neighbours, consistent with preference patterns for larger resource patches. Since only insects visit the flowers of other species in the Echium clade, E. wildpretii appears to have evolved from a truly insect-pollinated lineage. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

Mammillaria pectinifera is an endangered, small, globose cactus endemic to the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán region in Central Mexico. We aimed to characterize some basic aspects of its reproductive biology in three populations. We described flower morphology and anthesis, identified floral visitors, and evaluated the occurrence of spontaneous self-fertilization and the success of open pollination. Diurnal anthesis in flowers lasted about 4h/day and almost all flowers lasted only one day after opening. The analyses of variance revealed differences in flower morphology among populations. Herkogamy was positive and significantly different among populations. Field experiments revealed that open-pollinated flowers were highly successful in setting fruits and seeds. These results corroborate those reported in other Mammillaria species. Autonomous self-pollination was negligible and ineffective. Bees of the genus Ceratina were dominant among the captured flower visitors, and estimations of their maximum foraging distance indicated successful outcrossing in plants.

These studies focused at a limited range of heavy metals and highly contrasting locations, and sampling was rarely repeated over a prolonged period. In our study, the potential of honeybees to detect and monitor metal pollution was further explored by measuring the concentration in adult honeybees of a wide range of trace metals, nine of which were not studied before, at three locations in the Netherlands over a 3-month period. The specific objective of the study was to assess the spatial and temporal variation in concentration in adult honeybees of Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, Sr, Ti, V and Zn. In the period of July-September 2006, replicated samples were taken at 2-week intervals from commercial-type beehives. The metal concentration in micrograms per gram honeybee was determined by inductive coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Significant differences in concentration between sampling dates per location were found for Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn Sr, Ti and V, and significant differences in average concentration between locations were found for Co, Sr and V.

They retain this time memory for several consecutive days even in the absence of nectar rewards. Recent work has identified 2 classes of forager: ""persistent"" foragers that reconnoiter a known food source to ascertain its status and ""reticent"" foragers that apparently wait in the hive for a waggle dance confirming source availability. Surprisingly, a foraging group contains 40-90% persistent foragers, depending on experience at the source. What is the benefit in sending so many foragers to investigate a source when only a few foragers are required to reactivate the entire group? We used an agent-based software model to test the energetics underlying several different ratios of persistent and reticent individuals in the foraging group while varying 6 ecological factors: forager group size, source distance, source sucrose concentration, source availability in hours, number of days the source is known to the colony, and the rate at which new unemployed foragers appear on the dance floor. Our model demonstrates 2 primary explanations. First, a large number of persistent foragers are needed to ensure that at least some foragers will reconnoiter their source early in its availability, thus enabling the group to effectively exploit the source. Second, the cost of a reconnaissance flight is negligible compared with even a single successful foraging trip. © 2012 The Author.","energetically optimal foraging strategy is emergent property of time-keeping behavior","Forager honey bees exhibit a robust time memory, based on"

Semi-natural habitats and mass-flowering crops such as oilseed rape provide abundant floristic resources for bees. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influences of the spatial distribution of semi-natural habitats and oilseed rape fields on the abundance and the mean body size of a solitary bee in grasslands. We focused on a generalist mining bee, Andrena cineraria, that forages and reproduces during oilseed rape flowering. In 21 permanent grasslands of Eastern France, we captured 1 287 individuals (1 205 males and 82 females) and measured the body size of male individuals. The flower density in grasslands was quantified during bee captures (2016) and the landscape surrounding grasslands was characterized during two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). The influence of oilseed rape was tested through its distribution in the landscape during both the current year of bee sampling and the previous year. Bee abundance was positively influenced by the flower density in grasslands and by the area covered by oilseed rape around grasslands in the previous year. The mean body size of A. cineraria was explained by the interaction between flower density in the grassland and the distance to the nearest oilseed rape field in the current year: the flower density positively influenced the mean body size only in grasslands distant from oilseed rape. A. cineraria abundance and body size distribution were not affected by the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. The spatial distribution of oilseed rape fields (during both the current and the previous year) as well as the local density of grassland flowers drive both bee abundance and the mean value of an intraspecific trait (body size) in permanent grasslands. Space-time variations of bee abundance and mean body size in grasslands may have important ecological implications on plant pollination and on interspecific interactions between pollinators. Specifically, a competition between bee species for nesting sites might occur in oilseed rape rich landscapes, thus raising important conservation issues for bee species that do not benefit from oilseed rape resources. © 2018 Van Reeth et al.

Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with most dye transfers occurring at short distances (<15 m), and only a few long-distance events (up to 743 m). Flowers of C. erythraea are mainly visited by Syrphids (Diptera) and small bees, which are usually considered as short-distance pollen dispersers, and occasionally by bumblebees, which are usually longer-distance pollen dispersers. Small and large dye source populations differed in dye deposition patterns. The populations showed low genetic diversity, high inbreeding coefficients (F(IS)) and high genetic differentiation (F(ST)), suggesting restricted gene flow, which can be expected for an early-successional biennial species with a predominantly selfing breeding system and fluctuating population sizes. The positive relationship between recruitment rate and allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, and the absence of significant correlations between genetic variation and population size suggest seedling recruitment from the seed bank, contributing to maintain genetic diversity. Long-distance dye dispersal events indicate pollinator movements along urban forest path and road verges. These landscape elements might therefore have a potential conservation value by contributing to connectivity of early-successional species populations located in patchy open habitats.","pollen dispersal and genetic variation in an early-successional forest herb","In order to conserve forest plant species under the particularly"

We investigated pollen dispersal and fruit production in a population of Vaccinium oxycoccos, an insect-pollinated shrub, and compared the pollen dispersal pattern with a co-flowering, sympatric congener, V. uliginosum. We examined whether they share pollinators (through interspecific fluorescent dye transfers) and may differently attract pollinators, by comparing their floral colour as perceived by insects. Fluorescent dyes were mainly dispersed over short distances (80% within 40.4m (max. 94.5m) for V. oxycoccos and 3.0m (max. 141.3m) for V. uliginosum). Dye dispersal in V. oxycoccos was not significantly affected by plant area, floral display or the proximity to V. uliginosum plants. Interspecific dye transfers were observed, indicating pollinator sharing. The significantly lower dye deposition on V. oxycoccos stigmas suggests lower visitation rates by pollinators, despite higher flower density and local abundance. The spectral reflectance analysis indicates that bees are unlikely to be able to discriminate between the two species based on floral colour alone. Fruit production increased with increasing floral display, but was not affected by proximity to V. uliginosum plants. Our study highlights that fragmented populations of V. oxycoccos, when sympatric with co-flowering V. uliginosum, might incur increased competition for the shared pollinators in the case of pollination disruption, which might then reduce outcrossed seed set. © 2012 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","pollen dispersal and fruit production in vaccinium oxycoccos and comparison","Investigating plant-pollinator interactions and pollen dispersal are particularly relevant for"

Sufficient gene flow levels, leading to successful seed production, appear to be a key element in the sustainable persistence of insect-pollinated plant remnant populations. This study investigated reproductive success and pollen dispersal patterns in Centaurea jacea, an insect-pollinated hay-meadow herb, in the Brussels urban area (Belgium). Reproductive performance of urban park populations was compared with populations occurring in urban semi-natural sites. Pollen dispersal patterns were examined within and among-population patches front two urban parks using fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Urban park populations showed a higher reproductive success than those in urban semi-natural sites. Depositions of fluorescent dye particles on recipient individuals were found within populations (< 20 m), among populations within parks (over a few hundred meters) and among parks (maximal investigated distance: 2.6 km), indicating pollinator movements and a potential gene flow by pollen over relatively long distances. Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution with respect to spatial distance. The very small populations received more immigrant dye deposition when located at short distances from the source population. These findings demonstrate that urban populations do not perform worse in reproductive success than populations from agricultural landscapes, despite their small size, and can function as a network exchanging pollen. The conversion of urban park lawns into interconnected networks of ecologically managed hay meadows, allowing simultaneous flowering and seed production in many patches of target species, is to be strongly encouraged.

Small and isolated populations in particular may suffer from disrupted pollination processes. However, a species' response to fragmentation may vary according to life history traits. Understanding how pollen dispersal is shaped by population and life history traits such as mating system and clonal growth is therefore essential for assessing species' response to fragmentation. Methods - We investigated pollen dispersal using fluorescent dyes in nine Belgian populations in two regions of the distylous insect-pollinated clonal herb Menyanthes trifoliata. We examined whether overall and legitimate (i.e. between-morph) dye dispersal patterns differed between morphs and regions, and whether they were influenced by population traits (size, area, plant density, morph ratio, co-flowering species) and individual plant traits (number of flowers). Key Results - No evidence of dye transfer between adjacent populations (distant from 1.3 to 11.8 km) was found, suggesting no or very restricted between-population pollen flow. Within-population dye dispersal followed a decaying, usually leptokurtic, distribution, with most dye deposition at short distances (80% at less than 1.9-49.1 m), and a maximum distance of 336.6 m. Pins and thrums as recipients or donors did not differ in dye dispersal. Legitimate dye dispersal was not less successful than overall dispersal despite spatial clumping of the morphs. The distribution was similar or simply shifted to longer distances. The proportion of dyed stigmas was positively related to flowering population size and within-population heterospecific floristic richness, and to the number of flowers when considering legitimate dye deposition at distances <32 m. Conclusions - Our study highlights the effects of the spatial distance to dye source, population size and co-flowering floral resources, i.e. population traits related to attractiveness to pollinators, on pollen dispersal patterns.","what influences pollen dispersal in the clonal distylous menyanthes trifoliata","Background and aims - Habitat fragmentation may compromise population survival"

As the urbanisation is usually irreversible, the urban context has to be taken into account when defining appropriate management measures to sustain viable populations. Connectivity through pollen flow appears to be a key-factor for the long-term persistence of populations of insect-pollinated plant species. We investigated pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue in Lychnis flos-cuculi, an insect-pollinated wetland herb, along the Woluwe River, in Brussels urban zone (Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with particles mainly deposited on neighbouring individuals and populations. The mean distance of dye transfer was 133.6 m, with a maximal distance of 523.7 m. Dye deposition was positively related to the number of potential recipient plants when distance to dye source was held constant. This may be associated with a higher flowering plant density across the flying distance that increases attractiveness and visitation rate of pollinators, and/or with secondary dye transfer. When connected, small and large populations only differed in response to the number of potential recipients. The small isolated population received little immigrant pollen flow, but remained a dye donor. Our study demonstrates that small populations of L. flos-cucli along an urban river may still exchange pollen thanks to pollinator movements, and might therefore be regarded in management planning as potential connecting components between populations.

While oligolectic species forage on pollen from a single family of host plants, polylectic bees, such as bumblebees, collect pollen from many families of plants. These polylectic species contend with interspecific variability in essential nutrients of their host-plants but we have only a limited understanding of the way in which chemicals and chemical combinations influence bee development and feeding behaviour. In this paper, we investigated five different pollen diets (Calluna vulgaris, Cistus sp., Cytisus scoparius, Salix caprea and Sorbus aucuparia) to determine how their chemical content affected bumblebee colony development and pollen/syrup collection. Three compounds were used to characterise pollen content: polypeptides, amino acids and sterols. Several parameters were used to determine the impact of diet on micro-colonies: (i) Number and weight of larvae (total and mean weight of larvae), (ii) weight of pollen collected, (iii) pollen efficacy (total weight of larvae divided by weight of the pollen collected) and (iv) syrup collection. Our results show that pollen collection is similar regardless of chemical variation in pollen diet while syrup collection is variable. Microcolonies fed on S. aucuparia and C. scoparius pollen produced larger larvae (i.e. better mates and winter survivors) and fed less on nectar compared to the other diets. Pollen from both of these species contains 24-methylenecholesterol and high concentrations of polypeptides/total amino acids.

While the majority of phytophagous insects is highly host specific, generalist behavior is quite widespread among bees and presumably involves physiological adaptations that remain largely unexplored. However, floral visitation patterns suggest that generalist bees do not forage randomly on all available resources. While resource availability and accessibility as well as nectar composition have been widely explored, pollen chemistry could also have an impact on the range of suitable host-plants. This study focuses on particular pollen nutrients that cannot be synthesized de novo by insects but are key compounds of cell membranes and the precursor for molting process: the sterols. We compared the sterol composition of pollen from the main host-plants of three generalist bees: Anthophora plumipes, Colletes cunicularius, and Osmia cornuta, as well as one specialist bee Andrena vaga. We also analyzed the sterols of their brood cell provisions, the tissues of larvae and nonemerged females to determine which sterols are used by the different species. Our results show that sterols are not used accordingly to foraging strategy: Both the specialist species A. vaga and the generalist species C. cunicularius might metabolize a rare C27 sterol, while the two generalist species A. plumipes and O. cornuta might rather use a very common C28 sterol. Our results suggest that shared sterolic compounds among plant species could facilitate the exploitation of multiple host-plants by A. plumipes and O. cornuta whereas the generalist C. cunicularius might be more constrained due to its physiological requirements of a more uncommon dietary sterol. Our findings suggest that a bee displaying a generalist foraging behavior may sometimes hide a sterol-specialized species. This evidence challenges the hypothesis that all generalist free-living bee species are all able to develop on a wide range of different pollen types. © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, I inferred the breeding system of the subterranean termite Reticulitermes flavipes based on colony and population genetic structure as determined from microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA markers. Termites were sampled from natural wood debris from three undisturbed, forested sites in central North Carolina. In each site, two transects separated by 1 km were sampled at approximately 15-m intervals. A total of 1272 workers collected from 57 collection points were genotyped at six microsatellite loci, and mitochondrial DNA haplotype was determined for a subset of these individuals using either restriction fragment length polymorphism or sequence variation in the AT-rich region. Colonies appeared to be localized: workers from the 57 collection points represented 56 genetically distinct colonies with only a single colony occupying two collection points located 15 m apart. Genetic analysis of family structure and comparisons of estimates of F-statistics (FIT, F IC, FCT) and coefficients of relatedness (r) among nestmate workers with results of computer simulations of potential breeding systems suggested that 77% of all colonies were simple families headed by outbred monogamous pairs, whereas the remaining colonies were extended (inbred) families headed by low numbers of neotenics (about two females and one male) who were the direct offspring of the colony founders. There was no detectable isolation by distance among colonies along transects, suggesting that colony reproduction by budding is not common and that dispersal of reproductives during mating flights is not limited over this distance. Higher-level analysis of the microsatellite loci indicated weak but significant differentiation among sites (FST = 0.06), a distance of 16-38 km, and between transects within sites (FST = 0.06), a distance of 1 km. No significant differentiation at either the transect or site level was detected in the mitochondrial DNA sequence data. These results indicate that the study populations of R. flavipes have a breeding system characterized by monogamous pairs of outbred reproductives and relatively low levels of inbreeding because most colonies do not live long enough to produce neotenics, and those colonies that do generate neotenics contain an effectively small number of them.","hierarchical analysis of colony and population genetic structure of the","Termites (Isoptera) comprise a large and important group of eusocial"

Pollen is the primary source of proteins and lipids for bees, and the concentrations of these nutrients in pollen can vary widely among host-plant species. Therefore we hypothesized that foraging decisions of bumble bees are driven by both the protein and lipid content of pollen. By successively reducing environmental and floral cues, we analyzed pollen-foraging preferences of Bombus impatiens in (i) host-plant species, (ii) pollen isolated from these host-plant species, and (iii) nutritionally modified single-source pollen diets encompassing a range of protein and lipid concentrations. In our semifield experiments, B. impatiens foragers exponentially increased their foraging rates of pollen from plant species with high protein: lipid (P:L) ratios; the most preferred plant species had the highest ratio (∼4.6:1). These preferences were confirmed in cage studies where, in pairwise comparisons in the absence of other floral cues, B. impatiens workers still preferred pollen with higher P:L ratios. Finally, when presented with nutritionally modified pollen, workers were most attracted to pollen with P:L ratios of 5:1 and 10:1, but increasing the protein or lipid concentration (while leaving ratios intact) reduced attraction. Thus, macronutritional ratios appear to be a primary factor driving bee pollen-foraging behavior and may explain observed patterns of host-plant visitation across the landscape. The nutritional quality of pollen resources should be taken into consideration when designing conservation habitats supporting bee populations. © 2016, National Academy of Sciences.

Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) form annual colonies which must rapidly increase their worker populations to support rearing reproductive individuals before the end of the season. Therefore, colony growth and reproduction should be dependent on the quality and quantity of pollen resources in the surrounding landscape. Our previous research found that B.impatiens foraging preferences to different plant species were shaped by pollen protein:lipid nutritional ratios (P:L), with foragers preferring pollen species with a similar to 5:1 P:L ratio. In this study, we placed B.impatiens colonies in three different habitats (forest, forest edge, and valley) to determine whether pollen nutritional quality collected by the colonies differed between areas that may differ in resource abundance and diversity. We found that habitat did not influence the collected pollen nutritional quality, with colonies in all three habitats collecting pollen averaging a 4:1 P:L ratio. Furthermore, there was no difference in the nutritional quality of the pollen collected by colonies that successfully reared reproductives and those that did not. We found however, that nutritional intake, calculated as the colony-level intake rate of nutrient quantities (protein, lipid, and sugar), was strongly related to colony growth and reproductive output. Therefore, we conclude that B.impatiens colony performance is a function of the abundance of nutritionally appropriate floral resources in the surrounding landscape. Because we did not comprehensively evaluate the nutrition provided by the plant communities in each habitat, it remains to be determined how B.impatiens polylectic foraging strategies helps them select among the available pollen nutritional landscape in a variety of plant communities to obtain a balance of key macronutrients.","consistent pollen nutritional intake drives bumble bee (bombus impatiens) colony","Foraging behavior is a critical adaptation by insects to obtain"

Thermal investigations of the Neotropical bumblebee Bombus atratus at rest were performed by means of thermometry. Most social insects are diurnal foragers. When they are inside their nests during the night, they carry out some tasks such as cleaning the nest, brood care or nest thermoregulation. However, forager bees generally pause at night in a sleep-like state. A bumblebee nest was transferred to a brood chamber which was maintained at approximately constant temperature (28 +/- A 1 A degrees C) to prevent the workers from building the protecting involucrum so that one could mark them at birth. To provide a temperature gradient, two chambers were installed adjacent to the brood chamber, so that the workers had the chance to choose between 3 temperatures: the first one kept at 22 +/- A 1 A degrees C, the second at 19 +/- A 1 A degrees C and 28 +/- A 1 A degrees C. The temperatures of the chambers were recorded continuously by a four channel data logger. Three categories of tasks performed by workers were registered in this investigation: warming brood (task 1), feeding brood (task 2) and foragers (task 3).

The results confirm that neither the bee species nor the geographical location determine the chemical composition of Meliponinae propolis and the choice of its plant source, respectively. This could be explained by the fact that Meliponinae forage over short distances (maximum 500 m) and thus use as propolis source the first plant exudate they encounter during their flights. The antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of the samples were also investigated. Most samples had weak or no activity against E. coli, weak action against Candida albicans.

On the other hand, urban land use can potentially be beneficial to pollinators through the presence of urban gardens and parks which are usually designed to ensure abundant flowering. However, little is known about the effects of urban land use on bees and the pollination services they provide. In an urban-pen-urban gradient around Leuven, Belgium we studied flower visitation rates to, and seed set of Trifolium repens (white clover) in public lawns. T. repens is an obligatory outcrossing plant and is therefore sensitive to reductions in pollinator services. We related our results to both local and regional variables using Boosted Regression Trees. The two variables that best explained the variability in visitation rates and seed set were the amount of green areas (gardens, parks, grasslands) in the surroundings and the abundance of T. repens in the lawns. Surprisingly, an increasing amount of green areas in the surroundings had a negative effect on both flower visitation rates to, and seed set of T. repens. Flower visitation rates by bumblebees responded positively to urban land use resulting in higher visitation rates and increased seed set in the more urban sites. This may point either to increased abundance of bumblebees in more urban sites or to a concentration effect of bumblebees in our urban study sites due to a lack of alternative forage resources. Responses will likely differ for other bee and plant species, but this shows that at least for T. repens, pollination is not compromised by urban land use.

Conservation actions should be encouraged for a range of endangered Mediterranean orchid species, but the current taxonomic confusion in several genera and the apparent disagreement among orchid taxonomists make the situation particularly confusing from a conservation perspective. In this review, we document how the different pollination syndromes of Mediterranean orchids (nectar reward, shelter offering, food deception and sexual deception) can have a profound impact on the type of reproductive barriers among species, on floral phenotypic variation as we perceive it, on potentially related processes of species sorting and extinction and, consequently, should have a strong influence on the related conservation management programs. We also highlight that the majority of Mediterranean orchids are pollinated by specialised bees often occupying otherwise narrow ecological niches (e.g. pollen specialisation, brood cell parasites, specific nesting site). This condition makes the orchid-pollinator interactions very fragile and several orchid species prone to local extinction. We illustrate this phenomenon by a selection of case studies that show how the adequate integration of the ecological requirements/traits of the orchids and their associated pollinators into conservation actions could help protect endangered species and ensure the sustainability of the often complex local pollination web.","pollination syndromes in mediterranean orchids-implications for speciation, taxonomy and conservation","The Mediterranean flora is spectacularly rich in orchid species that"

This study investigates the possibility of moving actively nesting O. cornuta populations, and evaluates the effects of moving distance and nest site artificial visual landmarks on orientation and establishment of moved females. Nesting shelters with known numbers of nesting females were nocturnally relocated for distances ranging from 0 to 240 km, and the numbers of nesting females were counted after each move. Nearly all females continued to nest at shelters that were moved short (0-3 m) distances. Moves of intermediate distances (135-235 m) resulted in considerable (30-76%) bee loss (dispersal), and many females flew back to the original nesting site. At long distances (3-240 km), dispersal was higher (63-78%) and no bees were seen hovering at the original site. Moving distance was correlated positively with dispersal and with orientation (zigzagging) flights made by females when they first exited their nests after the moves. The addition or removal of supplementary visual landmarks (2 by 1.5-m banner with colored patterns) at the nesting shelter did not affect dispersal rates. Bees appeared to respond to supplementary landmarks but used other signals as primary orientation cues. An additional experiment showed that O. cornuta populations can be removed and stored at low temperature for up to 4 d (e.g., to avoid pesticide treatments) and then reinstalled at their nesting site, without affecting female orientation or nesting.","nest site orientation and relocation of populations of the orchard","Moving actively nesting populations of the orchard pollinator Osmia cornuta"

In the Prairie Pothole Region, wetland remnants are a common feature in intensively cultivated landscapes. These wetlands are typically small and often left embedded in the cropland matrix and may act as the only semi-natural feature in a radius of several hundred metres. To quantify the role that these in-field wetlands play in supporting native pollinators, we sampled bees at three distances from the wetland margin into the surrounding cropland (0 m, 25 m and 75 m) across the season in three field types (canola, cereal and perennial grassland). We used Bayesian multilevel models to test the hypothesis that native bees are using infield wetlands as habitat for nesting and foraging. Native bee abundance and diversity decreased further away from the margin of wetlands in both canola and cereal fields, while it increased in wetlands located in perennial grassland. Community composition did not change further away from wetlands, which may be because the foraging range of most species was within the sampling distance of the study. These results suggest that wetlands play an important role in providing critical resources for native pollinators, and encouraging farmers not to drain or plow through these wetlands will have beneficial impacts for native pollinators in the area. Maintaining in-field wetlands may have additional pollination benefits for farmers growing crops such as canola, which is known to benefit from insect visitors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","pothole wetlands provide reservoir habitat for native bees in prairie","The act of converting prairie grassland to agricultural farmland has"

In particular, the size of visitors, relative to flower size, may have severe implications for plant fitness, as it can affect the mechanics of the pollination process. Ononis masquillierii, a rare endemic legume in northern Italy, is visited by numerous bee species of different families and sizes. To evaluate the effect of bee guilds on seed set, we compared the relative efficiency of four size classes of bees visiting flowers in eight plant populations occurring in the Apennines. Size classes were assorted by body weight. Reproductive success was positively related to plant population size and affected by the visitation frequency of the bee size guilds: higher visitation rates by larger bees (medium-large Andrenidae and large Apidae) increased seed set, whereas high visitation rates by smaller bees (small Halictidae and small-medium Megachilidae) reduced seed set. We conclude that the influence of bee size on seed set is related to the pollen foraging techniques of the different bee guilds. Larger bees paying short visits to flowers remove one 'batch' of pollen and transfer it to another flower. In contrast, smaller bees enter the flower entirely and activate the pump-like pollen dispensing mechanism several times, resulting in a higher degree of selfing. These behaviours may result in differential seed sets as the flowers are self-incompatible, i.e. seed set may be reduced after visitation by smaller bees. Such variations in pollinator quality among populations coupled with the ephemeral nature of the habitat of O. masquillierii may represent a risk for its persistence. Our results show that such a risk can be confronted only through the conservation of large plant populations and of large bees capable of flying long-distances. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.","small-size bees reduce male fitness of the flowers of ononis","Most plant species are visited by a diverse array of"

Subsequent food-search tests indicated that bees searched much more accurately when both odometric and landmark cues were available than when only odometry was available. When the two cue sources were set in conflict, by shifting the position of the landmark in the tunnel during test, bees overwhelmingly used landmark cues rather than odometry. In another experiment, odometric cues were removed by training and testing in axially striped tunnels. The data show that bees did not weight landmarks as highly as when odometric cues were available, tending to search in the vicinity of the landmark for shorter periods. A third experiment, in which bees were trained with odometry but without a landmark, showed that a novel landmark placed anywhere in the tunnel during testing prevented bees from searching beyond the landmark location. Two further experiments, involving training bees to relatively longer distances with a goal-defining landmark, produced similar results to the initial experiment. One caveat was that, with the removal of the familiar landmark, bees tended to overshoot the training location, relative to the case where bees were trained without a landmark. Taken together, the results suggest that bees assign appropriate significance to odometric and landmark cues in a more flexible and dynamic way than previously envisaged.","interactions of visual odometry and landmark guidance during food search","How do honeybees use visual odometry and goal-defining landmarks to"

The distribution of flowering individuals within the 15-m radius had a significant positive effect on flower visitation rates. At a larger scale (35-45-m radius), an increase in density of male plants led to a decrease in visitation rates, indicating competition for pollinators. Within the smaller radius, the facilitative effect was probably induced by elevated floral advertisement and high mobility of cockroaches at this scale. Within the larger radii, the results indicated that cockroach mobility was restricted and population density was stable at this scale.

Resource partitioning was not clearly observed among a subset of late spring colonies, as two families of high richness of species and abundant in this dry forest (the mimosoid clade in Fabaceae and Capparaceae) were foraged. A higher number of synchronously sampled colonies would be necessary to detect this ecological aspect. The botanical composition of samples of M. orbignyi was governed by both random factors such as local and temporary flower availability plus preferences for particular plant species such as those from Solanaceae and Ximeniaceae.

The assessment of the diet of the stingless bee Melipona orbignyi was carried out by comparing different calculations from palynological data being the index of relative importance (IRI) the most complete, objective, and here recommended. This index showed that the order of the four most important pollen resources was Prosopis (IRI = 3354), Albizia inundata (1999), Cynophalla retusa (921), and Solanum type 2 (693), and the value of importance of species (SI) calculated for honey resources showed that they were type Maytenus (SI = 20.79), Prosopis (18.73), Cynophalla retusa (6.72), and Ziziphus mistol (3.32). Three flower types predominated in pollen and nectar provisions: brush flowers, solanoid flowers with poricidal anthers, and generalized small pale flowers, being the former two associated to buzzing. The abundance of the nectarless Solanum in honey samples is discussed. Good forest management practices for pollinator conservation native to the Chaco forest should include the keeping of undisturbed forest patches for nesting and foraging while the surrounding forest resources are managed in a sustainable way. Furthermore, because some threatened plants important for the M. orbignyi diet require gene flow to maintain healthy populations, short distances among the forest patches are needed, a fact that also helps to avoid genetic drift in Melipona colonies. The rational rearing of Melipona orbignyi would be a good practice to be implemented to promote pollination of threatened tree and shrub individuals isolated by forest fragmentation. © 2019, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","pollen diet assessment and flower association in melipona orbignyi and","Management and conservation of wild pollinators in forests of the"

Sampling was carried out in a short period of time (late winter) and located within a distance of 50 m. Pollen analysis using acetolysis showed that most identified pollen types (31) were from native species, 12 from ornamental exotic species, 5 included native and ornamental exotic species and 18 of uncertain status. A much broader pollen spectrum was present in garbage pellets (62 types) than loads (14 types). A few resources from previous blooming (late spring-summer) were identified in garbage pellets, which were mainly composed of current flowerings. From the 66 pollen types found in all samples, many (18) remained unidentified due to the complex nature of the vegetation surrounding the nests and the generalist behaviour of these bees. The versatile foraging behaviour on spontaneous (mostly native) and cultivated (mostly ornamental exotic) pollen resources is an important issue for the conservation and rearing of stingless bee colonies in urban habitats where native flora is preserved, particularly the riparians, where a high richness of blooming plants is available. © 2019, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

However, very few studies have explored bumblebee communities prior to the onset of these major land use changes, and those studies that do are mostly based on low-resolution spatial data. Here, we perform a comparative analysis based on detailed landscape composition and bumblebee occurrence records between the early twentieth century (1910-1930) and the contemporary period (2013-2015) in four localities representative of Belgium. We show that bumblebee assemblages changed drastically over this period, and that the decline in richness was strongest in areas with the greatest increase in urbanization and agricultural intensification. The one locality still retaining a high proportion of grasslands, orchards and woodlands with the smallest overall change in landscape composition still hosts a rich bumblebee fauna, very similar than in the past. We provide recommendations for land use management based on these findings. We also warn about the importance of other factors such as land use intensity, climatic conditions and altitude, which should be included in any future study addressing changes in bumblebee populations related to land use changes.","a century of local changes in bumblebee communities and landscape","Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are declining in most parts of Western"

Fieldwork was carried out in 1999 and 2000 on Mount Carmel, in northern Israel, a known hot-spot for bee diversity. Habitats with a range of post-burn ages and varying intensities of cattle grazing were surveyed by transect recording, grazing levels, and the diversity and abundance of both flowers and bees were measured. The species richness of both bees and flowers were highest at moderate to high grazing intensities, and path-analysis indicated that the effects of both grazing and fire on bee diversity were mediated mainly through changes in flower diversity, herb flowers being more important than shrubs. The abundance of bees increased with intensified grazing pressure even at the highest levels surveyed. Surprisingly though, changes in bee abundance at high grazing levels were not caused directly by changes in flower cover. The variation in bee abundance may have been due to higher numbers of solitary bees from the family Halictidae in grazed sites, where compacted ground (nesting resource) and composites (forage resource) were abundant. The effects of grazing on plants were clearest in the intermediate-aged sites, where cattle inhibited the growth of some of the dominant shrubs, creating or maintaining more open patches where light-demanding herbs could grow, thus allowing a diverse flora to develop. Overall, bee communities benefit from a relatively high level of grazing in phrygana. Although bee and flower diversity may decrease under very heavy grazing, the present levels of grazing on Mount Carmel appear to have only beneficial effects on the bee community. © OIKOS.","the effects of cattle grazing on plant-pollinator communities in a","The main aims of this study were to assess grazing"

An entire range of flower visitors of this fruit plant was captured with hand net from its field and were identified. On the basis of foraging mode, the flower visitors were characterized as pollinators and non-pollinators. Their relative abundances, foraging rates, activity durations and number of pollen grains carried on the surface were recorded and these parameters were used to determine their pollinating efficiencies. During the two years of this study, a total of 12 insect species were observed on the three varieties of plum at Hisar. Among these insect visitors, five species belonged to Hymenoptera, five to Diptera, one to Lepidoptera and one to Coleoptera. Apis dorsata was the most abundant visitor having maximal foraging rate and carried maximal number of loose pollen grains and proved to be the most efficient pollinator of plum (P. domestica) in both the seasons followed by A. mellifera, A. cerana and A. florea; the dipterans were the least efficient pollinators of plum in both the years.

Different parameters related to mouth-to-mouth food exchange (trophallaxis) showed important modulations as the offered flow of solution was incremented. Trophallactic transfer rate, i.e. the speed at which liquid food is transferred from donor to recipient bee, was found to increase along with increasing profitability at the rate feeder. In the present case, food source profitability could have been evaluated by foragers either by measuring the time invested in ingesting the solution, or by direct assessment of the flow rate of the feeder.

Two of the main characteristics that define food source profitability are the flow of solution delivered by the feeder and the time invested by the forager feeding at the source (feeding time). To investigate which of these two variables is related to unloading rate, we individually trained donor foragers to a regulated-flow feeder that presented changes in the delivered flow of solution within a single foraging bout, while feeding time remained constant. With the range of flows used, bees attained maximum crop loads in all experiments. During the subsequent trophallactic encounter with an unfed recipient hivemate, unloading rate was differentially affected by the changes in flow of solution presented during the previous foraging trip at the source, depending on whether there had been an increase or a decrease of flow rate within that visit. Foragers unloaded at lower rates when they experienced a decrease in flow rate, but did not increase the unloading rate when presented with an increase at the food source. Thus, forager honeybees seem to be able to detect variations in the delivered flow of solution, since they modulate unloading rate in relation to these changes, although decreases in food value seem to be perceptually weighted in relation to increases, independently of the time invested in the food-gathering process. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","honeybees assess changes in nectar flow within a single foraging","Forager honeybees returning to the hive after a successful foraging"

We examined natural and introduced populations of C. torelliana for 4 years to determine the species of bees that disperse seeds, and the extent and distance of seed dispersal. The mechanism of seed dispersal by bees was also investigated, including fruit traits that promote dispersal, foraging behaviour of bees at fruits, and the fate of seeds. The fruit structure of C. torelliana, with seed presented in a resin reward, is a unique trait that promotes seed dispersal by bees and often results in long-distance dispersal. We discovered that a guild of four species of stingless bees, Trigona carbonaria, T. clypearis, T. sapiens, and T. hockingsi, dispersed seeds of C. torelliana in its natural range. More than half of the nests found within 250 m of fruiting trees had evidence of seed transport. Seeds were transported minimum distances of 20-220 m by bees. Approximately 88% of seeds were dispersed by gravity but almost all fruits retained one or two seeds embedded in resin for bee dispersal. Bee foraging for resin peaked immediately after fruit opening and corresponded to a peak of seed dispersal at the hive. There were strong correlations between numbers of seeds brought in and taken out of each hive by bees (r = 0.753-0.992, P < 0.05), and germination rates were 95 ± 5%. These results showed that bee-transported seeds were effectively dispersed outside of the hive soon after release from fruits. Seed dispersal by bees is a non-standard dispersal mechanism for C. torelliana, as most seeds are dispersed by gravity before bees can enter fruits. However, many C. torelliana seeds are dispersed by bees, since seeds are retained in almost all fruits, and all of these are dispersed by bees. © 2007 The Authors.","standard yet unusual mechanisms of long-distance dispersal: seed dispersal of","Mellitochory, seed dispersal by bees, has been implicated in long-distance"

As a first step toward understanding the potential agricultural benefits of solar-pollinator habitat, we identified areas of overlap between USSE facilities and surrounding pollinator-dependent crop types in the United States (U.S.). Using spatial data on solar energy developments and crop types across the U.S., and assuming a pollinator foraging distance of 1.5 km, we identified over 3,500 km2 of agricultural land near existing and planned USSE facilities that may benefit from increased pollination services through the creation of pollinator habitat at the USSE facilities. The following five pollinator-dependent crop types accounted for over 90% of the agriculture near USSE facilities, and these could benefit most from the creation of pollinator habitat at existing and planned USSE facilities: soybeans, alfalfa, cotton, almonds, and citrus.

Most crops represent temporal foraging habitats with high abundance of bumblebees but mainly with low diversity in the bumblebee forage community, in contrast to permanent foraging habitats such as, for example, a hedgerow. The high numbers of bumblebees in the monoculture of crop plantations consisted mainly of short-tongued bumblebee species. The role of foraging distances for the visitation rate of foraging habitats was studied by performing capture-recapture experiments with natural nests of Bombus terrestris, Bombus lapidarius and Bombus muscorum. Differences were found on the species as well as the individual level. The foraging distances of B. muscorum were more restricted to the neighbourhood of the nesting habitat than the foraging activity of B. terrestris and B. lapidarius. High percentages of B. terrestris workers were recaptured while foraging on super-abundant resources in distances up to 1750 m from the nest. Isolated patches of highly rewarding forage crops, in agricultural landscapes, are probably only accessed by bumblebee species with large mean foraging distances, such as the short-tongued B. terrestris. Species like the rare, long-tongued B. muscorum depend on a close connection between nesting and foraging habitat. A restricted foraging radius might be one important factor of bumblebee species loss and potential pollinator limitation in modern agricultural landscapes. Furthermore, long-distance flights of bumblebee pollinators have to be considered in the present discussion on gene flow from transgenic plant species on a landscape scale.","foraging habitats and foraging distances of bumblebees, bombus spp. (hym.,","In selected foraging habitats of an agricultural landscape flower visits"

Accurate decisions often take longer for a given condition, while fast decisions can be inaccurate in some tasks. Speed-accuracy tactics are known to vary consistently among individuals, and show a degree of flexibility during colour discrimination tasks in bees. Such individual flexibility in speed-accuracy tactics is likely to be advantageous for animals exposed to fluctuating environments, such as changes in predation threat. We therefore test whether individual speed-accuracy tactics are fixed or flexible under different levels of predation threat in a model invertebrate, the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. The flexibility of speed-accuracy tactics in a foraging context was tested in the laboratory using a ""meadow"" of artificial flowers harbouring ""robotic"" crab spider predators. We found that while the ranking of bees along the speed and accuracy continuums was consistent across two levels of predation threat, there was some flexibility in the tactics used by individual bees - most bees became less accurate at colour discrimination when exposed to predation threat when flower types were rewarding. The relationship between decision speed and accuracy was influenced by predator detectability and the risk associated with making incorrect choices during the colour discrimination task. Predator crypsis resulted in a breakdown in the relationship between speed and accuracy, especially when making an incorrect floral choice incurred a distasteful quinine punishment. No single speed-accuracy tactic was found to be optimal in terms of foraging efficiency under either predation threat situation. However, bees that made faster decisions achieved higher nectar collection rates in predator free situations, while accurate bees achieved higher foraging rates under predation threat.

Geographic mosaic theory of coevolution (GMC) proposes that the dynamics of coevolution between pairs or group of species often occur at different geographic scales. There are three hypotheses on the coevolutionary process. (1) Different evolutionary interaction trajectories among populations are likely to generate a selection mosaic. (2) A mixture of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots. Hot spots are the subset of communities in which much of the coevolutionary change occurs and coldspots refer to areas where coevolutionary selection hardly occurs or completely does not occur. (3) There is a continual population remixing of the range of coevolving traits, resulting from the selection mosaic, coevolutionary hotspots, gene flow, random genetic drift, and local extinction of subpopulations. Studies of GMC between plants and pollinators indicate that shifts of effective pollinators among different geographic populations may cause divergence in floral traits (i.e., pollination ecotype). Changes of pollinator assemblages or species components have been illustrated coevolving with floral morphology or reward among populations from different altitudes or habitats. Here, recent case studies of GMC between plants and pollinators are grouped into five categories: Floral morphology and pollinator components, corolla tube/nectar spur and pollinator feeding structure, floral color, floral scents, floral rewards and pollinator assemblages. Floral tube or nectar spur length is positively related to pollinator body structures, such as the proboscis and leg length. The adaptation of flower color and pollinator vision provides a series of examples for the GMC. With the increase of altitude, flower color changed from blue and ultraviolet blue adapted to bee vision to blue-green and green adapted to fly vision. Recent study indicated that the difference in cycad odor components related to a shift of beetle species in different regions, suggesting a potential coevolutionary relationship between flower odor and pollinators. Studies showed that where bees foraged more nectar, flowers secreted more nectar, suggesting that floral reward amounts and types coevolve with pollinators among different geographic populations. An examination of GMC in plant-pollinator interactions involves three steps in general: (1) Detection of the relationship between floral traits and pollinator shift or body structure. (2) Transplanting experiments to detect differences in seed set between native phenotypes and transplanted phenotypes. (3) Single pollinator visit experiment to detect pollen output differences between native and transplanted phenotypes. Experimental evolutionary biology not only can test whether floral variation is related to pollinator shifts, but also make people aware of the impact of the reduction or loss of pollinators on the evolutionary consequences. To illustrate GMC between plants and pollinators, it is essential to isolate the evolutionary changes in traits caused by biotic factors or abiotic factors in future. It would be highly appreciated if genome scans and analysis are used in further studies to explore the genome-wide patterns of GMC between plants and pollinators. © 2019, Science Press.

The genetic effect of habitat fragmentation depends largely on the level of gene flow within and among population fragments. In the present study, Eurycorymbus cavaleriei, a canopy tree found throughout subtropical China, was selected as a representative insect-pollinated plant species to assess genetic consequence of forest fragmentation. Contemporary pollen dispersal and mating patterns were estimated in two physically isolated stands of E. cavaleriei within fragmented forests using six highly polymorphic microsatellite loci. We found high genetic diversity (H-E = 0.670-0.754) in both adults and offspring in the fragmented agricultural landscape, suggesting that habitat fragmentation did not necessarily erode genetic diversity of E. cavaleriei. Although substantial pollen travelled less than 100 m, paternity analysis revealed that a large amount of long-distance pollination events occurred, with the average pollen dispersal distance being 1107m and 325m for the two stands, respectively. Extensive pollen immigration (39.3-42.6%) indicated that there was effective genetic connectivity among E. cavaleriei stands in the fragmented forests. TWOGENER analysis revealed that the exponential power model was the best-fitting dispersal curve with a fat-tailed (b < 1) dispersal feature. The results from a multilocus mating system analysis suggested that a small amount of biparental inbreeding and some correlated mating events occurred in the fragmented forests, which were similar to our parallel findings in the continuous forests of E. cavaleriei. Estimates of pollen pool structure (Phi(FT) = 0.128-0.174) indicated large genetic differences between pollen clouds accepted by maternal trees. The number of effective pollen donors (N-ep) in E. cavaleriei, estimated using both MLTR (N-ep = 4.2-5.3) and TWOGENER (N-ep =2.9-3.9) models, was equivalent to the number of effective pollen donors detected in continuous forests of E. cavaleriei. The pollen dispersal and mating patterns detected here indicated that habitat fragmentation did not have a negative impact on pollen movement in E. cavaleriei, possibly due to its generalist pollination system and the resilient foraging behavior of its pollinators in response to changes in landscape structure.

Honey bees live in large eusocial colonies in which a single queen is responsible for reproduction, several thousand sterile female worker bees complete a myriad of tasks to maintain the colony, and several hundred male drones exist only to mate. The ""queen substance"" [also termed the queen retinue pheromone (QRP)] is an eight-component pheromone that maintains the queen's dominance in the colony. The main component, 9-ODA, acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting workers to the queen and as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting worker ovary development; it also acts as a sex pheromone, attracting drones during mating flights. However, the extent to which social and sexual chemical messages are shared remains unresolved. By using a custom chemosensory-specific microarray and qPCR, we identified four candidate sex pheromone Ors (AmOr10, -11, -18, and -170) from the honey bee genome based on their biased expression in drone antennae. We assayed the pheromone responsiveness of these receptors by using Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiology. AmOr11 responded specifically to 9-ODA (EC50 = 280 ± 31 nM) and not to any of the other seven QRP components, other social pheromones, or floral odors. We did not observe any responses of the other three Ors to any of the eight QRP pheromone components, suggesting 9-ODA is the only QRP component that also acts as a long-distance sex pheromone. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","a honey bee odorant receptor for the queen substance 9-oxo-2-decenoic","By using a functional genomics approach, we have identified a"

There is compelling evidence that small species are more susceptible than large species. The impact of habitat fragmentation on intraspecific body-size distribution, however, is yet unexplored. Objectives: We tested habitat fragmentation, a major driver of pollinator loss, for its impact on intraspecific body-size distributions of solitary wild-bee species. Subsequently, we tested individual body size for its impact on pollination services. Methods: We sampled 1272 individuals of the four most common Andrena wild bee species in 22 newly established flowering fields (0.21–0.41 ha) in Hessen, Central Germany, over two consecutive years. Study sites were located in a ca. 80 ha landscape context of increasing habitat fragmentation. We analysed the pollen loads of the most abundant species. Results: Body size within local populations of the two medium-sized bees increased with fragmentation, suggesting intraspecific selection for higher dispersal capacity. Pollen analysis carried out for the most common species revealed that larger individuals visited a significantly smaller plant spectrum. Habitat fragmentation may thus alter pollination services without necessarily affecting species richness or composition. Conclusions: Systematic body-size variation at the population level thus explains the considerable variability between simple community measures and ecosystem functioning. Filtering processes at the individual level require increased understanding for targeting pollination services under current and future land-use change. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","intraspecific body size increases with habitat fragmentation in wild bee","Context: In modern agricultural landscapes, fragmentation of partial habitats is"

A diverse community of bee species occurs in these apple orchards, dominated by wild bees in the families Andrenidae and Halictidae and the honey bee, Apis mellifera L. Proportion of forest area in the surrounding landscape was a significant positive predictor of wild bee abundance in orchards, with strongest effects at a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) buffer distance of 1,000 m or greater. Forest area also was positively associated with species richness, showing strongest effects at a buffer distance of 2,000 m. Nonagricultural developed land (homes, lawns, etcetera) was significantly negatively associated with species richness at buffer distances >750 m and wild bee abundance in bowl traps at all distances. Other landscape variables statistically associated with species richness or abundance of wild bees included proportion area of pasture (positive) and proportion area of roads (negative). Forest area was not associated with honey bee abundance at any buffer distance.

These tests showed that even a moderate degree of isolation (i.e. greater than 400 m) from the intact wetland habitat caused an almost complete collapse of the insect-plant interaction, at least in the short term. The number of eggs and larvae of colonising ""Batrachedra' sp., as well as average larval size and the proportion of S. ferrugineus stems damaged, all decreased logarithmically with increasing distance from the intact habitat, presumably due to dispersal limitation of the herbivore. Subsequently, to test whether the interaction can recover following habitat restoration, we surveyed herbivore colonisation rates and herbivory damage on naturally regenerated S. ferrugineus plants on experimentally restored 'islands' at increasing distances (up to 800 m) from an intact habitat. The rate of recovery of the interaction was surprisingly rapid (i.e. between 196 and 308 weeks). The degree of difference in the density of eggs and larvae, and in the proportion of stems damaged with increasing isolation from the intact wetland, gradually diminished over 196 weeks. After 308 weeks there was no significant difference in the insect-plant interaction between the intact wetland sites and any of the experimentally restored sites up to 800 m away.

We studied here one unusual element of their behavioral repertoire: ambush predation. A worker of E. ruidum waits near a nest of a social sweat bee, Lasioglossum umbripenne, lunging at incoming bees, or less frequently, at departing bees. However, bees detected ambushing ants and modified their behavior. Dead ants placed at bees' nest entrances significantly decreased bee activity, indicating that bees recognized dead ants as potential predators. Neither simple black models (square and rectangle) nor olfactory cues had any effect on overall bee activity. A returning bee usually approached her entrance and immediately entered, but if an ant was waiting at the nest, a bee was significantly more likely to abort the first approach flight and then to re-approach the nest on the side opposite the ant's position. As models became increasingly ant-like, returning bees more frequently aborted their first approach flight, expressing other behaviors before entering nests. These behaviors included withdrawal followed by an approach from a different direction; zigzagging flights, either from a distance or close to the entrance or even a close inspection; landing a short distance from the nest, then approaching on foot or waiting for several seconds before entering. Ants responded with effective counter-behaviors. Behavioral flexibility in nest entering/exiting by L. umbripenne and in hunting strategy by E. ruidum shows the complexity of this predator-prey relationship, and illustrates the importance of information processing by both species involved in determining the outcome of the interspecific interaction.","predator recognition and evasive behavior by sweat bees, lasioglossum umbripenne","Ectatomma ruidum is an abundant soil-nesting Neotropical ant, which displays"

Megachilines use resins, masticated leaves, trichomes and other plant materials sometimes along with mud to construct nests in cavities or in soil. Among these, the leafcutter bees (Megachile s.l.) are the most famous for their behaviour to line their brood cells with discs cut from various plants. We report on fossil records of one body fossil of a new non-leafcutting megachiline and of 12 leafcuttings from three European sites-Eckfeld and Messel, both in Germany (Eocene), and Menat, France (Paleocene). The excisions include the currently earliest record of probable Megachile activity and suggest the presence of such bees in the Paleocene European fauna. Comparison with extant leafcuttings permits the interpretation of a minimal number of species that produced these excisions. The wide range of size for the leafcuttings indirectly might suggest at least two species of Megachile for the fauna of Messel in addition to the other megachiline bee described here. The presence of several cuttings on most leaves from Eckfeld implies that the preferential foraging behaviour of extant Megachile arose early in megachiline evolution.

"1400","Wehner R., Michel B., Antonsen P.","visual navigation in insects: coupling of egocentric and geocentric information",1996,"Journal of Experimental Biology","","Social hymenopterans such as bees and ants are central-place foragers; they regularly depart from and return to fixed positions in their environment. In returning to the starting point of their foraging excursion or to any other point, they could resort to two fundamentally different ways of navigation by using either egocentric or geocentric systems of reference. In the first case, they would rely on information continuously collected en route (path integration, dead reckoning), i.e. integrate all angles steered and all distances covered into a mean home vector. In the second case, they are expected, at least by some authors, to use a map-based system of navigation, i.e. to obtain positional information by virtue of the spatial position they occupy within a larger environmental framework. In bees and ants, path integration employing a skylight compass is the predominant mechanism of navigation, but geocentred landmark-based information is used as well. This information is obtained while the animal is dead-reckoning and, hence, added to the vector course. For example, the image of the horizon skyline surrounding the nest entrance is retinotopically stored while the animal approaches the goal along its vector course. As shown in desert ants (genus Cataglyphis), there is neither interocular nor intraocular transfer of landmark information. Furthermore, this retinotopically fixed, and hence egocentred, neural snapshot is linked to an external (geocentred) system of reference. In this way, geocentred information might more and more complement and potentially even supersede the egocentred information provided by the path-integration system. In competition experiments, however, Cataglyphis never frees itself of its homeward-bound vector - its safety-line, so to speak - by which it is always linked to home. Vector information can also be transferred to a longer-lasting (higher-order) memory. There is no need to invoke the concept of the mental analogue of a topographic map - a metric map - assembled by the insect navigator. The flexible use of vectors, snapshots and landmark-based routes suffices to interpret the insect's behaviour. The cognitive-map approach in particular, and the representational paradigm in general, are discussed.","visual navigation in insects: coupling of egocentric and geocentric information","Social hymenopterans such as bees and ants are central-place foragers;"

While foraging individually over distances of many thousand times their body lengths in featureless as well as cluttered terrain, they navigate predominantly by visual means using vector navigation (path integration) and landmark-guidance mechanisms as well as systematic-search and target-expansion strategies as their main navigational tools. In vector navigation they employ several ways of acquiring information about directions steered (compass information) and distances covered (odometer information). In landmark guidance they rely on view-based information about visual scenes obtained at certain vantage points and combined with certain steering (motor) commands of what to do next. By exploring how these various navigational routines interact, the current position paper provides a hypothesis of what the architecture of the ant's navigational toolkit might look like. The hypothesis is built on the assumption that the toolkit consists of a number of domain-specific routines. Even though these routines are quite rigidly preordained (and get modified during the ant's lifetime by strictly task-dependent, rapid learning processes), they interact quite flexibly in various, largely context-dependent ways. However, they are not suited to provide the ant with cartographic information about the locations of places within the animal's foraging environment.

We document various factors that influence this decision: (1) learning flights reappear when experienced bees encounter a delay in finding food at a familiar place and the durations of such ""reorientation flights"" increase with the length of the delay; (2) the decay in learning flight duration over visits following such reorientation flights is more rapid than following initial discovery of the food; (3) learning flight duration increases with the visual complexity of the scene surrounding the food, and when spatial relationships among landmarks are unstable; and (4) durations of learning flights at a new feeding place are influenced by the sucrose concentration in the food. Taken together, these experiments suggest that bees can adjust their learning efforts in response to changing needs for visual information and that both sources of spatial uncertainty and the quality of the food influence the value of such information.","deciding to learn: modulation of learning flights in honeybees, apis","Upon discovering new sources of food, honeybees and other insects"

Considering its natural origin, pollen may be contaminated with pollutants due to hidden environmental factors and extensive application of pesticides. Because of their environmental persistence and prevalence in various environmental mediums, POPs can be encountered by forage bees and carried back to hives. The aim of the present study was to develop an analytical method for simultaneous determination of trace levels of 16 PAHs, 14 OCPs and 7 PCBs in bee pollen. Methods: A new method was developed using QuEChERS/GC-MS. For the initial extraction step, QuEChERS Extract Tubes based on the AOAC method for the acetate-buffered version were used. The following tubes were used for the subsequent cleanup step: dispersive tubes. Results: Recoveries of target analytes under optimized conditions ranged from 51.3% to 138.8%. Limits of detection and limits of quantification were lesser or equal to 5.8 and 19.2 mu g/kg, respectively. The correlation coefficients of 37 target analytes were higher than 0.99. This study lays the foundation for the further research into bee pollen as an environmental indicator. Conclusion: The method is simple, economical, effective and robust for simultaneous analysis of 37 kinds of POPs in bee pollen matrix. The degree of environmental pollution could be evaluated by analyzing the pollutants in bee pollen samples.

There was a broad range of capture intervals (the time required for the parent to capture a single prey) when the flight speeds predicted by the three currencies were so high that they resulted in daily provisioning costs which parents could not fully recover through self-feeding. Whenever the efficiency currency produced higher estimates of reproductive success, parents lost comparatively less weight than when they foraged as rate-maximizers. If parents did not experience any weight loss, the net rate and efficiency currencies made equivalent fitness projections. However, both of these currencies provided lower fitness returns than daily delivery rate at longer capture intervals. There were a number of capture intervals when estimates of reproductive success from the state variable model and at least one of the foraging currencies were equal. Provisioning behaviour under the state variable model was much more flexible and parents were therefore able to reduce their self-feeding rate on days when food was particularly scarce, thereby increasing the total delivery to the nest. This resulted in higher fitness returns than was possible under the foraging currencies. Our results suggest that efficiency-maximizing is more likely to provide fitness returns that are equivalent to the state variable model in comparison with the rate-maximizing alternatives, Furthermore, only the efficiency currency and the state variable model made predictions of flight speed that were similar to speeds measured in black tern parents provisioning young at natural nests.","parental provisioning in a variable environment: evaluation of three foraging","We estimated the reproductive success of black terns (Chlidonias niger)"

A pulsed sound of approximately 200 cps. which is produced during the straight run of the honey bee waggle dance is described. The presence of this sound provides a new possibility for explaining the method whereby information about the distance of the food source from the hive is communicated among bees. Besides the elements considered by von Frisch & Jander (1957), sound production time during the straight run and number of pulses present in the straight run are each shown to be also capable of carrying distance information. Since the ratio of the sound pulse rate to waggle rate is approximately 2·5 to 1, the sound is not an incidental result of waggling of the abdomen by the dancing bee. 2. 2. The complete run time, straight run sound production time, and number of sound pulses were all graphically found to be more closely related to the distance of the food source from the hive than the circle run time. These three remaining components were not found to be significantly different from each other on the basis of raw data. 3. 3. The results of a variation analysis of complete run time, straight run time, and circle run time indicate that variability of the complete run time can largely be attributed to variability of the circle run time. 4. 4. The effect of wind is greater on the straight run time than on either complete run time or circle run time. Also, that variability in the complete run time which is due to an effect of wind can largely be attributed to the effect of wind on the straight run time. This information, together with that from 3 (above), shows that the average complete run time is mainly a sum of average circle run time and average straight run time and probably does not transmit distance information in its own right. Since the average complete run time of this study must be equivalent to the average complete run time of the study of von Frisch & Jander, the complete run time of their study can also be eliminated as a possibility for transmitting distance information. 5. 5. The straight run time and number of sound pulses present in the straight run were found to be inseparable on the basis of available data. Either of these two components was found to be a better possibility for transmitting distance information than any of the other components of the dance which were covered in this study. Neither of these two components can be directly compared to the straight run waggle time or number of waggles produced during the straight run (von Frisch & Jander, 1957). Such a comparison must await further experimentation. 6. 6. The following four components (or a combination of any of these four) of the honey bee waggle dance now remain as best possibilities for conveying the information about distance of the food source from the hive: 6.1. (a) time of waggling during the straight run. 6.2. (b) number of waggles produced during the straight run. 6.3. (c) time of sound production during the straight run. 6.4. (d) number of sound pulses produced during the straight run. 7. 7. Analysis of wind effects reveals that bees signal the flight time out to the food source, not the flight time of the return trip. 8. 8. The sound pulse rate did not vary appreciably with temperature. Although the sound pulse rate did vary with distance, the amount of change was slight and the significance was marginal. 9. 9. The interpretation of the results of the step-experiments (Stüfenversuchen) of von Frisch and co-workers is questionable, since a performance much poorer than that given by the standard deviation of the results, coupled with bees visiting more than one of the unevenly spaced stations, would give similar results. 10. 10.

However, local resource partitioning does not fully explain the species diversity of bumblebee communities. Theoretical studies provide new evidence that partitioning of space can promote species coexistence, when species interact with their environment at different spatial scales. If bumblebee species possess specific foraging ranges, different spatial resource utilisation patterns might operate as an additional mechanism of coexistence in bumblebee communities. We investigated the effects of the landscape-wide availability of different resources (mass flowering crops and semi-natural habitats) on the local densities of four bumblebee species at 12 spatial scales (landscape sectors with 250-3,000 m radius) to indirectly identify the spatial scales at which the bumblebees perceive their environment. The densities of all bumblebee species were enhanced in landscapes with high proportions of mass flowering crops (mainly oilseed rape). We found the strongest effects for Bombus terrestris agg. and Bombus lapidarius at large spatial scales, implying foraging distances of 3,000 and 2,750 m, respectively. The densities of Bombus pascuorum were most strongly influenced at a medium spatial scale (1,000 m), and of Bombus pratorum (with marginal significance) at a small spatial scale (250 m). The estimated foraging ranges tended to be related to body and colony sizes, indicating that larger species travel over larger distances than smaller species, presumably enabling them to build up larger colonies through a better exploitation of food resources. We conclude that coexistence in bumblebee communities could potentially be mediated by species-specific differences in the spatial resource utilisation patterns, which should be considered in conservation schemes. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","bumblebees experience landscapes at different spatial scales: possible implications for","Coexistence in bumblebee communities has largely been investigated at local"

Instead, bumblebee densities were positively related to the availability of highly rewarding mass flowering crops (i.e. oilseed rape) in the landscape. In addition, mass flowering crops were only effective determinants of bumblebee densities when grown extensively at the landscape scale, but not at smaller local scales.

Many spiders use conspicuous body colouration to lure prey, yet the perceptual basis of such deception remains largely unknown. Here we use knowledge of visual perception in key pollinator groups (bees and flies) to test whether colour-based lures resemble floral signals. We addressed this question at two levels: first according to the spectral reflectance of Australian orb-web spiders and flowers across a broad continental range, and second in reference to polymorphic variation in the species Gasteracantha fornicata. Analysis at the community level supported the hypotheses for broad-scale convergence among spider and flower signals. Moreover, data for G. fornicata indicate that each lure morph presents a signal biased towards the colouration of sympatric flowers. This analysis identified fly- and/or bee-pollinated plants whose flowers are likely to be indistinguishable from each G. fornicata colour morph. Our findings support the hypothesis that deceptive colour-based lures exploit prey preferences for floral resources. Further, the evidence implies a greater role for specific model/mimic relationships over generalised resemblance to flower-like stimuli as a driver of lure colouration and diversity.","the perceptual similarity of orb-spider prey lures and flower colours","Receiver biases offer opportunities for the evolution of deception in"

Hymenoptera represent a special case regarding the impact of inbreeding. Haplodiploidy may permit purging of deleterious recessive alleles in haploid males, meaning inbreeding depression is reduced relative to diploid species. In contrast, the impact of inbreeding may be exacerbated in Hymenopteran species that have a single-locus complementary sex determination system, due to the production of sterile or inviable diploid males. We investigated the costs of brother-sister mating in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We compared inbred colonies that produced diploid males and inbred colonies that did not produce diploid males with outbred colonies. Mating, hibernation and colony founding took place in the laboratory. Once colonies had produced 15 offspring they were placed in the field and left to forage under natural conditions. Results: The diploid male colonies had a significantly reduced fitness compared to regular inbred and outbred colonies; they had slower growth rates in the laboratory, survived for a shorter time period under field conditions and produced significantly fewer offspring overall. No differences in success were found between non-diploid male inbred colonies and outbred colonies. Conclusion: Our data illustrate that inbreeding exacts a considerable cost in Bombus terrestris through the production of diploid males. We suggest that diploid males may act as indicators of the genetic health of populations, and that their detection could be used as an informative tool in hymenopteran conservation. We conclude that whilst haplodiploids may suffer less inbreeding depression than diploid species, they are still highly vulnerable to population fragmentation and reduced genetic diversity due to the extreme costs imposed by the production of diploid males.","impacts of inbreeding on bumblebee colony fitness under field conditions","Background: Inbreeding and the loss of genetic diversity are known"

We sampled bumble bees from ten soft fruit farms: five that deploy commercial Bombus terrestris and five that do not. Each farm was visited monthly throughout the summer and workers of B. terrestris; B. pratorum, B. pascuorum and B. lapidarius were captured. The faeces of these bees were inspected for the gut microparasites Crithidia spp., Nosema bombi and Apicystis bombi. Prevalence was defined as the proportion of individuals infected and abundance was defined as the number of pathogen cells per volume of bumble bee faeces. The prevalence of A. bombi and N. bombi was too low to analyse. The prevalence and abundance of Crithidia spp. was significantly different among bumble bee species. Overall, the prevalence of Crithidia spp. was initially lower on farms deploying commercial bumble bees, possibly due to a dilution effect caused by the high density of imported bees. Crithidia spp. prevalence in Bombus terrestris, however, rose sharply on commercial farms at the end of the season. One potential explanation is that commercial bumble bees contract the local pathogen, which is then rapidly transmitted among them due to the high bee density. Whilst our data provide no evidence of pathogen spillover to wild species, it would be premature to conclude with certainty that commercial colonies do not represent a disease risk to native bees in the UK and we urge further studies into this phenomenon.","investigating the impact of deploying commercial bombus terrestris for crop","The use of commercial bumble bees for crop pollination has"

Subjects were trained to enter a test arena where they foraged on a single, red, artificial flower that contained 140 μl of sucrose solution. Subjects were reinforced with a concentration of either 0.50 or 0.20 sucrose solution in 20 trials and in 12 subsequent test trials subjects were given a choice between a red and yellow flower that each contained 140 μl of 0.20 sucrose solution.

I used foraging tests and feeding trials to compare the ability of a generalist and a specialist solitary mason bee species to collect and develop on two pollen species that are not normally used in natural populations (novel pollens). Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) is a generalist pollen feeder; O. californica, is more specialized. Adults of the specialist were more limited in use of novel hosts, but only in some contexts. Both bee species refused to collect one novel pollen. The specialist accepted a second novel pollen only when it was presented along with its normal pollen, whereas the generalist collected novel pollen whether presented alone or with normal pollen. Surprisingly, larvae of the specialist were more flexible than were generalists. The specialist grew well on mixtures of normal and novel pollen species, in some cases better than on its normal host alone. Larvae of the generalist grew more poorly on all diets containing novel pollens than on their normal host. Data on these two species of bees suggest that specialization by itself need not reduce flexibility on novel hosts. The findings also provide information about mechanisms of specialization in bees. Similar to some folivores, specific cues of the pollen host and the bee's interpretation of these contribute, along with foraging economics, to pollen choice by adults. The ability of the larvae to cope with specific components of one pollen species need not interfere with its ability to use others.","use of novel pollen species by specialist and generalist solitary","If trade-offs between flexibility to use a range of host"

Distance weakly affected pollen use; on average, bees nesting near a flower species tended to collect more of its pollen than did bees nesting at a greater distance. Flower density did not predictably impact pollen use, and use did not track changes in density during the season. Bees consistently mixed pollen from more distant species, despite substantial added foraging costs, and also mixed when one species was an order of magnitude less abundant than the other. Bees require nectar as well as pollen to feed their offspring, and our preliminary data suggest that the efficiencies of pollen and nectar collection are inversely related between the two flower species, which would favor visitation to both species. Bees appear to collect some pollen from the low-pollen, high-nectar plant while visiting it for nectar. Thus, a nectar-collecting constraint may favor collecting pollen from mixtures of species.","consistent mixing of near and distant resources in foraging bouts","Female bees are usually confronted with a choice among several"

When tested against a null distribution using a randomization model, the observed pattern of arrivals for the whole group of bees was random, but departures were clustered in time. Certain individuals visited the plant repeatedly and frequently throughout the day. These showed significantly regular arrival and departure schedules, which were likely produced by traplining. We explored whether these more frequent and regular foragers gained a higher reward than random or incidental plant visitors. Using an analytical model, Possingham predicted that a dominating forager that visited a simple, renewing resource in a regular pattern would garner higher and less variable rewards than random visitors. Inspired by these results, but interested in plant-level visitation, we constructed a simulation model of resource dynamics for a multiflowered plant with high visitation. The model incorporates the observed visitation schedules of all bees and independent reward dynamics for each flower on the plant. We calculated the rewards that observed bees would have collected given a range of resource-renewal parameters. More frequent visitors did not return to the plant when whole-plant resource levels were higher, but these visitors did get greater rewards. Their increased reward resulted from greater foraging efficiency, primarily through selecting (on average) more rewarding flowers than those selected by less frequent, random visitors.","trapline foraging by bumble bees: iii. temporal patterns of visitation","We analyzed the temporal structure of visitation by bumble bee"

One particularly obdurate case has been the species of the subgenus Subterraneobombus. We revise the bees of this subgenus by integrating evidence from both morphology and, for a 5% subsample, from DNA (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, CO1) barcodes from pinned museum specimens. We apply a reciprocal illumination procedure: (1) taxa recognized previously from morphology are used to stratify samples for DNA subsampling; (2) DNA barcodes from these subsamples are used to recognize groups of phylogenetically related specimens; and (3) for these groups, we re-examine morphological characters in order to recognize and diagnose species. A total of 3854 specimens from 1535 samples from across the geographic range of the subgenus throughout the Holarctic and northern Oriental regions are identified to 11 species. This includes one species newly recognized from Mongolia, Bombus mongolensis Williams sp. nov. Taxon concepts are modified substantially for four species, seven lectotypes are designated, and four new synonyms are recognized. The prevailing usage of Bombus distinguendus is maintained as valid by designating Bombus elegans as a nomen oblitum and designating B. distinguendus as a nomen protectum. Identification keys and colour-pattern diagrams are provided, and geographic distributions, elevational ranges, and phenological activity periods are described to characterize the species. An estimate of the biogeographic history is reconstructed with dispersal-vicariance analysis. In this study, DNA barcode data have been a cost-effective source of additional characters for diagnosing groups of specimens. The barcode data contributed directly to recognizing the one new species, of which females remain difficult to identify from morphology alone. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.","the bumblebees of the subgenus subterraneobombus: integrating evidence from morphology","Although bumblebees have received a lot of attention, some taxonomic"

Most named taxa in this group (24 available names, from a total of 49 published names) were described originally from small differences in the colour pattern of the hair, many as parts (e.g. subspecies) of just one species. Subsequent taxonomic treatments recognised multiple species, but have described very few morphological characters, most of which are in the male genitalia. We examined 4413 specimens representing all of the named taxa from throughout the group's global range to describe variation in DNA, in skeletal morphology, and in the colour patterns of the hair. Using Bayesian inference of the phylogeny from an evolutionary model for the fast-evolving COI gene, and fitting either general mixed Yule/coalescent models or Poisson tree process models, we identify COI gene coalescents, which are expected to characterise species as evolutionarily independent lineages. None of the conditions most likely to compromise this interpretation (biased sampling, paralogy, introgression, heteroplasmy, incomplete lineage sorting) appears to be a substantial problem in this case. In an integrative analysis, we show that colour patterns are often variable within these groups and do not diagnose the same groups as we recognise from genes; in contrast, the groups recognised from gene coalescents can also be diagnosed from differences we identify in morphology. We infer that the 12 groups with coalescents in the COI gene that are corroborated by morphology constitute species, whereas many of these species are polymorphic in colour pattern. Lectotypes are designated for 15 taxa in order to reduce uncertainty in the identity and application of the names. We provide new morphological keys and distribution maps for the species. Then we use four genes (fast-evolving mitochondrial COI and 16S; and slower nuclear PEPCK and opsin) to obtain an absolute chronogram of phylogenetic relationships among the species. From published estimates that the most recent common ancestor of the subgenus Mendacibombus diverged from the other bumblebees at the beginning of the Oligocene, our results support the crown group of Mendacibombus as having diversified in the late Miocene, events that both appear to have been associated with periods of climate cooling. Relative conservatism in the alpine/subalpine climate niche of Mendacibombus, as compared with the much more diversified climate niches in the sister group of all other bumblebees, may have contributed to constraining the number of Mendacibombus species to just one twentieth of the total number of extant bumblebee species.

For Mendacibombus bumblebees, high-elevation specialists with distributions centred on the QTP, we examine broader explanations. We extend integrative biogeography to cover multiple contributing factors by using a framework of sequential filters: 1) molecular evidence from four genes is used to estimate phylogenetic relationships, with time calibration from a published estimate; 2) spatial evidence from current distributions is combined with the phylogeny and constrained by a model of short-distance dispersal along mountain corridors to estimate ancestral distributions by both S-DIVA and S-DEC analysis; 3) geological evidence from the literature is used to constrain when high mountain ranges were uplifted to become potential corridors; and 4) climatological evidence from Mendacibombus niche-evolution reconstructions and from palaeoclimate simulations is used to constrain when habitat was suitable in key gaps within corridors. Explanations for Mendacibombus distributions can be identified that require only short-distance dispersal along mountain corridors, commensurate with the limited dispersal ability observed for bumblebees. These explanations depend on the timing of uplift of mountain ranges, regional climate change, and climate-niche evolution. The uplift of the QTP may have contributed to the initial Oligocene divergence of the common ancestor of Mendacibombus from other bumblebees, but for the first two thirds of the history of Mendacibombus, only a single lineage has present-day descendants. Divergence of multiple extant Mendacibombus lineages coincided with the Late Miocene–Pliocene uplift of externally connecting mountains, combined with regional climate cooling. These changes provided greater connectivity of suitable habitat, allowing these bumblebees to disperse out of the western QTP via new high bridges, escaping along the mountain corridors of the Tian Shan and Hindu Kush ranges, reaching eventually far to the west (Iberian Peninsula) and to the north-east (Kamchatka). © 2017 The Authors","bumblebees take the high road: climatically integrative biogeography shows that","Many claims that uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (QTP) drove"

However, D. barbeyi has multiple, large inflorescences while D. nuttallianum has a single, small inflorescence. These differences in floral display should result in greater intraplant pollen transfer in D. barbeyi, leading to higher rates of self-pollination through geitonogamy. Reduced gene flow by pollen should in turn produce greater population differentiation among populations of D. barbeyi relative to D. nuttallianum. We tested these predictions by comparing pollinator behavior, breeding systems, outcrossing rates, and population genetic structure of sympatric populations of the two species in Colorado. Bumble bee and hummingbird pollinators visit more flowers and inflorescences per foraging bout in D. barbeyi than in D. nuttallianum. The species differed in breeding system; D. barbeyi produced more seeds by autogamy (9 vs. 2%) than D. nuttallianum and suffered no reduction in seed set in hand-self vs. outcross pollinations, in contrast to a 41% decline in D. nuttallianum. The outcrossing rate in one D. barbeyi population was 55%, but ranged from 87 to 97% in four D. nuttallianum populations. Genetic differentiation among population subdivisions estimated by hierarchical F statistics was > 10 times greater in D. barbeyi (<(<theta>)over cap> = 0.055-0.126) than D. nuttallianum (<(<theta>)over cap> = 0.004-0.009) at spatial scales ranging from metres to 3.5 km. Spatial autocorrelation analysis also indicated more pronounced local genetic structure in D. barbeyi than D. nuttallianum populations. Fixation indices (F-IS) of D. barbeyi adults were much lower than expected based on mating system equilibrium and suggest that differences in the degree of self-compatibility and/or the timing of postpollination selection/inbreeding depression between the two species further contribute to the genetic differences between them.","pollination, breeding system, and genetic structure in two sympatric delphinium","Two sympatric Delphinium species, D. barbeyi and D. nuttallianum, are"

In addition, we examine the role the pollination system plays in determining the reproductive success of the male steriles. Seventeen populations in Maryland, Illinois, and Kansas were surveyed and found to range from 0 to 6% male sterility per population. An artificial population of male-sterile simulants and hermaphrodites was created to examine how the local frequency of nonrewarding male steriles might affect male-sterile female reproductive success. Male steriles performed equally poorly, with respect to seed production, whether surrounded by other male-sterile simulants or hermaphrodites. Compensation was examined by comparison of male steriles and hermaphrodites with respect to several reproductive and nonreproductive characters. Male steriles outperformed hermaphrodites in terms of nonreproductive biomass, but performed equally in terms of ovule number and produced many fewer flowers. The genetic basis of male sterility was examined by performing both intra- and interpopulational crosses of male steriles to hermaphrodites and indicate that male sterility is not purely cytoplasmic. The low frequency of male sterility in C. fasciculata populations may reflect reduced female reproductive success because of pollinator avoidance, lack of reproductive compensation, and a mode of inheritance that is not purely cytoplasmic.","ecological and genetic factors contributing to the low frequency of","Bumble bee pollinated Chamaecrista fasciculata provides pollen as the sole"

Responses are often variable among species within groups making general predictions difficult. One option is to include ecological trait information that might help to disentangle patterns of response and also provide greater understanding of how particular traits link whole clades to their environment. Although this ""trait-guild"" approach has been used for single disturbances, the importance of particular traits on general responses to multiple disturbances has not been explored. We used a mixed model analysis of 19 data sets from throughout the world to test the effect of ecological and life-history traits on the responses of bee species to different types of anthropogenic environmental change. These changes included habitat loss, fragmentation, agricultural intensification, pesticides and fire. Individual traits significantly affected bee species responses to different disturbances and several traits were broadly predictive among multiple disturbances. The location of nests - above vs. below ground - significantly affected response to habitat loss, agricultural intensification, tillage regime (within agriculture) and fire. Species that nested above ground were on average more negatively affected by isolation from natural habitat and intensive agricultural land use than were species nesting below ground. In contrast below-ground-nesting species were more negatively affected by tilling than were above-ground nesters. The response of different nesting guilds to fire depended on the time since the burn. Social bee species were more strongly affected by isolation from natural habitat and pesticides than were solitary bee species. Surprisingly, body size did not consistently affect species responses, despite its importance in determining many aspects of individuals' interaction with their environment. Although synergistic interactions among traits remain to be explored, individual traits can be useful in predicting and understanding responses of related species to global change.

One such attribute is resource distribution. Organisms' reliance on resources from within a local patch vs. those found among habitats throughout the landscape will depend on local habitat quality, patch quality, and landscape composition. The ability of individuals to move among complementary habitat types to obtain various resources may be a critical mechanism underlying the dynamics of animal populations and ultimately the level of biodiversity at different spatial scales. We examined the effects that local habitat type and landscape composition had on offspring production and survival of the solitary bee Osmia lignaria in an agri-natural landscape in California (USA). Female bees were placed on farms that did not use pesticides (organic farms), on farms that did use pesticides (conventional farms), or in seminatural riparian habitats. We identified pollens collected by bees nesting in different habitat types and matched these to pollens of flowering plants from throughout the landscape. These data enabled us to determine the importance of different plant species and habitat types in providing food for offspring, and how this importance changed with landscape and local nesting-site characteristics. We found that increasing isolation from natural habitat significantly decreased offspring production and survival for bees nesting at conventional farms, had weaker effects on bees in patches of seminatural habitat, and had little impact on those at organic farm sites. Pollen sampled from nests showed that females nesting in both farm and seminatural habitats relied on pollen from principally native plant species growing in seminatural habitat. Thus connectivity among habitats was critical for offspring production. Females nesting on organic farms were buffered to isolation effects by switching to. oral resources growing at the farm site when seminatural areas were too distant. Overall local habitat conditions (farm management practices) can help bolster pollinators, but maintaining functional connectivity among habitats will likely be critical for persistence of pollinator populations as natural habitats are increasingly fragmented by human activities.","resource distributions among habitats determine solitary bee offspring production in","Within mosaic landscapes, many organisms depend on attributes of the"

Few studies, however, have directly assessed the spatiotemporal variation in resource availability that arises from landscape pattern, or its effect on populations and population dynamic parameters. We tested the effect of floral resource availability at the landscape scale on the numbers of worker, male, and queen offspring produced by bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, colonies experimentally placed within complex agricultural-natural landscapes. We quantified flower densities in all land use types at different times of the season and then used these data to calculate spatially explicit estimates of floral resources surrounding each colony. Floral availability strongly correlated with landscape structure, and different regions of the landscape showed distinct seasonal patterns of floral availability. The floral resources available in the landscape surrounding a colony positively affected the number of workers and males it produced. Production was more sensitive to early- than to later-season resources. Floral resources did not significantly affect queen production despite a strong correlation between worker number and queen number among colonies. No landscape produced high floral resources during both the early and late season, and seasonal consistency is likely required for greater queen production. Floral resources are important determinants of colony growth and likely affect the pollination services provided by bumble bees at a landscape scale. Spatiotemporal variation in floral resources across the landscape precludes a simple relationship between resources and reproductive success as measured by queens, but nonetheless likely influences the total abundance of bumble bees in our study region.","landscape-scale resources promote colony growth but not reproductive performance of","Variation in the availability of food resources over space and"

Provision of sufficient forage resources is a key element for promoting bee populations within human impacted landscapes, particularly those in agricultural lands where demand for pollination service is high and land use and management practices have reduced available flowering resources. Recent government incentives in North America and Europe support the planting of wildflowers to benefit pollinators; surprisingly, in North America there has been almost no rigorous testing of the performance of wildflower mixes, or their ability to support wild bee abundance and diversity. We tested different wildflower mixes in a spatially replicated, multiyear study in three regions of North America where production of pollinator-dependent crops is high: Florida, Michigan, and California. In each region, we quantified flowering among wildflower mixes composed of annual and perennial species, and with high and low relative diversity. We measured the abundance and species richness of wild bees, honey bees, and syrphid flies at each mix over two seasons. In each region, some but not all wildflower mixes provided significantly greater floral display area than unmanaged weedy control plots. Mixes also attracted greater abundance and richness of wild bees, although the identity of best mixes varied among regions. By partitioning floral display size from mix identity we show the importance of display size for attracting abundant and diverse wild bees. Season-long monitoring also revealed that designing mixes to provide continuous bloom throughout the growing season is critical to supporting the greatest pollinator species richness. Contrary to expectation, perennials bloomed in their first season, and complementarity in attraction of pollinators among annuals and perennials suggests that inclusion of functionally diverse species may provide the greatest benefit. Wildflower mixes may be particularly important for providing resources for some taxa, such as bumble bees, which are known to be in decline in several regions of North America. No mix consistently attained the full diversity that was planted. Further study is needed on how to achieve the desired floral display and diversity from seed mixes.","native wildflower plantings support wild bee abundance and diversity in","Global trends in pollinator-dependent crops have raised awareness of the"

Many use changing signals as indicators that visitation and/or pollination have occurred [2, 3]). Floral color change is commonly used to transmit this information [3-7] (often correlated with reduced nectar reward [8, 9]) and can be specifically triggered by pollination or visitation. By retaining color-changed flowers, plants benefit from larger floral displays but also indicate at close range which flowers are still rewarding (and still unpollinated), so that visitors forage more efficiently [5, 6]. However, the legume Desmodium setigerum shows a unique ability, if inadequately pollinated, to reverse its flowers' color and shape changes. Single visits by bees mechanically depress the keel and expose stigma and anthers (termed ""tripping""); visits also initiate a rapid color change from lilac to white and turquoise and a slower morphological change, the upper petal folding downwards over the reproductive parts. But flowers receiving insufficient pollen can partially reopen, re-exposing the stigma, with a further color change to deeper turquoise and/or lilac. Thus, most flowers achieve pollination from one bee visit, but those with inadequate pollen receipt can reverse their signals, earning a ""second chance"" by eliciting attention from other potential pollinators. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The behaviour and activity patterns of Apis mellifera and of five species of Bombus were analysed in relation to climatic variables and nectar quality on three varieties of unsprayed cultivated raspberry (Rubus idaeus) in eastern Scotland. Stages of floral morphology and reward were similar for the three varieties: young flowers offered both nectar and pollen, but medium and old flowers offered nectar only, in diminishing quantities. A wide range of insects visited raspberry flowers, but bees were dominant, bumblebees being responsible for about 60% of all visits and honeybees making up most of the remaining percentage. All bees had substantial pollen deposited on their bodies during visits, though few specifically collected it. Bombus spp. were found to favour young (receptive) flowers strongly, especially early in the morning when pollen was most abundant: whilst Apis visited unselectively. Bumblebees also foraged over substantially longer periods of the day, and in poorer weather, some being present at most times of observation; and they foraged more quickly in terms of flower visits per minute. Bombus carried more pollen on their bodies than Apis, and also deposited more pollen on raspberry stigmas, with B.lapidarius and B.terrestris being particularly effective and also being the most abundant species. All bumblebees also foraged over a longer range, moving between canes and rows more frequently than did honeybees. Bumblebees are therefore likely to be substantially more important as pollinators of raspberries than are honeybees, especially as raspberries though moderately self‐fertile may exhibit metaxenia. Reasons why Bombus may be the preferred pollinator in most sites of raspberry cultivation are discussed, together with implications for present and future growers. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

We identified pollen DNA from the crops (internal storage organs) of 21 Hylaeus specimens stored in ethanol for up to 3 years. Genetic analyses reveal high fidelity in pollen foraging despite the availability of pollen from multiple plant species present at each study site. At high elevations in Haleakala, pollen was available from more than 12 species of flowering plants, but Hawaiian silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp. macrocephalum) comprised 86% of all pollen samples removed from bee crops. At lower elevations in both parks, we only detected pukiawe (Leptecophylla (Styphelia) tameiameiae) pollen in Hylaeus crops despite the presence of other plant species in flower during our study. Furthermore, 100% of Hylaeus crops from which we successfully identified pollen contained native plant pollen. The molecular approaches developed in this study provide species-level information about floral visitation of Hawaiian Hylaeus that does not require specialized palynological expertise needed for high-throughput visual pollen identification.

To assess success in restoring not only biodiversity, but also functionality of communities, we should take into account the re-assembly of species trait composition across taxa. Attaining such functional restoration would depend on the landscape context, vegetation structure, and time since restoration. We assessed how trait composition of plant and pollinator (bee and hoverfly) communities differ between abandoned, restored (formerly abandoned) or continuously grazed (intact) semi-natural pastures. In restored pastures, we also explored trait composition in relation to landscape context, vegetation structure, and pasture management history. Abandoned pastures differed from intact and restored pastures in trait composition of plant communities, and as expected, had lower abundances of species with traits associated with grazing adaptations. Further, plant trait composition in restored pastures became increasingly similar to that in intact pastures with increasing time since restoration. On the contrary, the trait composition of pollinator communities in both abandoned and restored pastures remained similar to intact pastures. The trait composition for both bees and hoverflies was influenced by flower abundance and, for bees, by connectivity to other intact grasslands in the landscape. The divergent responses across organism groups appeared to be mainly related to the limited dispersal ability and long individual life span in plants, the high mobility of pollinators, and the dependency of semi-natural habitat for bees. Our results, encompassing restoration effects on trait composition for multiple taxa along a gradient in both time (time since restoration) and space (connectivity), reveal how interacting communities of plants and pollinators are shaped by different trait–environmental relationships.

However, the effects of organic farming on honeybees remain elusive, despite honeybees’ importance as pollinators of crops and wild plants. Using 6 years of data from a large-scale study with fortnightly measurements of honeybee colony performance traits (10 apiaries per year distributed across a 435 km2-large research site in France), we related worker brood area, number of adult bees and honey reserves to the proportions of organic farmland in the surroundings of the hives at two spatial scales (300 m and 1,500 m). We found evidence that, at the local scale, organic farming increased both worker brood production and number of adult bees in the period of flower scarcity between the blooms of oilseed rape and sunflower (hereafter ‘dearth period’). At the landscape scale, organic farming increased honey reserves during the dearth period and at the beginning of the sunflower bloom. The results suggest that worker brood development benefitted from organic farming mostly through a more diverse diet due to an increase in the availability of diverse pollen sources in close proximity of their hives. Reduced pesticide drift may have additionally improved bee survival. Honey reserves were possibly mostly affected by increased availability of melliferous flowers in foraging distance. Synthesis and applications. Organic farming increases honeybee colony performance in a period of resource scarcity, likely through a continuous supply of floral resources including weeds, cover crops and semi-natural elements. We demonstrate how worker brood area increases in the critical dearth period (between the blooms of oilseed rape and sunflower). This has previously been linked to winter colony survival, suggesting that organic farmland may mitigate repercussions of intensive farming on colony vitality.

Here we examine the recently demonstrated pedometer function in more detail. By manipulating leg lengths in foraging desert ants we could also change their stride lengths. Ants with elongated legs ('stilts') or shortened legs ('stumps') take larger or shorter strides, respectively, and misgauge travel distance. Travel distance is overestimated by experimental animals walking on stilts, and underestimated by animals walking on stumps - strongly indicative of stride integrator function in distance measurement. High-speed video analysis was used to examine the actual changes in stride length, stride frequency and walking speed caused by the manipulations of leg length. Unexpectedly, quantitative characteristics of walking behaviour remained almost unaffected by imposed changes in leg length, demonstrating remarkable robustness of leg coordination and walking performance. These data further allowed normalisation of homing distances displayed by manipulated animals with regard to scaling and speed effects. The predicted changes in homing distance are in quantitative agreement with the experimental data, further supporting the pedometer hypothesis.","the desert ant odometer: a stride integrator that accounts for","Desert ants, Cataglyphis, use path integration as a major means"

We tried to impair stride integration by amputating two of the six walking legs.

Community composition and daily foraging patterns of bees visiting flowering urban T. stans resources were outlined and compared over a 21-month period from July 2007 to March 2009. A total of 27 species were identified as foragers, accounting for over 10% of the known diversity from nearby wildlands. These bees were in the families Apidae and Halictidae and represented diverse feeding and nesting habits, as well as social and solitary life histories. Centris eurypatana Snelling, Ancyloscelis sp. 1, and Nannotriogna perilampoides (Cresson) were the dominant species collected and accounted for nearly 75% of all records. Clear daily phenology was evident, with peak visitation occurring before 1300h. Common visitors can be sorted into early morning or full day foragers represented by Xylocopa and Halictus species, respectively.

This study examined the visitation rates and foraging patterns of eight taxonomic groups of bees that are common to California poppies, Eschscholzia californica, in both landscape types. Bee occurrence was documented in relation to floral resource characteristics (patch area, poppy coverage, and poppy density), local landscape characteristics (distance to the wildland-urban interface, distance to riparian areas, distance to green space, and land use), and regional landscape context (urban versus wildland). Similar abundance and richness measures were recorded at both urban and wildland poppy patches, but community composition varied in each landscape. Bumble bees were more abundant at poppies in the wildland whereas species in the family Halictidae (sweat bees) were more abundant at poppies within the urban landscape. Resource patch size and density consistently correlated with increased bee presence for all bee types foraging in the wildland. Individual patterns of occurrence in the urban landscape were somewhat divergent; the foraging dynamics of larger bodied-bees (Bombus vosnesenskii and Megachile species) correlated significantly with resource patch size and density, whereas smaller-bodied bees (family Halictidae and Andrena species) were influenced by landscape characteristics such as distance to the wildland-urban interface and distance to riparian areas. In summary, the surrounding landscape had an influence on community composition, but the magnitude of the floral resource present at a site and factors relating to foraging energetics were dominant drivers of local occurrence.

Bumblebees provide a useful model system to explore how different lifestyles are reflected in learning abilities, because their (female but sterile) workers and males engage in fundamentally different behaviour routines. Bumblebee males, like workers, embark on active flower foraging but in contrast to workers they have to trade off their feeding with mate search, potentially affecting their abilities to learn and utilize floral cues efficiently during foraging. We used a serial colour-learning task with freely flying males and workers to compare their ability to flexibly learn visual floral cues with reward in a foraging scenario that changed over time. Male bumblebees did not differ from workers in both their learning speed and their ability to overcome previously acquired associations, when these ceased to predict reward. In all foraging tasks we found a significant improvement in choice accuracy in both sexes over the course of the training. In both sexes, the characteristics of the foraging performance depended largely on the colour difference of the two presented feeder types. Large colour distances entailed fast and reliable learning of the rewarding feeders whereas choice accuracy on highly similar colours improved significantly more slowly. Conversely, switching from a learned feeder type to a novel one was fastest for similar feeder colours and slow for highly different ones. Overall, we show that behavioural sex dimorphism in bumblebees did not affect their learning abilities beyond the mating context. We discuss the possible drivers and limitations shaping the foraging abilities of males and workers and implications for pollination ecology. We also suggest stingless male bumblebees as an advantageous alternative model system for the study of pollinator cognition. © 2015 The Authors.","male bumblebees, bombus terrestris, perform equally well as workers in","The learning capacities of males and females may differ with"

We found that the majority of the males in a 1000 m 2 sampling area originated from colonies located outside of the workers foraging range, which was consistent with the genetic distances among colonies. The analyses of temporal population sub-structure based on both colony detection rate over time and the clustering software STRUCTURE consistently suggested one large and temporally unstructured male population. Our results indicate an extended male flight distance for both species. Though the range of queen dispersal remains to be studied, the effective size (N e) of bumblebees is increased by extended male mating flight ranges (A m) exceeding worker foraging distance by factor 1.66 (A m = 69.75 km 2) and 1.74 (A m = 13.41 km 2), B. terrestris and B. lapidarius, respectively.

We used the doubly labelled water technique which makes it possible to estimate energetic costs of free flight in a natural environment. One study was carried out in windy weather in the open, the second in a large greenhouse under controlled conditions. Individual mass-specific metabolic rates from the open-air study varied widely (159.5 to 750.2 W kg-1 n = 7) and differed significantly from expected values predicted from laboratory data. Results from the greenhouse study were closer to expectations and the range of individual metabolic rates was much narrower (405.0 to 485.5 W kg-1; n = 8). The range of field metabolic rates was three to four times larger than that of laboratory studies (Heinrich, 1975; Ellington et al., 1990; Cooper, 1993), which might reflect the fact that only a relatively small percentage (25-30%) of bees are 'co-operative' in laboratory flight cost measurements (Hanauer-Thieser and Nachtigall, 1995; C.P. Ellington and T.J. Wolf, pers. observations). However, all bees flew in the field studies, even in strong winds. We conclude that estimates of energetic costs of free flight using laboratory data (time/activity/laboratory = TAL), an approach regularly used in tests of foraging models, might not be appropriate under many natural conditions.

In the downwind area, the ants pick up the odor plume emanating from the food and follow it upwind to the prey. This strategy saves considerable walking distance and time. The additional path necessitated by the downwind strategy is only about 0.75 to 2 m, depending on nest-feeder distance, while missing the food on the upwind side results in much longer search trajectories. During the initial three to five visits to a feeding site, downwind distance and length of the approach path are shortened notably, and the approach trajectory is straightened. Desert ants further exhibit considerable short-term flexibility in their approach. Experienced individuals are evidently able to decide upon leaving the nest which direction to choose toward the feeder, depending on current wind direction (that fluctuates slightly during the day). Notable changes in wind direction occur primarily overnight. For larger nest-feeder distances, the animals adjust their approach en route to the altered wind direction during their first foraging trip in the morning.","desert ants adjust their approach to a foraging site according","In the habitat of desert ants, Cataglyphis fortis, a constant"

Population subdivision was evident from cluster analysis, and an analysis of genetic distances showed that there was significant genetic differentiation between all subpopulations.

This unique foraging behaviour has been computationally realized as an algorithmic tool named the Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) algorithm to solve different types of Combinatorial Optimization Problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In order to enhance the performance of the BCO algorithm, it is integrated with a local optimization approach and a pruning strategy named as the Frequency-based Pruning Strategy (FBPS), which allows a subset of bees to undergo the local optimization and hence reduces the high processing overhead of the local optimization. Although the local optimization and the FBPS enhance the performance of the BCO algorithm, the FBPS becomes not scalable when building blocks in various sizes are considered in its pruning operation. This paper proposes a pruning strategy which employs the bi-directional extension (BIDE) based frequent closed pattern mining algorithm. It is named as the Frequent-closed-pattern-based Pruning Strategy (FCPBPS). The FCPBPS consists of two major operations: solutions accumulation and pruning operation. Solutions generated by bees are accumulated throughout the BCO algorithm execution. Based on the accumulated solutions, a set of frequent closed patterns in various sizes is mined using the BIDE algorithm. This set of frequent closed patterns is used in the FCPBPS pruning operation such that only relatively better bees (i.e. bees that produce solution which contains many of these frequent closed patterns) are allowed to undergo the local optimization. A total of 18 selected symmetric TSP benchmark problems range from 318 cities to 1291 cities are used as the testbed of this research. On average, the experimental results show that the FCPBPS requires 20.2% lesser computational time compared to the FBPS, to yield similar best-so-far TSP tour lengths. © 2015 IEEE.","a bee colony optimization algorithm with frequent-closed-pattern-based pruning strategy for","Bees perform waggle dance in order to communicate the information"

One explanation as to why some species have declined, based primarily on studies of the European bumble bee fauna, is that declining species have relatively narrow pollen-foraging niches and are less able to use alternative host plants in the absence of their preferred hosts. Though extensively explored in Europe, this hypothesis has not been investigated in North America, in part due to incomplete information on the foraging niche of many species. We selected 12 bumble bee species found in Michigan and quantified their pollen diets using museum specimens. We also extensively resurveyed the state to understand their contemporary status and distribution. Compared to a pre-2000 baseline, six species remain relatively common and widespread, whereas six species show range contractions of over 50%. There was a significant relationship between dietary breadth and distributional range change, with declined or declining species collecting around one-third fewer pollen types than stable species. Though there were significant compositional differences, we found no differences in the number of pollen types collected by species with differing tongue lengths. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that species with narrower dietary niches are at greater risk of decline. However, it is not clear if narrow dietary niches are a cause of declines, or if both are driven by an underlying factor such as proximity to the edge of climatic niches. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of dietary niche in bumble bees, and how it interacts with other factors to influence population trajectories of stable and at-risk species. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","narrow pollen diets are associated with declining midwestern bumble bee","Many species of bumble bee (Bombus) have declined in range"

Concerns at these declines have led to the development of flower-rich agri-environment schemes as a way to enhance bee diversity and abundance. Whilst the effect of these schemes on bumblebee species (Bombus spp.) has been well studied, their impact on the wider bee community is poorly understood. We used direct observations of foraging bees and pollen load analysis to quantify the relative contribution that sown flowers (i.e. those included in agri-environment scheme seed mixes) make to the pollen diets of wild solitary bees on Higher Level Stewardship farms (HLS) implementing pollinator-focused schemes and on Entry Level Stewardship farms (ELS) without such schemes in southern England, UK. HLS management significantly increased floral abundance, and as the abundance of sown flowers increased, these sown plants were utilized for pollen by a greater proportion of the solitary bee species present. However, the overall proportion of pollen collected from sown plants was low for both direct observations (27·0%) and pollen load analysis (23·3%). At most only 25 of the 72 observed species of solitary bee (34·7%) were recorded utilizing sown plants to a meaningful degree. The majority of solitary bee species did not collect pollen from flower species sown for pollinators. Total bee species richness was significantly associated with plant species richness, but there was no difference in the total species richness of either bee or flowering plant species between HLS and ELS farms. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that the majority of solitary bee species present on farmland in the south-east of England collect most of their pollen from plants that persist unaided in the wider environment, and not from those included in agri-environment schemes focused on pollinators.

In the current work we assessed whether farms implementing flower-rich schemes had richer aculeate communities than farms without such habitats. A total of 104 species of bee and 44 species of aculeate wasp were recorded. Farms providing flower-rich habitats had significantly greater floral abundance but there were no differences in the total number of aculeate or flowering plant species recorded compared to farms without these habitats. After accounting for differences in sample size, and contrary to expectations, farms without flower-rich habitats were significantly richer in aculeate and flowering plant species. Bumblebees (.

Functional diversity represents the value and range of morphological and behavioural traits that support ecosystem services. We modelled the rate at which functional diversity collapsed in response to species extinctions to provide an index of functional redundancy. Deficits in functional diversity for both pest control and pollination were found in areas of high arable crop production. Ground beetle functional redundancy was positively correlated with the landscape cover of semi-natural habitats where extinctions were ordered by body size and dispersal ability. For bees, functional redundancy showed a weak positive correlation with semi-natural habitat cover where species extinctions were ordered by feeding specialization. Synthesis and applications.

Management of lowland mesotrophic grasslands in north-west Europe often makes use of inorganic fertilizers, high stocking densities and silage-based forage systems to maximize productivity. The impact of these practices has resulted in a simplification of the plant community combined with wide-scale declines in the species richness of grassland invertebrates. We aim to identify how field margin management can be used to promote invertebrate diversity across a suite of functionally diverse taxa (beetles, planthoppers, true bugs, butterflies, bumblebees and spiders). 2. Using an information theoretic approach we identify the impacts of management (cattle grazing, cutting and inorganic fertilizer) and plant community composition (forb species richness, grass species richness and sward architecture) on invertebrate species richness and body size. As many of these management practices are common to grassland systems throughout the world, understanding invertebrate responses to them is important for the maintenance of biodiversity. 3. Sward architecture was identified as the primary factor promoting increased species richness of both predatory and phytophagous trophic levels, as well as being positively correlated with mean body size. In all cases phytophagous invertebrate species richness was positively correlated with measures of plant species richness. 4. The direct effects of management practices appear to be comparatively weak, suggesting that their impacts are indirect and mediated though the continuous measures of plant community structure, such as sward architecture or plant species richness. 5. Synthesis and applications. By partitioning field margins from the remainder of the field, economically viable intensive grassland management can be combined with extensive management aimed at promoting native biodiversity. The absence of inorganic fertilizer, combined with a reduction in the intensity of both cutting and grazing regimes, promotes floral species richness and sward architectural complexity.

No previous study of bee spatial navigation has been able to follow animals’ movement during learning; we tracked bumblebee foragers continuously, using harmonic radar, and examined the process of route formation in detail for a small number of selected individuals. On our array, bees did not settle on visit sequences that gave the shortest overall path, but prioritised movements to nearby feeders. Nonetheless, flight distance and duration reduced with experience. This increased efficiency was attributable mainly to experienced bees reducing exploration beyond the feeder array and flights becoming straighter with experience, rather than improvements in the sequence of feeder visits. Flight paths of all legs of a flight stabilised at similar rates, whereas the first few feeder visits became fixed early while bees continued to experiment with the order of later visits.

To evaluate the risk of the returning flight of honeybee workers collecting water in comparison to nectar foraging bees three experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, workers drinking water from a watering trough and workers drinking sucrose solution from a feeder were caught and released a few hundred meters away. The proportion of water and nectar foragers returning to the nest was checked. In the second experiment only water-foraging workers displaced and released were tested. Some of them were allowed to drink water, and others were fed with sucrose solution immediately after reaching the watering trough. In both experiments the ratio of workers returning to the nests was significantly lower for those with water in their crops than for those with sucrose solution. The third experiment showed that experienced workers flying to the feeder with sucrose solution had less sugar in their crops (on average 0.1 mg) than did workers flyingto the water source (on average 0.2 mg), although both nectar and water foragers covered the same distance from the hive. These results consistently suggest that foragers with water in the crop have no reserve of metabolic fuel, so that they are facing a higher risk of not returning to the nest than nectar foraging bees.

For organisms living in highly structured groups of related individuals, such as colonies of social insects, personalities could also emerge at the group level. However, while numerous recent studies have investigated individual-level personality, the phenomenon of collective personality in animal groups has received little attention. In this paper, we apply the concept of collective personality to colonies of honeybees (Apis mellifera). We document the presence of consistent differences among colonies across a wide range of collective behaviours and demonstrate a link between colony-level personality traits and fitness. The colonies in our study showed consistent behavioural differences in traits such as defensive response, foraging activity and undertaking, and several of these traits were correlated as part of a behavioural syndrome. Furthermore, some of these traits were strongly tied to colony productivity and winter survival. Our results show that the concept of collective personality is applicable to colonies of social insects, and that personality differences among colonies can have important consequences for their long-term survival and reproduction. Applying the concept of personality to close-knit animal groups can provide important insights into the structure of behavioural variability in animal populations and the role that consistent between-group behavioural differences play in the evolution of behaviour. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","collective personalities in honeybee colonies are linked to colony fitness","Personality differences (i.e. consistent between-individual differences in behaviour) play an"

Using data on bees collected from 19 oak-savannah fragments, the question of whether bee communities differ when fragments are embedded in different landscapes (Douglas-fir forest vs. urban residential neighbourhoods) was investigated, and also whether these differences could be attributed to species-specific traits of bees (e.g. body size, specialization) and/or within-fragment floral resources. No differences were found in overall richness or abundance of bees, but there were distinct differences in plant and bee community composition between matrix types. Common wood-nesters and late-flying, small-bodied bees tended to be found in urban-associated fragments, which also had a lower availability of within-fragment floral resources. Forest-associated fragments, on the other hand, had a greater density and richness of early-flowering native plant species, and supported a higher abundance of large-bodied bee species. Bumble bee abundance, in particular, increased with increasing proportion of forest cover in the surrounding landscape. Large-bodied bees appear to respond to increased availability of within-fragment floral resources, but it was also hypothesised that nesting and floral resources in matrix habitat drive the differences in bee community assemblages.","floral resources, body size, and surrounding landscape influence bee community","1.

The wild pollinators need both fitting nesting sites and enough pollen and nectar resources. The evaluation model was based on different types of land use/cover. It used the availability of nesting sites and pollen and nectar resources which have important effect on wild pollinators' habitat and simulate its suitability of distribution (habitat quality index). It used the focal analysis method to simulate the potential quantity index of pollinator which flied to specific crops (the ability of pollination service) by integrating the max distance that wild pollinators travel to forage on flowers and the distribution of crops which need pollination. Taking the native wild Apis cerana Fabricius in Laojunshan Yunnan Province as an example, the simulated results of this model showed that the average habitat quality index of wild Apis cerana Fabricius in forest was the highest (2. 24 × 10 -2) because most wild Apis cerana Fabricius nested in tree cavities or earth cavities in forest of sunlit side and forest with abundant pollen and nectar resources. On the contrary, the average habitat quality index of wild Apis cerana Fabricius in cultivated vegetation area was the lowest (0. 37 × 10 -2) because the cultivated vegetation area had high intensity of human disturbance thus the natural environment and living condition were relatively poor. In the western study area, the farming region was scattered distribution which all located in Laojunshan National Nature Reserve thus pesticide and chemical fertilizer was rarely applied. It had abundant pollen and nectar resources and nesting sites supplied by the surrounding natural forest. The study area in eastern has lower relief on landform and larger population. The farming region was concentrated distribution and the vegetation type was single and surrounded by the secondary forest that had larger spatial obstacles of pollination. Therefore, from the holistic point of view, the spatial distribution pattern of ecosystem service ability was higher in the western area than in the eastern. In order to increase the farming region's pollination ability in the eastern area, improving the plant diversity on ridges of crop land was suggested. The concrete measures were planting considerable amount of herbaceous plants and (or) retaining a specific number of forest or wild weeds coexisted with crops.

A characteristic, and largely endemic, assemblage of plants has adapted to the environmental extremes that bare rock provides by strongly altering their morphology, physiology, and life history. With respect to their reproductive ecology, however, these plants appear, very similar to their congeners and to the Piedmont flora as a whole. Except for ant-pollinated Diamorpha smallii, most species show the expected range of pollen vectors, including wind, bees, flies, butterflies, moths and one species of hummingbird. Fruit and/or seed dispersal appears to be highly localised and effected primarily by wind and water. If anything, most species appear to possess adaptations against long-distance dispersal, which would carry propagules into the inhospitable matrix of oak-hickory-pine forest. Mating systems are variable, including examples of both self-compatible and self-incompatble taxa. Consistent with the expectation of low gene flow between populations on isolated outcrops, genetic data show strong differentiation and suggest the potential for genetic drift and/or natural selection to result in divergence. Some of the endemic species on granite outcrops have originated by allopolyploidy, whereas others appear to represent products of more gradual divergence in geographical isolation.

When subsequently released at windless unfamiliar locations, ants headed in the compass direction opposite to the one they had been blown away, thus functionally increasing their chance of returning to familiar areas. Ants do not appear to collect directional information during the actual passive displacement, but beforehand, while clutching the ground to resist the wind. During that time window, ants compute and store the compass direction of the wind.

Landmarks are used to chart a route or pinpoint a goal. The distant panorama, however, is often thought not to guide navigation directly during a familiar journey, but to act as a contextual cue that primes the correct memory of the landmarks. Results: We provided Melophorus bagoti ants with a huge artificial landmark located right near the nest entrance to find out whether navigating ants focus on such a prominent visual landmark for homing guidance. When the landmark was displaced by small or large distances, ant routes were affected differently. Certain behaviours appeared inconsistent with the hypothesis that guidance was based on the landmark only. Instead, comparisons of panoramic images recorded on the field, encompassing both landmark and distal panorama, could explain most aspects of the ant behaviours. Conclusion: Ants navigating along a familiar route do not focus on obvious landmarks or filter out distal panoramic cues, but appear to be guided by cues covering a large area of their panoramic visual field, including both landmarks and distal panorama.

However, empirical evidence to support this prediction is scarce. We investigated the influences of semi-natural habitats and nesting resources on concentration effect and waylaying effect of bees, as well as their consequences on crop pollination in landscapes. Ninety-seven vetch patches with independent gradients of size and distances to nesting sites were selected from 11 agricultural landscapes with independent gradients of surrounding semi-natural habitats and nesting resources. Semi-natural habitats and nesting resources were quantified either by field inspections or from satellite images; flower visitor densities and vetch pollination services were measured across overall flowering seasons. The proportion of semi-natural habitats did not modify the concentration effect or waylaying effect of the abundant and highly social honey bees or the solitary species Anthophora waltoni. The increase in area of brick walls, acting as nesting resources of A. waltoni, increased the concentration effect and the waylaying effect. For other solitary bees, the proportion of semi-natural habitats and the proportion of buildings did not influence the concentration effect or the waylaying effect. Honey bee density, A. waltoni density and other solitary bee density positively predict vetch pollination services.

Semi-track air-cushion vehicle (STACV) provides a solution to transportation on soft terrain, whereas it also brings a new problem of excessive fuel consumption. By mimicking the foraging behaviour of honeybees, the bioinspired adaptive bees algorithm (ABA) is proposed to calculate its running parameters for fuel economy optimization. Inherited from the basic algorithm prototype, it involves parallel-operated global search and local search, which undertake exploration and exploitation, respectively. The innovation of this improved algorithm lies in the adaptive adjustment mechanism of the range of local search (called 'patch size') according to the source and the rate of change of the current optimum. Three gradually in-depth experiments are implemented for 143 kinds of soils. First, the two optimal STACV running parameters present the same increasing or decreasing trend with soil parameters. This result is consistent with the terramechanics-based theoretical analysis. Second, the comparisons with four alternative algorithms exhibit the ABA's effectiveness and efficiency, and accordingly highlight the advantage of the novel adaptive patch size adjustment mechanism. Third, the impacts of two selected optimizer parameters to optimization accuracy and efficiency are investigated and their recommended values are thus proposed. © The Author 2010.

In a previous study of Lycoris sanguinea var. sanguinea, its effective pollinators, the visitation frequencies of each floral visitor, and its reproductive strategies were not identified. This study reports the observation that small bees visited flowers that were partially opened ( breaking buds). To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been reported previously. Further, this study investigates the hypothesis that small bees can pollinate at that flowering stage. This study demonstrates the basic methods of field experiments in pollination ecology using L. sanguinea var. sanguinea. Pollinator observations and digital video showed the visitation frequencies of each floral visitor. Bagging and cage experiments revealed that these flowers could be pollinated fully and that breaking-bud pollination could be important for the pollination of this plant species.

However, some pollinators can visit flowers before full opening and contribute to fruit and seed sets. In this paper, we researched the pollination biology of flowers just starting to open in four field experiments. We observed the insect visitors to Lycoris sanguinea var. sanguinea for 3 years at five sites. These observations revealed that only small bees, Lasioglossum japonicum, often entered through tiny spaces between the tepals of 'breaking buds' (i.e. partially opened flowers) and collected pollen. We hypothesized that they can pollinate this species at the breaking-bud stage, when the stigma is located near the anthers. To measure the pollination effect of small bees at the breaking-bud stage, we bagged several breaking buds after small bees had visited them and examined whether these buds were pollinated. In bagging experiments, 30 % of the breaking buds set fruit and seeds. Fruit-set ratios of the breaking buds did not differ significantly from those of the fully opened flowers, which had been visited by several insect species. We also counted the pollen grain numbers on the body of L. japonicum and on the anthers of randomly-selected and manipulated flowers. These experiments revealed that all of the captured bees had some pollen of target plants and that L. japonicum collected most of the pollen grains at the breaking-bud stage. Our results showed that the new pollination process, breaking-bud pollination, happened in breaking buds by L. japonicum, although there is no evidence to reveal that this is the most effective pollination method for L. sanguinea var. sanguinea. In principle, this new pollination process can occur in other flowering plants and our results are a major contribution to studies of plant-pollinator interactions.","breaking-bud pollination: a new pollination process in partially opened flowers","Plant-pollinator interactions have usually been researched in flowers that have"

Hence, we used an automatic measuring system to count passage events between a nest chamber and a foraging arena in five colonies of ants, Camponotus japonicus. The events were measured using radio-frequency identification tags attached to all workers of each colony. Here, we examined the detailed forms of i) labour distribution during foraging among workers in each colony and ii) the persistence of rank-order of foraging among workers. We found that labour distribution was characterized by a generalized gamma-distribution, indicating that only few workers carried out a large part of the workload. The rank-order of foraging activity among workers in each colony was maintained for a month and collapsed within a few months. We compared the obtained data with testable predictions of the RT model.

However, the abundance, diversity and health of wild pollinators are threatened by human activities such as anthropogenic climate impacts, habitat destruction and environmental pollutants, and the impact of these human activities on ecosystems is likely to increase. Despite recognizing the importance of wild pollinators and the implementation of targeted conservation programs, the contemporary threats of wild insect pollinators remain poorly understood. For the giant honey bee (Apis dorsata), an important wild pollinator and honey producer in tropical rainforests and agricultural areas across Asia, here we describe nest characteristics, colony migration and pollination role and review threats to their conservation. We found that A. dorsata nests featured a single honeycomb hanging from the branches of large trees. The bees undertook long distance migrations to locate seasonally ephemeral forage sources but regularly returned to previous nesting sites. We identified several anthropogenic activities that posed significant threats to A. dorsata conservation: harvesting entire colonies, deforestation, pesticide and herbicide utilization, parastioids, mites, pathogens and climate change. Based on our study, we recommend several conservation initiatives to pro-mote wild A. dorsata populations, which include artificial domestication, developing ecological agriculture, establishing of ecological corridors, inspection and quarantine controls on domesticated colonies, and sustainable utilization of the floral resources used by A. dorsata.

So far, the use of olfaction for food detection among raptors has only been demonstrated for Cathartes vultures. The Oriental honey buzzard (Pernis orientalis) is a resident and migrant in Taiwan and regularly forages in apiaries. One of its foods in apiaries is yellow pollen dough, a softball-sized mixture of pollen, soybeans, and sugar that beekeepers provide as a supplementary food for bees. Given that pollen dough is not similar to any naturally occurring food, we hypothesized that buzzards identify the dough's nutritious contents using olfaction, perhaps in combination with vision. Using a series of choice experiments in which individuals could choose between two doughs, we showed that (1) buzzards almost unerringly chose pollen-containing over pollen lacking doughs when otherwise the doughs were identical in size, shape, and yellow color; (2) buzzards always preferred yellow over black or green doughs if both doughs contained pollen; (3) buzzards still preferred pollen-containing over pollen-lacking doughs when both doughs were black, but at a lower rate than in (1).We statistically excluded the possible influences of the dough's relative brightness or of repeat visits by the same individuals. Our experiments thus suggest the use of a ""multi-modal foraging strategy"" among buzzards whereby olfaction and vision are likely to be both used in identifying food at close distances.We also estimated the olfactory receptor gene repertoire size in the buzzard's genome which is almost five times as large as that of three other raptor species. Therefore, olfaction is likely of far greater ecological importance to this species than to other raptor species. We suggest that olfaction should be considered in the design of behavioral and genetic studies to better understand the use of multiple senses in avian behaviors. © 2015 Yang et al.

These effects on pollination may depend on how pollinators respond to floral resources at multiple levels. In this study, we demonstrate pollinatormediated negative interactions between two invasive plants, Carduus acanthoides and Carduus nutans. Using constructed arrays of the two species, alone and in mixture, we quantified pollinator visitation at the patch and individual plant levels and measured seed production. We found that co-occurrence of our species led to a shift in pollinator services at both levels. Greater interference occurred when arrays were small and spacings between neighboring plants were large. Aspatially explicit movement model suggests that pollinator foraging behavior, which mediates the interactions between plants, was driven by floral display size rather than species identity per se. Pollinator behavior significantly reduced the proportion of seed set for both species relative to that in single-species arrays. Overall, the dependence of pollinator behavior on patch size, spacing between plants, and patch composition can lead to pollinator-mediated plant interactions that range from facilitative to competitive. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","pollinator behavior mediates negative interactions between two congeneric invasive plant","Simultaneously flowering plant species may indirectly interact with each other"

To test this, we created a greenhouse population of Mimulus guttatus plants that ranged in pollen viability from 17% to 98.5% and related both pollen quantity and pollen protein content to pollen viability. We found that crude protein concentration ranged from 15% to 45% and was positively associated with pollen viability. We also found that pollen mass per flower ranged 5-fold, also positively related to pollen viability. Across experimental plants, there was an 11-fold difference in protein mass per flower between plants of the lowest and highest pollen viabilities.

This adds a new dimension to bees' reproductive behaviour and spatial ecology, but the extent to which drifting occurs over field scales, i.e. at natural nest densities in field conditions, has been unclear. 2. Using the bumble bee Bombus terrestris (Linnaeus) as a model system, we sought to determine rates of worker drifting at field scales and the frequency of potential drifter workers in wild nests. 3. A field experiment with 27 colonies showed that workers travelled to, and became accepted in, conspecific nests that were up to 60m away, although the number of accepted drifter workers within nests fell significantly with distance. The rate at which nests were entered by drifters was relatively high and significantly exceeded the rate at which drifters became accepted. 4. Microsatellite genotyping of eight field-collected nests from Greater London, U.K., showed that a low frequency (3%) of workers were not full sisters of nestmate workers and hence were likely to have been drifter workers. 5. It is therefore concluded that workers can drift to conspecific nests over field scales and confirmed that successful drifting occurs in natural populations.

It is also known that they acquire this representation during an orientation flight performed on departure. A detailed film analysis shows that orientation flights in solitary wasps of the genus Cerceris consist of a systematic behavioural sequence: after lift-off from the nest entrance, wasps fly in ever increasing arcs around the nest. They fly along these arcs obliquely to their long axis and turn so that the nest entrance is held in the left or right visual field at retinal positions between 30° and 70° from the midline. Horizontal distance from the nest and height above ground increase throughout an orientation flight so that the nest is kept at retinal elevations between 45° and 60° below the horizon. The wasps' rate of turning is constant at between 100°/s and 200°/s independent of their distance from the nest and their ground velocity increases with distance. The consequence of this is that throughout the flight wasps circle at a constant angular velocity around the nest. Orientation flights are strongly influenced by landmark lay-out. Wasps adjust their flight-path and their orientation in a way that allows them to fixate the nest entrance and to hold the closest landmark in their frontal visual field. The orientation flight generates a specific topography of motion parallax across the visual field. This could be used by wasps to acquire a series of snapshots that all contain the nest position, to acquire snapshots of close landmarks only (distance filtering), to exclude shadow contours from their visual representation (figure-ground discrimination) or to gain information on the distance of landmarks relative to the nest. © 1993, Springer-Verlag.

In the species studied here (Uca lactea annulipes, Uca vomeris) a crab normally wanders no more than about 1 m away from its burrow and, when frightened, dashes back along a straight line to take cover. Feeding crabs tend to move sideways, without changing orientation, along paths radiating from the burrow. When they move along circumferential paths they adjust their orientation so that one side continues to point towards the burrow. The crabs do not need to see the burrow in order to stay aligned with the home vector, and they are not misled by a dummy hole close to their own burrow unless they have come to within about 10 cm of it. The home runs of crabs end within a few centimeters of a burrow that is covered with a sheet of sandpaper and then give way to search runs, centred upon a position slightly short of the burrow location. Feeding crabs can be displaced on sandpapers and their subsequent home runs end at a position where the burrow would be, had there been no displacement.

This paper examines the similarities that exist between an orientation flight made on departing from the nest and the subsequent return flight to the nest area. Returning wasps do not exactly retrace the paths they have flown during the preceding orientation flight. But there are striking similarities: in both types of flight wasps face into similar directions and their orientation depends on their position relative to nest and landmarks in a similar way. During both orientation flights and returns wasps fly along arcs while counter-turning at similar angular velocities. In both flights their flight direction and the retinal position of close landmarks are similar. Wasps on their return thus experience much the same spatio-temporal pattern of visual stimulation on their retina as they generated during their previous orientation flight. To discover whether wasps exploit the motion parallax information produced by these flights, the arrangement and size of landmarks was altered between the insects' departure and their return. Their search pattern for the hidden nest indicates (i) that they weight close landmarks more heavily than distant ones and (ii) that they frequently search at the appropriate distance from a landmark regardless of its apparent size. Both findings imply that returning wasps recall the patterns of visual motion produced during their orientation flights.","orientation flights of solitary wasps (cerceris, sphecidae, hymenoptera) .2. similarities","Cerceris wasps learn the position of their nest relative to"

In a typical learning flight, the insect backs away from the goal in a series of arcs that are roughly centred on the goal. The mean rate of turning is rather constant and tends to balance the angular speed at which the are is described, As a result, the insect views the goal at relatively fixed retinal positions in its left and right visual field, depending on flight direction. The general direction in which the insect backs away from the goal and the transition from one are segment to the next are influenced by the local scene and by compass cues. Insects returning to the goal repeat some of the flight manoeuvres of their preceding learning flights. Their orientation in space and the retinal positions at which they view nearby landmarks are similar. One important function of learning flights appears to be the acquisition of visual depth information, We review the consequences of the structure of learning flights for visual information processing and discuss how they may relate to the acquisition of a visual representation and the task of pinpointing the goal.","structure and function of learning flights in bees and wasps","Bees and wasps perform systematic flight manoevres when they leave"

For the purpose of estimating parameters of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) model, and inspired by the foraging behavior of bacteria and bees, a hybrid artificial bee colony (HABC) algorithm is proposed. The HABC uses an improved solution search equation that mimics the chemotactic effect of bacteria to enhance the local search ability. To avoid premature convergence and improve search accuracy, the adaptive Boltzmann selection scheme is adopted, which adjusts selective probabilities in different stages. Performance testing has been conducted on some typical benchmark functions. The results demonstrate that the HABC outperforms other methods (BIPOA, PSOPS and two improved GAs) in both convergence speed and accuracy. The proposed approach is applied to estimate the PEMFC model parameters and the satisfactory model predictive curves are obtained. More experimental results in different search ranges and validate strategies indicate that HABC is an efficient technique for the parameter estimation problem of PEMFC.

A field test plot of transgenic cotton (6 x 6 m) was planted in the middle of a nontransgenic field measuring 2 10 x 210 m. The results indicated that the pollen of Bt cotton or tfd A cotton could be dispersed into the environment. Out-crossing was highest within the central test plot where progeny from nontransgenic plants, immediately adjacent to transgenic plants, had resistant plant progeny at frequencies up to 10.48%. Dispersal frequency decreased significantly and exponentially as dispersal distance increased. The flow frequency and distance of tfd A and Bt genes were similar, but the pollen-mediated gene flow of tfd A cotton was higher and further to the transgenic block than that of Bt cotton (x(2) = 11.712, 1 degree of freedom, p < 0.001). For the tfd A gene, out-crossing ranged from 10.13% at I m to 0.04% at 50 m from the transgenic plants.

We applied it to several potential functions of quite different nature, i.e., the Coulomb-Born-Mayer, Lennard-Jones, Morse, Z and Gupta potentials. The benchmarks reveal that for long-ranged potentials the ABC algorithm is very efficient in locating the global minimum, while for short-ranged ones it is sometimes trapped into a local minimum funnel on a potential energy surface of large clusters.

We equip players with the particle swarm optimization technique, and find that it may lead to highly cooperative states even if the temptations to defect are strong. The concept of particle swarm optimization was originally introduced within a simple model of social dynamics that can describe the formation of a swarm, i.e., analogous to a swarm of bees searching for a food source. Essentially, particle swarm optimization foresees changes in the velocity profile of each player, such that the best locations are targeted and eventually occupied. In our case, each player keeps track of the highest payoff attained within a local topological neighborhood and its individual highest payoff. Thus, players make use of their own memory that keeps score of the most profitable strategy in previous actions, as well as use of the knowledge gained by the swarm as a whole, to find the best available strategy for themselves and the society. Following extensive simulations of this setup, we find a significant increase in the level of cooperation for a wide range of parameters, and also a full resolution of the prisoner's dilemma. We also demonstrate extreme efficiency of the optimization algorithm when dealing with environments that strongly favor the proliferation of defection, which in turn suggests that swarming could be an important phenomenon by means of which cooperation can be sustained even under highly unfavorable conditions. We thus present an alternative way of understanding the evolution of cooperative behavior and its ubiquitous presence in nature, and we hope that this study will be inspirational for future efforts aimed in this direction.","resolution of the stochastic strategy spatial prisoner's dilemma by means","We study the evolution of cooperation among selfish individuals in"

They are capable of detecting, recognising, tracking and capturing a rapidly moving object on the wing. These manoeuvres are usually completed in a couple of seconds. The interval of time between the absorption of light quanta by the photoreceptors and the generation of an appropriate behavioural response is very short, encompassing only a few tens of milliseconds. In this time the visual nervous system has, abstracted the essential features of the object, and recognized it (where appropriate), or measured its movement and computed an interception course. As an elementary unit of computation, we know that a neuron in the nervous system is considerably slower than, say, a flip-flop in the CPU of a modem computer. However, it is evident from the visual performance of an insect that the nervous system as a whole processes optical information much faster than a modem computer does. Rapid processing of visual information by animals therefore has to be attributed to the structure and the modus operandi of the nervous system.","behavioral evidence for parallel information-processing in the visual-system of insects","Many flying insects display remarkable visual agility in capturing prey"

The former is endemic to the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province, and the latter occupies southern China. Their morphological differences were associated with their different breeding systems indicated by pollen-ovule ratio (P/O). M. hangchouensis was predominantly outcrossing with P/O ranging from 756 to 6163 due to the variation among populations. Floral characters also showed that M. hangchouensis is an outcrosser: corolla tube 5∼10 mm long. 3∼5 mm wide, bright red; style 6∼15 mm long; stigma 1. 5∼2. 0 mm horizontally away from anthers. On the contrary. M. chinensis was predominantly a selfer with a low P/O ratio (P/O= 110). Its floral parameters contrasted sharply with M. hangchouensis: corolla tube 3. 0 mm long, 1. 0∼1. 5 mm wide, pale colored: style 2. 5 mm long, stigma close to or touching anthers. The pollinators of M. hangchouensis most frequently seen are: Bambus trifascitus Smith. , Scolia spp., Apis cerana Fabricius, Hylaeus sp. and Lasioglossum spp. These pollinators began to visit flowers at about 8 : 00 am, when flower buds were ready to open. When insects entered corolla tube for honey and (or) pollen, the stigmata touched the insects' body hairs to which pollen grains adhered, and pollen grains were transferred to the stigmata. Meanwhile the hairs collected pollen from anthers under the upper lips of corolla as the insects thrusted their bodies forward. Bumble bees and honey bees were considered more efficient pollinators because they were hair-rich and their body size fitted corolla tube fairly well. Due to the short flight distance of pollinators between two visits (average flight distances of honey bees and solitary bees were 0. 52 m and 0. 32 m respectively), pollen dispersal was probably restricted. Pollen vectors were important for the reproductive success of M. hangchouensis because 84. 3% of its seed-set depended on the pollinators' visitation. Although insects did pay visits to M. chinensis occasionally, such visitation was insignificant in seed-set due to cleistogamy. Discussions are made on the evolutionary significance of breeding system divergence between M. hangchouensis and M. chinensis, and the contribution of studies on pollination biology to conservation biology. Further studies are suggested for more thorough understanding of pollination biology of M. hangchouensis.","comparative studies on pollination biology of mosla hangchouensis and m.","Mosla hangchouensis Matsuda and M. chinensis Maxim. are sibling species."

Co-located soil and dust samples were simultaneously analysed with the objective of determining if the bees or their products had potential application as a proxy for monitoring environmental contamination. The most significant relationships were found between Pb concentrations in honey (r = 0.814, p = 0.014) and wax (r = 0.883, p = 0.004) and those in co-located dust samples. In addition, Zn concentrations in honey and soil were significantly associated (r = 0.709, p = 0.049). Lead isotopic compositions of native bee products collected from background sites adjacent to Sydney national parks (206Pb/207Pb = 1.144, 208Pb/207Pb = 2.437) corresponded to local geogenic rock and soil values (206Pb/207Pb = 1.123–1.176, 208Pb/207Pb = 2.413–2.500). By contrast, inner Sydney metropolitan samples, including native bees and wax (206Pb/207Pb = 1.072–1.121, 208Pb/207Pb = 2.348–2.409), co-located soil and dust (206Pb/207Pb = 1.090–1.122, 208Pb/207Pb = 2.368–2.403), corresponded most closely to aerosols collected during the period of leaded petrol use (206Pb/207Pb = 1.067–1.148, 208Pb/207Pb = 2.341–2.410). A large range of Pb isotopic compositions in beehive samples suggests that other legacy sources, such as Pb-based paints and industrials, may have also contributed to Pb contamination in beehive samples. Native bee data were compared to corresponding samples from the more common European honey bee (Apis mellifera). Although Pb isotopic compositions were similar in both species, significant differences in trace element concentrations were evident across the trace element suite, the bees and their products. The statistical association between T. carbonaria and co-located environmental contaminant concentrations were stronger than those in European honey bees, which may be attributable to its smaller foraging distance (0.3–0.7 km versus 5–9 km, respectively). This implies that T. carbonaria may be more suitable for assessing small spatial scale variations of trace element concentrations than European honey bees. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","tracing natural and industrial contamination and lead isotopic compositions in","Trace elements and Pb isotopic compositions of Australian native bees,"

The increased frequency of long-distance bee flights associated with the abundant low-quality reward blossoms in the nectar-robbed patch served to increase neighborhood size relative to the control area. Pollen was transported greater distances because of nectar thievery, thus making it more likely that the main purpose (genetic variability via outbreeding) of the chasmogamous flowers was achieved.

Here, we used microsatellite markers to investigate the effects of geographic distance and habitat fragmentation on gene flow among populations. Populations of Euglossa dilemma in three geographic regions-the Yucatán peninsula (Mexico), Veracruz (Mexico), and Florida (USA)-were genetically structured predominantly across the regions, with the strength of differentiation among populations being positively correlated with geographic distance. Within geographic regions only little substructure was found, suggesting that dispersal is substantial in the absence of geographic or ecological barriers.

To quantify the contribution of pollinators to oilseed rape yield, we manipulated pollinator access in a focal oilseed rape field in each landscape using open and closed cages. The pollinator communities in the focal fields were sampled using pan traps. The abundance of wild pollinators increased significantly with the proportion of cultivated land, but the diversity of the wild pollinator communities declined. The responses of pollinator abundance and diversity to cultivated land were best explained at scales of around 1000 m. The abundance of the unmanaged honey bee Apis cerana was positively associated with the proportion of cultivated land, whereas the abundance of the managed A. mellifera was not. A pollination services index (PSI) was calculated by comparing the reproductive investment in seeds between plants with or without pollinator access. PSI was positively correlated with wild pollinator abundance, but not with the abundance of honeybee species. PSI was also not significantly correlated with the area proportion of cultivated land. Our results indicate that crop dominated landscapes with numerous small fields supported an abundant, but relatively species poor bee community that delivered pollination services to oilseed rape. Conservation of (semi-)natural habitats, however, is important for maintaining the diversity of wild pollinators.","landscape effects on pollinator communities and pollination services in small-holder","Pollination by insects is key for the productivity of many"

Here we assessed how pollination services are delivered at the European scale. We used this assessment to estimate the relative contribution of wild pollinators to crop production. We developed an index of relative pollination potential, which is defined as the relative potential or relative capacity of ecosystems to support crop pollination. The model for relative pollination potential is based on the assumption that different habitats, but in particular forest edges, grasslands rich in flowers and riparian areas, offer suitable sites for wild pollinator insects. Using data of the foraging range of wild bees with short flight distances, we linked relative pollination potential to regional statistics of crop production. At aggregated EU level, the absence of insect pollination would result in a reduction of between 25% and 32% of the total production of crops which are partially dependent on insect pollination, depending on the data source used for the assessment. This production deficit decreases to 2.5% if only the relative pollination potential of a single guild of pollinators is considered. A strength of our approach is the spatially-explicit link between land cover based relative pollination potential and crop yield which enables a general assessment of the benefits that are derived from pollination services in Europe while providing insight where pollination gaps in the landscape occur. © 2013 by the authors.","linking land cover data and crop yields for mapping and","Pollination is a key ecosystem service as many crops but"

Foraging options of the bees were confined to host plant stands across different landscape structures. Differences in altitude of more than 130 m were overcome and forests covering a distance of up to 480 m were crossed by Chelostoma florisomne. A broad river and a motorway with intense traffic did not represent insurmountable barriers for Hoplitis adunca. For C. florisomne, total foraging distances of up to 650 m were measured, but foraging females were recorded predominantly on host plant patches available in relatively close vicinity to their nesting site. While landscape structures might impede foraging in endangered bees, the investigated landscape structures clearly did not act as insurmountable physical barriers for the two common solitary bee species tested in our study. © 2010 INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences.","are landscape structures insurmountable barriers for foraging bees? a mark-recapture","To investigate whether landscape structures act as insurmountable barriers for"

Solitary bees are central place foragers returning to their nests several times a day with pollen and nectar to provision their brood cells. They are especially susceptible to landscape changes that lead to an increased spatial separation of suitable nesting sites and flower rich host plant stands. While knowledge of bee foraging ranges is currently growing, quantitative data on the costs of foraging flights are very scarce, although such data are crucial to understand bee population dynamics. 2. In this study, the impact of increased foraging distance on the duration of foraging bouts and on the number of brood cells provisioned per time unit was experimentally quantified in the two pollen specialist solitary bee species Hoplitis adunca and Chelostoma rapunculi. Females nesting at different sites foraged under the same environmental conditions on a single large and movable flowering host plant patch in an otherwise host plant free landscape. 3. The number of brood cells provisioned per time unit by H. adunca was found to decrease by 23%, 31% and 26% with an increase in the foraging distance by 150, 200 and 300 m, respectively. The number of brood cells provisioned by C. rapunculi decreased by 46% and 36% with an increase in the foraging distance by 500 and 600 m, respectively. 4. Contrary to expectation, a widely scattered arrangement of host plants did not result in longer mean duration of a foraging bout in H. adunca compared to a highly aggregated arrangement, which might be due to a reduced flight directionality combined with a high rate of revisitation of already depleted flowers in the aggregated plant arrangement or by a stronger competition and disturbance by other flower visitors. 5. The results of this study clearly indicate that a close neighbourhood of suitable nesting and foraging habitats is crucial for population persistence and thus conservation of endangered solitary bee species. © 2010 The Authors.

Previous investigations predicted maximum foraging distances of 100-200 m for small bee species and up to 1100 m for very large species based on mainly indirect methods. The present study applied a new and direct approach to experimentally investigate maximum foraging distances in solitary bees. One endangered and two common species of different body sizes, all of which restrict pollen foraging to a single plant genus, were established in a landscape lacking their specific host plants. Females were forced to collect pollen on potted host plants that were successively placed in increasing distance from fixed nesting stands. The maximum foraging distance recorded for the small Hylaeus punctulatissimus was 1100 m, for the medium sized Chelostoma rapunculi 1275 m and for the large Hoplitis adunca 1400 m, indicating that maximum foraging distances at species level have been underestimated. However, the capability to use resources on such a large spatial scale applied only to a small percentage of individuals as 50% of the females of H. punctulatissimus and H. adunca did not forage at distances longer than 100-225 m and 300 m, respectively. This finding suggests that a close neighbourhood of nesting and foraging habitat within few hundred meters is crucial to maintain populations of these species, and that threshold distances at which half of the population discontinues foraging are a more meaningful parameter for conservation practice than the species specific maximum foraging distances. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
